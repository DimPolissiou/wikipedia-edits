The Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens, have ruled the planet for 1,000 years, and use human slave labor to strip its minerals and other resources, with a special desire for gold. A few primitive hunter-gatherer tribes of humans live in freedom in remote, hidden areas, but after ten centuries of Psychlo oppression they have abandoned any hope of regaining control of their planet. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ([[Barry Pepper]]) rejects this universal hopelessness and leaves his tribe in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration with a nomad hunter named Carlo ([[Kim Coates]]). Both are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp in the ruins of Denver, Colorado, the Psychlos' principal base of operations. A massive dome over the base protects the Psychlos from Earth's atmosphere, which is toxic to them.\n\nAt the camp, they meet Terl ([[John Travolta]]), the Psychlo security chief, and his deputy, Ker ([[Forest Whitaker]]). Terl's superiors have had him reassigned to his remote Earth outpost indefinitely due to one or more unexplained incidents involving \"the Senator's daughter\". He plans to bribe his way back to the Psychlo home planet by illegally mining gold in areas of high radioactivity. Psychlos avoid such areas because radiation reacts explosively with the gas mixture that they breathe. Terl observes that Jonnie is a resourceful human and selects him to lead the mining operation. Jonnie acquires a comprehensive knowledge of human history and literature in a Psychlo rapid-learning machine. He defiantly declares that one day, humans will overthrow the Psychlos and retake their planet. An amused Terl shows Jonnie the ruins of Denver and its public library and boasts that the Psychlos conquered all of Earth in only nine minutes early in the 21st century. Jonnie spends time in the library and is particularly inspired by the Declaration of Independence.\n\nTerl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to find gold. Jonnie locates a plentiful supply at the long-abandoned [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]]. He also discovers an abandoned underground military base with working [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets, weapons, and fuel. While they are supposed to be laboring in the mines, Jonnie and his followers plot a revolution, training themselves in aerial combat using the military base's flight simulators.\n\nAfter a week of training, the rebels launch their attack. In a suicide mission, Carlo flies his Psychlo flying shuttle into the Denver dome, destroying it and suffocating the Psychlos inside. Jonnie captures a teleportation device and uses it to teleport a [[dirty bomb]] to the Psychlo home world. When it detonates, the radiation it releases reacts catastrophically with the Psychlo atmosphere, destroying all life on the planet. The humans have retaken Earth, but face an uncertain future. The sole Psychlo survivors are Terl\u2014who is imprisoned inside Fort Knox, in a makeshift cell of gold bars, as a bargaining chip in the event of a counterattack by Psychlos living off their homeworld\u2014and Ker, who joins the victorious humans in their challenging project to rebuild their civilization.<ref name=\"sightsound\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[John Travolta]] as Terl\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Jonnie Goodboy Tyler\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Ker\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Carlo\n* [[Sabine Karsenti]] as Chrissy\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Robert the Fox\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Chirk\n* Michael MacRae as District Manager Zete\n* Shaun Austin-Olsen as Planetship Numph\n* Tim Post as the Assistant Planetship\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Parson staffer\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Mickey\n* Sylvain Landry as Sammy\n* [[Earl Pastko]] as the Bartender\n* No\u00ebl Burton as the Clinko Learning instructor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Initial deals ===\n==== 1982\u20131986: Hubbard period ====\nAfter ''Battlefield Earth'' was published in 1982, [[L.

Not only was the film released only three days after the 50th anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'', but the villainous Psychlos have been interpreted by many observers as an obvious allusion to Scientology's ''[[wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]'', psychiatry. The conflict between the Psychlos and the free humans can be seen as a reflection of Scientology's own conception of itself as fighting on behalf of humanity against the forces of psychiatry. The \"space opera\" genre of the book and film manifests itself in numerous places in Scientology itself, most famously in [[OT III]] (the [[Xenu]] story). Travolta's own commitment to such a disastrous project as the film version of ''Battlefield Earth'' is, in Urban's estimation, indicative of his \"unusual dedication\" to Scientology.<ref name=\"Urban2011\">{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-14608-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba/page/145 145]}}</ref>\n== Parodies ==\n''[[South Park]]'' [[Parody|parodied]] the film at the [[2000 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref name=\"ortega\">{{Cite news|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=Sympathy For The Devil: Tory Bezazian was a veteran Scientologist who loved going after church critics.

The Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens, have ruled the planet for 1,000 years, and use human slave labor to strip its minerals and other resources, with a special desire for gold. A few primitive hunter-gatherer tribes of humans live in freedom in remote, hidden areas, but after ten centuries of Psychlo oppression they have abandoned any hope of regaining control of their planet. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ([[Barry Pepper]]) rejects this universal hopelessness and leaves his tribe in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration with a nomad hunter named Carlo ([[Kim Coates]]). Both are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp in the ruins of Denver, Colorado, the Psychlos' principal base of operations. A massive dome over the base protects the Psychlos from Earth's atmosphere, which is toxic to them.\n\nAt the camp, they meet Terl ([[John Travolta]]), the Psychlo security chief, and his deputy, Ker ([[Forest Whitaker]]). Terl's superiors have had him reassigned to his remote Earth outpost indefinitely due to one or more unexplained incidents involving \"the Senator's daughter\". He plans to bribe his way back to the Psychlo home planet by illegally mining gold in areas of high radioactivity. Psychlos avoid such areas because radiation reacts explosively with the gas mixture that they breathe. Terl observes that Jonnie is a resourceful human and selects him to lead the mining operation. Jonnie acquires a comprehensive knowledge of human history and literature in a Psychlo rapid-learning machine. He defiantly declares that one day, humans will overthrow the Psychlos and retake their planet. An amused Terl shows Jonnie the ruins of Denver and its public library and boasts that the Psychlos conquered all of Earth in only nine minutes early in the 21st century. Jonnie spends time in the library and is particularly inspired by the Declaration of Independence.\n\nTerl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to find gold. Jonnie locates a plentiful supply at the long-abandoned [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]]. He also discovers an abandoned underground military base with working [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets, weapons, and fuel. While they are supposed to be laboring in the mines, Jonnie and his followers plot a revolution, training themselves in aerial combat using the military base's flight simulators.\n\nAfter a week of training, the rebels launch their attack. In a suicide mission, Carlo flies his Psychlo flying shuttle into the Denver dome, destroying it and suffocating the Psychlos inside. Jonnie captures a teleportation device and uses it to teleport a [[dirty bomb]] to the Psychlo home world. When it detonates, the radiation it releases reacts catastrophically with the Psychlo atmosphere, destroying all life on the planet. The humans have retaken Earth, but face an uncertain future.

Not only was the film released only three days after the 50th anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'', but the villainous Psychlos have been interpreted by many observers as an obvious allusion to Scientology's ''[[wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]'', psychiatry. The conflict between the Psychlos and the free humans can be seen as a reflection of Scientology's own conception of itself as fighting on behalf of humanity against the forces of psychiatry. The \"space opera\" genre of the book and film manifests itself in numerous places in Scientology itself, most famously in [[OT III]] (the [[Xenu]] story).

The company alleged that Franchise had defrauded it to the tune of over $75 million by systematically submitting \"grossly fraudulent and inflated budgets\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|title=$75M Battlefield Over Film Flops|work=New York Post|date=January 19, 2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe case was heard before a jury in a Los Angeles federal courtroom in May\u2013June 2004. The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of ''Battlefield Earth'' was $44&nbsp;million, not the $75 million declared by Franchise. The remaining $31 million had been fraudulent \"padding\". Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded ''Battlefield Earth'' because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the [[Wesley Snipes]] vehicle ''[[The Art of War (film)|The Art of War]]'' and the [[Bruce Willis]] comedy ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]''.<ref name=\"variety_10may04\"/> Baeres testified that \"Mr. Samaha said, 'If you want the other two pictures, you have to take ''Battlefield Earth'' \u2014 it's called packaging'\".

Sarah, Belle, Emily, Katherine, Danielle were invited on this date.  Sarah had a cuddle at the wheel with Tim.  After some lessons on navigation and dropping the sail, they all spotted a Whale swimming close by.  Later in the day, they all jumped into the sea for a swim and Tim selected Katherine for a date back at his Pad and a home cooked meal of Lamb roast.  Katherine received a rose.\n\n'''Pure fantasy date:''' Tim had a double date with Laura and Rochelle.  The girls were taken to Darling Hotel overlooking Sydney Harbour where they got dressed up in evening gowns and awaited Tim who took them to a jewelry store wherein they were given the run of the store and were lent a piece of their choice for the evening.  Both girls chose earrings.  The next venue was Curzon Hall for a romantic dinner but the atmosphere was awkward.  Towards the end of the dinner, Tim took Laura out to the rotunda in the garden in hope of getting to know her better, but there was no spark and she again, didn't open up.  After escorting her back and bringing Rochelle outside, Rochelle had an open heart discussion with Tim.  Tim chose to eliminate Laura. Tim then surprised Rochelle with a gift of diamond stud earrings and a rose.\n\n'''Rose ceremony:''' Stacey is eliminated.\n\n===Episode 6===\n'''Original airdate:''' 2 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-6|title= Episode 6 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''Group date:''' \nAll of the remaining 12 girls were invited on a farm day at Calmsley Hill Farm at Abbotsbury, 40&nbsp;km west of Sydney.  Tim stated he wanted to see who embraced the simple life with a view into knowing a little more about his future partner. From the group, Tim took Dani to feed new born lambs and Sarah to feed a calf.  Later, a challenge was set to herd sheep into a pen and Anna won the challenge.  This gave them some time apart from the group and they shared a kiss they then talked of how they missed each other in the last few weeks since their one on one date.   Tim told Anna he felt a connection with her.  Towards the late afternoon, Tim told the girls he had a surprise set for the evening - a traditional barn dance.  At nights' end, he thanked the girls for a great day and handed an envelope over which was a one on one date invitation and Natalie was selected.\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\nTim and Natalie went rock climbing in the Blue Mountains.  After a tricky steep climb up, they enjoyed the vast views from atop and then Tim took Natalie into the Jenolan Caves where they shared some conversation and wine in the quiet solitude surrounded by lots of candles, which set a romantic mood.  However, Natalie intimated she was looking more for a mate long term, rather than marriage.  She also asked Tim to guess how old she was.  As she was the oldest of the bachelorettes she asked if that bothered him.  He gave Natalie a rose.\n \n'''Cocktail party:'''  A small group ambush was being formed by Alana to hijack anyone that Tim took down into the garden, for a one on one chat.  He selected Ashlee who became heavy-handed asking what his intentions were and he was uncomfortable explaining he had to share what time he had with all of the girls.  She felt she was wasting her time, waiting to go on a date with him.  Alana, Belle and Danielle with a reluctant Rochelle trailing behind, broke up their conversation and cornered Tim at the pool bar, badgering him for more consistency with personal time and one on one dating in order to 'get to know each other better.'\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith 11 girls and 8 roses to give out - 3 were to go home!  \nAnna, Danielle, Sarah, Rochelle, Katherine, Penny, Ali and Emily received Roses. \nBelle, Ashlee and Alana were eliminated.  Alana whispered to Tim that Rochelle was the girl for him, Belle saying that either Rochelle or Anna was his girl as they each kissed him goodbye.\n\n===Episode 7===\n'''Original airdate:''' 9 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-7|title= Episode 7 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\n\"Indulge all your senses\" invitation arrived and Danielle was Tim's one on one date.  They were whisked away by sea plane to Berowra Waters Inn by the Hawkesbury River and indulged in a four course meal.  Dani received a rose at the end of their date and they shared a kiss.  In a cut-away scene, he said he wasn't sure what made her tick.  \n \nIt was noted by the rest of the girls back at the house that Dani was in every group date and discussed they all agreed she was a mean girl - putting on a facade when Tim was around and was different when she was just with the other bachelorettes.  Penny was hoping her turn for a one on one date would appear soon as she felt she was being overlooked.\n \n'''Group date:''' \nWhilst Tim was away on his date, an invitation arrived for the group date.  Sarah, Ali, Emily, Rochelle and Penny were chosen to meet up with Tim at the Australian Guide Dogs training centre.  Each were given a puppy to 'train' and play with.  First up, they were taken into the kennels to do a poop-scoop which Rochelle balked at.  Tim then asked Ali to attend another chore which was to wash 2 puppies and Ali and Tim enjoyed a little time alone catching-up.\n \nTim was wondering who in the group was the most nurturing, comforting and loving with the puppies and chose Sarah as the most natural with those qualities -  her prize from the group date was an evening alone in a pocket of bushland where they lit an open fire and toasted marshmallows.\n \nThe next morning, Tim arrived at the house unannounced to surprise the girls who had just woken and were mingling in the kitchen in their PJ's and onesies.  He wanted to cook them a hot breakfast, and wondered who was the most comfortable in their own skin sans make-up 'au naturel' .\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith only 6 roses to give out to the remaining 7 contestants, Tim handed roses to Rochelle, Ali, Anna, Katherine and Natalie.  With the final rose left, Tim excused himself momentarily then returned, asking Emily to accompany him outside wherein he explained he didn't think they had a connection and that she had a wall up.  He also said he didn't want her to stand on the staircase alone and that it was her time to go.  Thus Emily was eliminated and Tim returned giving Penny the final rose.\n\n===Episode 8===\n'''Original airdate:''' 16 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-8|title= Episode 8 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n  \n'''Group date:''' \nAll the girls were flown interstate from Sydney to Broome, Western Australia.  From Perth, the capital of Western Australia, Broome is 2229&nbsp;km (1385 miles.)  They flew by private plane to the Crown Jewel of the Broome Coast, to Eco Beach a beautiful and rugged part of the Kimberley region of north Western Australia.  They arrived to meet with Tim who was seen from the beach, standing on a Catamaran, the Karma IV a 70' luxurious catamaran, waving at them.  Natalie, chose not the join the group as she had a phobia about boats.  Tim, loving his outdoor sport and adventures was keen to see who shared his love of the water.  Penny grabbed an opportunity to rub Tim down with sun screen much to Sarah's annoyance.  Sarah said she 'shuts down' on group dates and remained moody.  Anna stated she was on fire and after jumping in the sea, the current was strong and she started to drift away, so Tim jumped in and went in for the rescue.  He said, it was a smart move on her behalf if it was a ploy to get a bit of 1 on 1 time with him.\n \nOn the speed boat back to the beach, Rochelle spotted Tim caressing Anna's hand on the rail discreetly and made comment that Anna and Tim had a strong bond and that she needs to step it up.\n \nNatalie appeared and joined them but not all the girls were pleased to see her.  \n \nTim then announced he can only take one girl on a date and he chose Penny.  They sat by a campfire and shared wine and conversation, Penny telling Tim about her divorce and how she was looking for love and she told him she was falling in love with him.  Tim didn't feel there was a spark between them and felt conflicted.  He didn't want to lead Penny on.  He felt there was more of a friendship that they shared.\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\n\"Catch it if you can\" invitation arrived back at the resort and Anna was chosen for a one on one date.  The next morning Tim and Anna headed off on a 4WD driving the expanse of the isolated beach and met with a guide who was going to show them how to catch mud crabs in the mangroves.   Later Tim and Anna ventured on to a picnic on the beach and shared some intimate discussions about their feelings for each other.  Tim was impressed that Anna was not needy for love after she stated that at 26 years old, she's never had a boyfriend.  In a cut away scene he stated he had a huge crush on Anna and loved her playful energy and that he felt, he was falling for Anna after experiencing giddiness and butterflies.  Anna received a rose. \n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nBack at the cocktail party before the Rose Ceremony was to take place, Tim took Sarah aside and she had a small altercation with Tim privately about not feeling comfortable on group dates and hence why she gets reserved and that she felt uncomfortable seeing him with the other girls.  Tim felt worldliness and maturity was stronger with some girls in the group.  Back inside, the mood was mellow as all the girls were feeling insecure about Tim.\n \nTim asked Rochelle to go for a walk and told her he felt he had a connection with her.   The roses were then handed out, to Ali, Sarah, Rochelle, Danielle, Katherine and Natalie.  Penny was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 9===\n'''Original airdate:''' 23 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-9|title= Episode 9 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nAs this episode opened with seven girls remaining, they are still having their week in Broome.  Tim said he is in his head a lot but feels he has to now start thinking with his heart.  The scene opens with the girls swimming in the sea and were called to the beach to read the new invitation, which Katherine read out. Rochelle stated she hadn't had a one-on-one date as yet. Sarah said she was hoping for a second date so they could spend more time with Tim on a one on one.  \n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\nRochelle was chosen for \"Are You Ready to come out of your Shell\" date.  As Tim drove Rochelle along a bumpy bush gravel road towards her surprise, they arrived to see a boat waiting for them to go pearl fishing.  As they were heading for the precise spot along the river, Tim was delighting in seeing different layers emerge from Rochelle during their conversation.   \n \nTim found a shell that he handed to Rochelle who then pulled out a natural pearl which was hers to keep.  Tim and Rochelle headed back to the Resort for champagne in the evening gardens then went for an intimate spa.  \nRochelle received a Rose. \n \n'''Group date:''' \nBack at Cable Beach Club Resort and Spa the girls were having a casual game of tennis when another invitation arrived.  Anna read out the invitation themed 'Fly to Sea - Two from Three'.  Sarah Ali and Dani were invited.  There were gasps all round - someone is going home!  The girls were flown out in a helicopter to the awaiting catamaran 'Great Escape' which had a landing pad on it.  There was much excitement and screaming inside the cabin but the girls felt trepidation as one wasn't coming back.   When they landed and greeted Tim who was awaiting their arrival, they said it felt like they were in a James Bond film.  Dani stated she was glad she was with Ali and Sarah as she didn't care for their feelings and hoped she wasn't going home.\n \nThe date had the girls jumping from a rope that was rigged up to swing them out like a pendulum wherein they had to let go once they were out far enough.  Sarah went first and did a flop, followed by Ali and then Dani.  Ali decided to have another go but once she was out the rope started to spin her wildly and she fell hard on the water, injuring her knee.  After being brought on board by the crew, she was in shock and it was decided to get the helicopter to pick her up to take her to the hospital.  Tim was worried that Ali might not be able to continue in the show.  He said he was upset and felt she was perfect because she was so positive even after the accident and suffering in pain. \n \nSarah and Dani were worried it would be one of them to go home as Tim wouldn't send Ali home under those conditions.  However, the date was abandoned and they returned to the Resort. \n \nNatalie said Sarah needs to grow up before she gets married and be in a relationship (Sarah is 22).\n \nThe girls were chatting waiting for Tim's arrival and were surprised at Sarah's lack of sympathy about Tim taking Ali to the hospital and staying by her side.  \nIt was unknown if Ali would be present at the Rose Ceremony.  Tim said Ali being in hospital had a massive impact on him and all he could think about, was Ali.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nIn the garden, the mood was flat, awaiting news of Ali and which two were being sent home.  Tim walked in and said he felt the tension.  They asked after Ali and he said she was doing well.  \nSuddenly, Ali appeared hobbling on crutches.\n \nTim only had four roses to give out to the remaining six girls and in order, Ali, Anna, Katherine and Dani received the roses.  Natalie and Sarah were eliminated.\n\n===Episode 10===\n'''Original airdate:''' 30 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-10|title= Episode 10 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nThis week's episode informs that Tim must choose which four out of the five remaining contestants, he will choose to go on hometown dates with.  \nThe contestants are mingling on the balcony with their morning coffee, an invitation arrives for a 'one on one date' and Katherine was selected for the \"Journey from the Past into the Future\" date.   Dani speculated that it could be a visit to a museum.\n\n'''One-on-one date:'''\nA limo pulled up and we see Tim and Katherine head off to a surprise date.  Tim is concerned about Katherine as she is still quite reserved but he wanted to know if the feelings and great night they previously shared back at his place, could be rekindled.  They finally arrived in the dark of night to a paddock - Tim covers Kath's eyes and walks her to a machine and tells her to pull the lever whereupon a Fun Fair amusement park lit up.  After going on various rides and making fairy floss, they made their way to some hay bales to have champagne and to talk.  Although a rose was tantalizingly sitting beside them, Tim elected not to give Katherine the rose as he didn't want to get swept up on the date and make a rash decision.  Katherine returned to the house with two stuffed animals but no rose, much to the remaining contestant's quiet delight.\n \n'''Group date:''' \nThe group date saw Ali, Danielle, Anna and Rochelle being taken to an Art Gallery to get their interpretation on a few pieces of art. They were then requested to go upstairs to the VIP Gallery for a surprise.  Tim escorted Anna up first where they were met with a display of her childhood memorabilia.  Ali, Dani then Rochelle were escorted up separately with Tim and they each talked about fond moments and memories as presented in the display.\n \n'''Cocktail party:'''\nThe atmosphere was intense as the girls waited for Tim to arrive.  Upon his arrival he decided to take personal time out in the garden for a chat first with Ali, then Katherine and finally Rochelle - wanting to clear a few more questions he had.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nTim gave the first rose to Anna, then Danielle, Ali and finally the 4th rose, to Rochelle.  Katherine was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 11===\n'''Original airdate:''' 6 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-11|title= Episode 11 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nThis week's episode - Meet the Families.\n  \nFirst stop was Goulburn, Anna's hometown.  Anna was quite nervous as she had never brought a boyfriend home to meet her parents before.  When Tim arrived in town, Anna showed him some of the township and revisited her primary school.  Tim said he felt scared upon learning Anna's dad was a lawyer and being cross-examined.  Anna also told Tim unfortunately her two sisters couldn't be there, as they both lived overseas, however, after coming home and introducing Tim to her mum, there were squeals of joy as her two sisters appeared in a wonderful surprise.   After Anna's father arrived, he gave Tim a bit of a gruelling session, then stated to the camera that he was impressed with Tim and found him personable and genuine.  Tim said he felt very comfortable with the whole family.\n \nNext was a visit to Perth, Western Australia \u2013  to meet Rochelle's parents.  When Tim arrived, Rochelle and he went off for a game of mini-golf and a cold beer at the Waterfront.  Afterwards they headed off home to meet with Rochelle's parents.  During the course of dinner and the evening's conversation, Rochelle went introverted, which had Tim perplexed and it was awkward.  Rochelle again stated she was too scared to open up fully to love.\n \nThird, was a visit to the Gold Coast in sunny Queensland to visit Danielle's mum and sister.  Firstly however, they met and went for a picnic and swim to the Currumbin Rock Pools.  Danielle told Tim she hadn't really informed her mum about going on the show and that her mother only found out with short notice, that Tim was coming over for lunch to meet her.  She felt quite anxious about her mother's reaction as she could be quite 'conservative'.  Dani's mum and Tim had a quiet moment together in the garden and surprisingly enjoyed each other's company in that short time.  This left a good impression and Dani's mum felt more relaxed than at the start of the home visit.  Tim didn't feel the relationship would go any deeper as Dani was still very reserved and had huge walls up.\n \nFinally, over to the Adelaide Hills, in South Australia, to meet Ali's parents and brother.  Tim was excited to see Ali again and stated he loved her radiating energy.  Ali took Tim to a small German township called Hahndorf where they shared one huge hotdog German style and couldn't finish it.  Ali told Tim her parents had never approved of any ex-boyfriends she brought home previously for them to meet and she was very anxious as she wanted their approval.  Ali's dad and Tim went for a chat in the garden and he asked Tim what had happened to Ali's leg when she had the accident in Broome.  Later, Ali's parents had a private chat with her and asked her how she felt about Tim and what would she say if he asked for her hand in marriage.  Ali's dad was happy to see his daughter so taken by Tim and thought they made a really good match. \n \n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith four girls left and only 3 roses to give out, Tim was in a dilemma about Rochelle and Danielle - the two home visits that didn't go so well.\nAli received the first rose followed by Anna.  Tim then asked Rochelle to go outside as he still had a few questions to ask her.  After escorting her back inside, he then took Danielle outside for a brief moment.\nThe third rose went to Rochelle and Danielle was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 12===\n'''Original airdate:''' 13 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-12|title= Episode 12 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n'''Overnight dates:'''\nWith the final 3 contestants left, Tim first met up with Ali and they went for a drive in a Porsche up to the Blue Mountains countryside and had a small picnic.  Tim stated that if he wasn't dating all 3 girls at once, he could see himself falling for Ali, but, it was difficult as he 'had feelings for all 3 girls'.  That night during dinner at a cabin in the Blue Mountains, Ali declared her love for Tim again.  Tim didn't feel it was fair to say anything back whilst dating 2 other girls stating that he couldn't fully allow himself to feel that (love).  After dinner, sitting by the log fire, he handed an envelope to Ali which had a note and key inside inviting them to stay the night as a couple.  Tim declined saying it wouldn't be fair on the other girls. \n \nNext, we see Tim meeting Rochelle for a cruise on a luxury yacht 'Aqua Bay' on Sydney Harbour.  He felt she still had barriers up and withheld secrets.  Rochelle felt she was falling in love with Tim.  Tim again stated to Rochelle, how important communication between them was to him.  They headed off taking in the stunning and unbelievable Sydney Harbour views, to a secluded beach called Store Beach, for a picnic and swim.   They also thought it would be fun to write a 'message in a bottle' and threw it into the sea.   That evening over a platter of a variety of seafood on board the yacht, Tim said to Rochelle 'I love my time with you and I want to keep continuing this'.  When the desserts arrived, as they were lounging on the back deck, an invitation and key was on the tray offering them to stay the night as a couple, if they wished.  Tim again declined to stay the night.\n\nFinally, Tim met with Anna for their date in the botanic gardens and had a canape and champagne brunch.  Tim reflected on how they banter well, and how being with Anna is easy and fun.  Tim asked Anna outright 'I need to know what you are feeling and more importantly, what you see in me'.  Anna stated the problems in not having boyfriends in the past was probably due to her not being open about her emotions.  She said she wanted to make sure Tim was right for her as well.  Tim said he needed to know that Anna really knew who he was.  Anna replied she would try and be more open but didn't want to fall for Tim 100% due to the possibility of being hurt and not end up being with him.  After dinner, at the Milton Park Country House, Bowral - (125&nbsp;km south of Sydney) they retired to the fireside and read the awaiting invitation letter and key to stay the night.  Tim explained he didn't feel comfortable staying the night with any of the girls due to respect for all the 3 finalists as he had strong feelings for each of them and it just didn't feel right.\n\nPrior to the Rose Ceremony, we see Tim heading into Bunda Jewellers in the city, to ask for help in getting an engagement ring designed, which would express the emotions and feelings he had whilst on this journey and wished for it to be featured in the original design.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nTwo roses are shown on the tray and with 3 finalists left - Ali, Anna and Rochelle. Prior to entering the Rose Ceremony, Tim was given a recording from each of them, to view, by the Host to assist Tim in his final decision.  The girls awaited separately in the garden, each stating they would be devastated if they didn't get a rose that night.\n\nRochelle received the first rose, followed by Anna and in a shock elimination, Ali was eliminated and left, broken-hearted.\n \nIn the next Episode the final 2 - Anna and Rochelle - travel to Thailand where the final rose will be handed out.  This trip will also see Tim's parents in Thailand wherein Tim's mother will get to meet the final two contestants.\n\n===Episode 13===\n'''Original airdate:''' 20 November 2013\n\nIn the season Finale, Tim's quest for love reaches its dramatic conclusion on the stunning coast of Thailand, staying at the Pullman Phuket Arcadia resort in Phuket.  Tim's family get to meet the final two girls, Anna and Rochelle.\n\n'''Meet Tim's family:'''\nRochelle was the first finalist to be introduced to Tim's family over lunch.  Tim's mum had a private and probing conversation with Rochelle and thought Rochelle hadn't completely let her walls down.\nNext it was Anna's turn to be introduced to the family and they noticed how uplifting her energy was and how Tim couldn't stop smiling.  Tim's sister commented that Tim was being 'himself when he was with Anna'.  Tim's mother also had a private chat with Anna and Anna found some of the questions daunting and intense and discovered she had to admit she was in love with Tim.\n\n'''Final dates:'''\nTim has two final dates - Tim states 'it has gone from who will get the final rose to who will get all of my heart.'\n\nTim's first final date was with Anna - his surprise was a trip on a speed boat to an awaiting traditional Chinese Junk in the middle of Phang Nga Bay.   They jumped off the Junk and swam to shore where they had some alone time.  That evening, they went to a fire twirling dancing show.  After the show, Anna gave Tim a gift box of cards she had drawn up, some 40, which she read out, the many and different reasons she loved him and she finally declared that she was falling madly in love with him.\n\nOn Tim & Rochelle's final date, they met in the jungle and went for an elephant ride to the sea.  That evening, they chatted privately, under the majestical starry night.\n\n'''Final decision:'''\nRochelle was first to walk down the path on the cliffside of the Resort, to hear Tim's final decision. 'There is only one girl I can't live without' Tim declared to the camera.  With Rochelle standing before him,  he told Rochelle his 'heart was leading somewhere else' and Rochelle was not chosen to be the one he had fallen deeply in love with.\n\nWhen Anna walked towards Tim for the final decision and greeted him, he said 'you have my heart and I have fallen deeply and madly in love with you'.   He then pulled out a small gift box which was the ring he had designed which was of two bands of platinum with an infinity loop, symbolizing their journey together and moving forward.  He slipped it onto Anna's middle finger of her right hand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrnes|first=Holly|url=

Sarah, Belle, Emily, Katherine, Danielle were invited on this date.  Sarah had a cuddle at the wheel with Tim.  After some lessons on navigation and dropping the sail, they all spotted a Whale swimming close by.  Later in the day, they all jumped into the sea for a swim and Tim selected Katherine for a date back at his Pad and a home cooked meal of Lamb roast.  Katherine received a rose.\n\n'''Pure fantasy date:''' Tim had a double date with Laura and Rochelle.  The girls were taken to Darling Hotel overlooking Sydney Harbour where they got dressed up in evening gowns and awaited Tim who took them to a jewelry store wherein they were given the run of the store and were lent a piece of their choice for the evening.  Both girls chose earrings.  The next venue was Curzon Hall for a romantic dinner but the atmosphere was awkward.  Towards the end of the dinner, Tim took Laura out to the rotunda in the garden in hope of getting to know her better, but there was no spark and she again, didn't open up.  After escorting her back and bringing Rochelle outside, Rochelle had an open heart discussion with Tim.  Tim chose to eliminate Laura. Tim then surprised Rochelle with a gift of diamond stud earrings and a rose.\n\n'''Rose ceremony:''' Stacey is eliminated.\n\n===Episode 6===\n'''Original airdate:''' 2 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-6|title= Episode 6 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''Group date:''' \nAll of the remaining 12 girls were invited on a farm day at Calmsley Hill Farm at Abbotsbury, 40&nbsp;km west of Sydney.  Tim stated he wanted to see who embraced the simple life with a view into knowing a little more about his future partner. From the group, Tim took Dani to feed new born lambs and Sarah to feed a calf.  Later, a challenge was set to herd sheep into a pen and Anna won the challenge.  This gave them some time apart from the group and they shared a kiss they then talked of how they missed each other in the last few weeks since their one on one date.   Tim told Anna he felt a connection with her.  Towards the late afternoon, Tim told the girls he had a surprise set for the evening - a traditional barn dance.  At nights' end, he thanked the girls for a great day and handed an envelope over which was a one on one date invitation and Natalie was selected.\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\nTim and Natalie went rock climbing in the Blue Mountains.  After a tricky steep climb up, they enjoyed the vast views from atop and then Tim took Natalie into the Jenolan Caves where they shared some conversation and wine in the quiet solitude surrounded by lots of candles, which set a romantic mood.  However, Natalie intimated she was looking more for a mate long term, rather than marriage.  She also asked Tim to guess how old she was.  As she was the oldest of the bachelorettes she asked if that bothered him.  He gave Natalie a rose.\n \n'''Cocktail party:'''  A small group ambush was being formed by Alana to hijack anyone that Tim took down into the garden, for a one on one chat.  He selected Ashlee who became heavy-handed asking what his intentions were and he was uncomfortable explaining he had to share what time he had with all of the girls.  She felt she was wasting her time, waiting to go on a date with him.  Alana, Belle and Danielle with a reluctant Rochelle trailing behind, broke up their conversation and cornered Tim at the pool bar, badgering him for more consistency with personal time and one on one dating in order to 'get to know each other better.'\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith 11 girls and 8 roses to give out - 3 were to go home!  \nAnna, Danielle, Sarah, Rochelle, Katherine, Penny, Ali and Emily received Roses. \nBelle, Ashlee and Alana were eliminated.  Alana whispered to Tim that Rochelle was the girl for him, Belle saying that either Rochelle or Anna was his girl as they each kissed him goodbye.\n\n===Episode 7===\n'''Original airdate:''' 9 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-7|title= Episode 7 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\n\"Indulge all your senses\" invitation arrived and Danielle was Tim's one on one date.  They were whisked away by sea plane to Berowra Waters Inn by the Hawkesbury River and indulged in a four course meal.  Dani received a rose at the end of their date and they shared a kiss.  In a cut-away scene, he said he wasn't sure what made her tick.  \n \nIt was noted by the rest of the girls back at the house that Dani was in every group date and discussed they all agreed she was a mean girl - putting on a facade when Tim was around and was different when she was just with the other bachelorettes.  Penny was hoping her turn for a one on one date would appear soon as she felt she was being overlooked.\n \n'''Group date:''' \nWhilst Tim was away on his date, an invitation arrived for the group date.  Sarah, Ali, Emily, Rochelle and Penny were chosen to meet up with Tim at the Australian Guide Dogs training centre.  Each were given a puppy to 'train' and play with.  First up, they were taken into the kennels to do a poop-scoop which Rochelle balked at.  Tim then asked Ali to attend another chore which was to wash 2 puppies and Ali and Tim enjoyed a little time alone catching-up.\n \nTim was wondering who in the group was the most nurturing, comforting and loving with the puppies and chose Sarah as the most natural with those qualities -  her prize from the group date was an evening alone in a pocket of bushland where they lit an open fire and toasted marshmallows.\n \nThe next morning, Tim arrived at the house unannounced to surprise the girls who had just woken and were mingling in the kitchen in their PJ's and onesies.  He wanted to cook them a hot breakfast, and wondered who was the most comfortable in their own skin sans make-up 'au naturel' .\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith only 6 roses to give out to the remaining 7 contestants, Tim handed roses to Rochelle, Ali, Anna, Katherine and Natalie.  With the final rose left, Tim excused himself momentarily then returned, asking Emily to accompany him outside wherein he explained he didn't think they had a connection and that she had a wall up.  He also said he didn't want her to stand on the staircase alone and that it was her time to go.  Thus Emily was eliminated and Tim returned giving Penny the final rose.\n\n===Episode 8===\n'''Original airdate:''' 16 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-8|title= Episode 8 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n  \n'''Group date:''' \nAll the girls were flown interstate from Sydney to Broome, Western Australia.  From Perth, the capital of Western Australia, Broome is 2229&nbsp;km (1385 miles.)  They flew by private plane to the Crown Jewel of the Broome Coast, to Eco Beach a beautiful and rugged part of the Kimberley region of north Western Australia.  They arrived to meet with Tim who was seen from the beach, standing on a Catamaran, the Karma IV a 70' luxurious catamaran, waving at them.  Natalie, chose not the join the group as she had a phobia about boats.  Tim, loving his outdoor sport and adventures was keen to see who shared his love of the water.  Penny grabbed an opportunity to rub Tim down with sun screen much to Sarah's annoyance.  Sarah said she 'shuts down' on group dates and remained moody.  Anna stated she was on fire and after jumping in the sea, the current was strong and she started to drift away, so Tim jumped in and went in for the rescue.  He said, it was a smart move on her behalf if it was a ploy to get a bit of 1 on 1 time with him.\n \nOn the speed boat back to the beach, Rochelle spotted Tim caressing Anna's hand on the rail discreetly and made comment that Anna and Tim had a strong bond and that she needs to step it up.\n \nNatalie appeared and joined them but not all the girls were pleased to see her.  \n \nTim then announced he can only take one girl on a date and he chose Penny.  They sat by a campfire and shared wine and conversation, Penny telling Tim about her divorce and how she was looking for love and she told him she was falling in love with him.  Tim didn't feel there was a spark between them and felt conflicted.  He didn't want to lead Penny on.  He felt there was more of a friendship that they shared.\n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\n\"Catch it if you can\" invitation arrived back at the resort and Anna was chosen for a one on one date.  The next morning Tim and Anna headed off on a 4WD driving the expanse of the isolated beach and met with a guide who was going to show them how to catch mud crabs in the mangroves.   Later Tim and Anna ventured on to a picnic on the beach and shared some intimate discussions about their feelings for each other.  Tim was impressed that Anna was not needy for love after she stated that at 26 years old, she's never had a boyfriend.  In a cut away scene he stated he had a huge crush on Anna and loved her playful energy and that he felt, he was falling for Anna after experiencing giddiness and butterflies.  Anna received a rose. \n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nBack at the cocktail party before the Rose Ceremony was to take place, Tim took Sarah aside and she had a small altercation with Tim privately about not feeling comfortable on group dates and hence why she gets reserved and that she felt uncomfortable seeing him with the other girls.  Tim felt worldliness and maturity was stronger with some girls in the group.  Back inside, the mood was mellow as all the girls were feeling insecure about Tim.\n \nTim asked Rochelle to go for a walk and told her he felt he had a connection with her.   The roses were then handed out, to Ali, Sarah, Rochelle, Danielle, Katherine and Natalie.  Penny was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 9===\n'''Original airdate:''' 23 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-9|title= Episode 9 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nAs this episode opened with seven girls remaining, they are still having their week in Broome.  Tim said he is in his head a lot but feels he has to now start thinking with his heart.  The scene opens with the girls swimming in the sea and were called to the beach to read the new invitation, which Katherine read out. Rochelle stated she hadn't had a one-on-one date as yet. Sarah said she was hoping for a second date so they could spend more time with Tim on a one on one.  \n \n'''One-on-one date:'''\nRochelle was chosen for \"Are You Ready to come out of your Shell\" date.  As Tim drove Rochelle along a bumpy bush gravel road towards her surprise, they arrived to see a boat waiting for them to go pearl fishing.  As they were heading for the precise spot along the river, Tim was delighting in seeing different layers emerge from Rochelle during their conversation.   \n \nTim found a shell that he handed to Rochelle who then pulled out a natural pearl which was hers to keep.  Tim and Rochelle headed back to the Resort for champagne in the evening gardens then went for an intimate spa.  \nRochelle received a Rose. \n \n'''Group date:''' \nBack at Cable Beach Club Resort and Spa the girls were having a casual game of tennis when another invitation arrived.  Anna read out the invitation themed 'Fly to Sea - Two from Three'.  Sarah Ali and Dani were invited.  There were gasps all round - someone is going home!  The girls were flown out in a helicopter to the awaiting catamaran 'Great Escape' which had a landing pad on it.  There was much excitement and screaming inside the cabin but the girls felt trepidation as one wasn't coming back.   When they landed and greeted Tim who was awaiting their arrival, they said it felt like they were in a James Bond film.  Dani stated she was glad she was with Ali and Sarah as she didn't care for their feelings and hoped she wasn't going home.\n \nThe date had the girls jumping from a rope that was rigged up to swing them out like a pendulum wherein they had to let go once they were out far enough.  Sarah went first and did a flop, followed by Ali and then Dani.  Ali decided to have another go but once she was out the rope started to spin her wildly and she fell hard on the water, injuring her knee.  After being brought on board by the crew, she was in shock and it was decided to get the helicopter to pick her up to take her to the hospital.  Tim was worried that Ali might not be able to continue in the show.  He said he was upset and felt she was perfect because she was so positive even after the accident and suffering in pain. \n \nSarah and Dani were worried it would be one of them to go home as Tim wouldn't send Ali home under those conditions.  However, the date was abandoned and they returned to the Resort. \n \nNatalie said Sarah needs to grow up before she gets married and be in a relationship (Sarah is 22).\n \nThe girls were chatting waiting for Tim's arrival and were surprised at Sarah's lack of sympathy about Tim taking Ali to the hospital and staying by her side.  \nIt was unknown if Ali would be present at the Rose Ceremony.  Tim said Ali being in hospital had a massive impact on him and all he could think about, was Ali.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nIn the garden, the mood was flat, awaiting news of Ali and which two were being sent home.  Tim walked in and said he felt the tension.  They asked after Ali and he said she was doing well.  \nSuddenly, Ali appeared hobbling on crutches.\n \nTim only had four roses to give out to the remaining six girls and in order, Ali, Anna, Katherine and Dani received the roses.  Natalie and Sarah were eliminated.\n\n===Episode 10===\n'''Original airdate:''' 30 October 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-10|title= Episode 10 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nThis week's episode informs that Tim must choose which four out of the five remaining contestants, he will choose to go on hometown dates with.  \nThe contestants are mingling on the balcony with their morning coffee, an invitation arrives for a 'one on one date' and Katherine was selected for the \"Journey from the Past into the Future\" date.   Dani speculated that it could be a visit to a museum.\n\n'''One-on-one date:'''\nA limo pulled up and we see Tim and Katherine head off to a surprise date.  Tim is concerned about Katherine as she is still quite reserved but he wanted to know if the feelings and great night they previously shared back at his place, could be rekindled.  They finally arrived in the dark of night to a paddock - Tim covers Kath's eyes and walks her to a machine and tells her to pull the lever whereupon a Fun Fair amusement park lit up.  After going on various rides and making fairy floss, they made their way to some hay bales to have champagne and to talk.  Although a rose was tantalizingly sitting beside them, Tim elected not to give Katherine the rose as he didn't want to get swept up on the date and make a rash decision.  Katherine returned to the house with two stuffed animals but no rose, much to the remaining contestant's quiet delight.\n \n'''Group date:''' \nThe group date saw Ali, Danielle, Anna and Rochelle being taken to an Art Gallery to get their interpretation on a few pieces of art. They were then requested to go upstairs to the VIP Gallery for a surprise.  Tim escorted Anna up first where they were met with a display of her childhood memorabilia.  Ali, Dani then Rochelle were escorted up separately with Tim and they each talked about fond moments and memories as presented in the display.\n \n'''Cocktail party:'''\nThe atmosphere was intense as the girls waited for Tim to arrive.  Upon his arrival he decided to take personal time out in the garden for a chat first with Ali, then Katherine and finally Rochelle - wanting to clear a few more questions he had.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nTim gave the first rose to Anna, then Danielle, Ali and finally the 4th rose, to Rochelle.  Katherine was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 11===\n'''Original airdate:''' 6 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-11|title= Episode 11 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \nThis week's episode - Meet the Families.\n  \nFirst stop was Goulburn, Anna's hometown.  Anna was quite nervous as she had never brought a boyfriend home to meet her parents before.  When Tim arrived in town, Anna showed him some of the township and revisited her primary school.  Tim said he felt scared upon learning Anna's dad was a lawyer and being cross-examined.  Anna also told Tim unfortunately her two sisters couldn't be there, as they both lived overseas, however, after coming home and introducing Tim to her mum, there were squeals of joy as her two sisters appeared in a wonderful surprise.   After Anna's father arrived, he gave Tim a bit of a gruelling session, then stated to the camera that he was impressed with Tim and found him personable and genuine.  Tim said he felt very comfortable with the whole family.\n \nNext was a visit to Perth, Western Australia \u2013  to meet Rochelle's parents.  When Tim arrived, Rochelle and he went off for a game of mini-golf and a cold beer at the Waterfront.  Afterwards they headed off home to meet with Rochelle's parents.  During the course of dinner and the evening's conversation, Rochelle went introverted, which had Tim perplexed and it was awkward.  Rochelle again stated she was too scared to open up fully to love.\n \nThird, was a visit to the Gold Coast in sunny Queensland to visit Danielle's mum and sister.  Firstly however, they met and went for a picnic and swim to the Currumbin Rock Pools.  Danielle told Tim she hadn't really informed her mum about going on the show and that her mother only found out with short notice, that Tim was coming over for lunch to meet her.  She felt quite anxious about her mother's reaction as she could be quite 'conservative'.  Dani's mum and Tim had a quiet moment together in the garden and surprisingly enjoyed each other's company in that short time.  This left a good impression and Dani's mum felt more relaxed than at the start of the home visit.  Tim didn't feel the relationship would go any deeper as Dani was still very reserved and had huge walls up.\n \nFinally, over to the Adelaide Hills, in South Australia, to meet Ali's parents and brother.  Tim was excited to see Ali again and stated he loved her radiating energy.  Ali took Tim to a small German township called Hahndorf where they shared one huge hotdog German style and couldn't finish it.  Ali told Tim her parents had never approved of any ex-boyfriends she brought home previously for them to meet and she was very anxious as she wanted their approval.  Ali's dad and Tim went for a chat in the garden and he asked Tim what had happened to Ali's leg when she had the accident in Broome.  Later, Ali's parents had a private chat with her and asked her how she felt about Tim and what would she say if he asked for her hand in marriage.  Ali's dad was happy to see his daughter so taken by Tim and thought they made a really good match. \n \n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nWith four girls left and only 3 roses to give out, Tim was in a dilemma about Rochelle and Danielle - the two home visits that didn't go so well.\nAli received the first rose followed by Anna.  Tim then asked Rochelle to go outside as he still had a few questions to ask her.  After escorting her back inside, he then took Danielle outside for a brief moment.\nThe third rose went to Rochelle and Danielle was eliminated.\n\n===Episode 12===\n'''Original airdate:''' 13 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-bachelor/episode-recaps/episode-12|title= Episode 12 Recap|date=|work=The Bachelor Australia Official Site|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n'''Overnight dates:'''\nWith the final 3 contestants left, Tim first met up with Ali and they went for a drive in a Porsche up to the Blue Mountains countryside and had a small picnic.  Tim stated that if he wasn't dating all 3 girls at once, he could see himself falling for Ali, but, it was difficult as he 'had feelings for all 3 girls'.  That night during dinner at a cabin in the Blue Mountains, Ali declared her love for Tim again.  Tim didn't feel it was fair to say anything back whilst dating 2 other girls stating that he couldn't fully allow himself to feel that (love).  After dinner, sitting by the log fire, he handed an envelope to Ali which had a note and key inside inviting them to stay the night as a couple.  Tim declined saying it wouldn't be fair on the other girls. \n \nNext, we see Tim meeting Rochelle for a cruise on a luxury yacht 'Aqua Bay' on Sydney Harbour.  He felt she still had barriers up and withheld secrets.  Rochelle felt she was falling in love with Tim.  Tim again stated to Rochelle, how important communication between them was to him.  They headed off taking in the stunning and unbelievable Sydney Harbour views, to a secluded beach called Store Beach, for a picnic and swim.   They also thought it would be fun to write a 'message in a bottle' and threw it into the sea.   That evening over a platter of a variety of seafood on board the yacht, Tim said to Rochelle 'I love my time with you and I want to keep continuing this'.  When the desserts arrived, as they were lounging on the back deck, an invitation and key was on the tray offering them to stay the night as a couple, if they wished.  Tim again declined to stay the night.\n\nFinally, Tim met with Anna for their date in the botanic gardens and had a canape and champagne brunch.  Tim reflected on how they banter well, and how being with Anna is easy and fun.  Tim asked Anna outright 'I need to know what you are feeling and more importantly, what you see in me'.  Anna stated the problems in not having boyfriends in the past was probably due to her not being open about her emotions.  She said she wanted to make sure Tim was right for her as well.  Tim said he needed to know that Anna really knew who he was.  Anna replied she would try and be more open but didn't want to fall for Tim 100% due to the possibility of being hurt and not end up being with him.  After dinner, at the Milton Park Country House, Bowral - (125&nbsp;km south of Sydney) they retired to the fireside and read the awaiting invitation letter and key to stay the night.  Tim explained he didn't feel comfortable staying the night with any of the girls due to respect for all the 3 finalists as he had strong feelings for each of them and it just didn't feel right.\n\nPrior to the Rose Ceremony, we see Tim heading into Bunda Jewellers in the city, to ask for help in getting an engagement ring designed, which would express the emotions and feelings he had whilst on this journey and wished for it to be featured in the original design.\n \n'''Rose ceremony:'''\nTwo roses are shown on the tray and with 3 finalists left - Ali, Anna and Rochelle. Prior to entering the Rose Ceremony, Tim was given a recording from each of them, to view, by the Host to assist Tim in his final decision.  The girls awaited separately in the garden, each stating they would be devastated if they didn't get a rose that night.\n\nRochelle received the first rose, followed by Anna and in a shock elimination, Ali was eliminated and left, broken-hearted.\n \nIn the next Episode the final 2 - Anna and Rochelle - travel to Thailand where the final rose will be handed out.  This trip will also see Tim's parents in Thailand wherein Tim's mother will get to meet the final two contestants.\n\n===Episode 13===\n'''Original airdate:''' 20 November 2013\n\nIn the season Finale, Tim's quest for love reaches its dramatic conclusion on the stunning coast of Thailand, staying at the Pullman Phuket Arcadia resort in Phuket.  Tim's family get to meet the final two girls, Anna and Rochelle.\n\n'''Meet Tim's family:'''\nRochelle was the first finalist to be introduced to Tim's family over lunch.  Tim's mum had a private and probing conversation with Rochelle and thought Rochelle hadn't completely let her walls down.\nNext it was Anna's turn to be introduced to the family and they noticed how uplifting her energy was and how Tim couldn't stop smiling.  Tim's sister commented that Tim was being 'himself when he was with Anna'.  Tim's mother also had a private chat with Anna and Anna found some of the questions daunting and intense and discovered she had to admit she was in love with Tim.\n\n'''Final dates:'''\nTim has two final dates - Tim states 'it has gone from who will get the final rose to who will get all of my heart.'\n\nTim's first final date was with Anna - his surprise was a trip on a speed boat to an awaiting traditional Chinese Junk in the middle of Phang Nga Bay.   They jumped off the Junk and swam to shore where they had some alone time.  That evening, they went to a fire twirling dancing show.  After the show, Anna gave Tim a gift box of cards she had drawn up, some 40, which she read out, the many and different reasons she loved him and she finally declared that she was falling madly in love with him.\n\nOn Tim & Rochelle's final date, they met in the jungle and went for an elephant ride to the sea.  That evening, they chatted privately, under the majestical starry night.\n\n'''Final decision:'''\nRochelle was first to walk down the path on the cliffside of the Resort, to hear Tim's final decision. 'There is only one girl I can't live without' Tim declared to the camera.  With Rochelle standing before him,  he told Rochelle his 'heart was leading somewhere else' and Rochelle was not chosen to be the one he had fallen deeply in love with.\n\nWhen Anna walked towards Tim for the final decision and greeted him, he said 'you have my heart and I have fallen deeply and madly in love with you'.   He then pulled out a small gift box which was the ring he had designed which was of two bands of platinum with an infinity loop, symbolizing their journey together and moving forward.  He slipped it onto Anna's middle finger of her right hand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrnes|first=Holly|url=

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

{"title_page": "Harry Weinberg", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n{{COI|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Harry Weinberg''' (1908 \u2013 1990, aged 82) was an American billionaire businessman who founded ''The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc.'', a private charitable foundation, with over $2 billion in assets in 2018 and headquartered in [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]], [[Maryland]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The foundation is named for Mr. Weinberg and his wife of 58 years, Jeanette Gutman Weinberg (1909 \u2013 1989, aged 80).  \n\n==Beginnings== \nWeinberg was born on August 15, 1908, in the city of Sambor (now called \"Sambir\") , then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father Joseph Weinberg came to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the United States on November 17, 1911, on the S.S. Breslau. He sent for his family some months later, and his family (Sarah and their four children) arrived in August, 1912, on the S.S. K\u00f6ln. Sambor became part of Poland after World War I and then part of Ukraine after World War II.  \n\nHarry Weinberg was the second of seven children, born between 1906 and 1922, of Joseph and Sarah Weinberg (both born in 1881). The children's names, by order of birth, were Henry, Harry, Betty, William, David, Nathan, and Sidney. Two other children were born but died early, one in 1918 during that year's Influenza Epidemic. David, Nathan, and Sidney were born in the United States, and the other four were born in Sambor. The family lived in Southwest Baltimore City, on 2028 Eagle Street (about four years after arrival), and then a block away on Wilkens Avenue. Sarah Weinberg, a homemaker, died of cancer in 1935 at age 54. Joseph Weinberg, primarily a metal worker who operated a body-and-fender repair business, died of stroke in 1961 at age 80.\n\n== Early years in business ==\nWhen World War I ended in 1918, the ten-year-old Weinberg took advantage of the celebrations by selling small American flags on the street, until the celebrations died down. He either finished, or dropped out of, the sixth grade in a Baltimore public school. Thereafter, he worked in the body-and-fender business of his father, until as a teenager of 16-18, he emancipated himself and moved to Philadelphia to work for a tire retreading company (used tires), which he ultimately purchased from its owner. By 1928, he moved back to Baltimore to start his own used tire business there. At first, he sold used tires from the street, but quickly established credit and opened his Camden Tire Company in a storefront in the 400 block of West Camden Street in 1929. A bit later, he moved his business to a storefront at 211 South Paca Street, a better location. He learned the basic skills about running a retail business -- how to keep books, read a balance sheet, and maximize profits in limited square footage.  \n\nHis business was across the street from a saddlery, located at 501 West Pratt Street (corner of Paca and Pratt) owned by Morris and Herman Gutman, who befriended Weinberg. Weinberg met Morris Gutman's older daughter, Jeanette, and later married her on March 22, 1931, at a local Reform Jewish synagogue of which the Gutmans were members. Harry and Jeanette Weinberg had their only child, Morton Weinberg, in December 1933.  \n\nIn 1936, Weinberg sold his interest in Camden Tire Company to his brother, William (aka \"Willie\"). Harry already had begun to purchase real estate and stocks as investments. After the Great Depression began in late 1929, real estate and stocks could be purchased at relatively low prices. His first commercial property investment was on Hanover Street in Baltimore City. He continued to purchase commercial real estate in Baltimore, obtaining loans often from his father-in-law. Weinberg, his wife Jeanette, and baby Morton moved to 3110 Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore City. By the end of 1936, Weinberg's total annual real estate-related income was about $9,200 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $162,000), on assets of $63,700 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $1.1 million). In addition, he had additional assets in stock holdings.  \n\nIn 1938, he began to manifest philanthropic interest, when he pledged his own stock holdings to help sponsor several of his wife's relatives so they could emigrate from Germany to the United States and avoid Nazi persecution and the genocide of Jews and others that was soon to follow. When the United States declared war on Japan and Germany in late 1941, Weinberg already was 33. He was declared '4F' -- ineligible for service in the armed forces -- because of an inoperable hernia. However, the Weinberg family provided four men to serve in the United States military -- William (Navy), David (Army), Nathan (Army), and Sidney (Navy) -- and all four returned after the war uninjured.  \n\nIn 1939, Weinberg obtained ownership of the New Joyce Hotel, across from Camden Station in Baltimore. The hotel quickly became a popular stop for soldiers and support personnel moving between various military training camps on the Eastern Seaboard during the war. Weinberg hired his older brother, Henry Weinberg, to manage the hotel bar, which was bustling with activity during the war. Weinberg sold the hotel in the late 1950s (the hotel no longer exists, replaced by a portion of the parking lot serving Orioles Park at Camden Yards and the adjacent Hilton Hotel).    \n\nWeinberg's next major investment was to purchase a controlling interest in Baltimore Brickyards (\"BB\"), a local publicly held corporation that owned numerous small brick manufacturers and vacant land in Baltimore. This purchase came about after BB refused to consider his offer to purchase just one abandoned brickyard owned by BB. An acquaintance of his who owned stock in BB confided to Weinberg that the family that dominated the BB board of directors had told the other directors that the company should not sell to a Jew. Outraged, Weinberg commenced a highly motivated and detailed study of the company. That study revealed that BB was asset-rich but earnings-poor, and was a prime takeover target. The company's books listed its various property-holding values at book value (original cost of the land), but not at the much higher current market value; the books made the company appear to be worth less than market value. Yet, BB's publicly traded stock was severely depressed and could be purchased on the open market for below $1 per share. He quietly began to buy as many outstanding shares of BB as possible. After he obtained a 40 % ownership interest by purchasing all the outstanding shares available on the public market, he purchased another 10+ % of the outstanding shares of BB (at double the then-current market price) from a local financial institution that held those shares in trust accounts for some of its clients. Weinberg now had ownership of a majority of BB's stock. When promptly thereafter, he entered BB's offices and announced his intention to take over operating control of the firm, a buy-out of Weinberg's stock interest was negotiated by BB's directors; BB transferred to him the parcel he originally wanted, plus many other land parcels in exchange for his stock. He resisted anti-semitism and made a profit doing so.  \n\n== Transit empire ==\nAt various points in his business career in the 1950s and 1960s, Weinberg owned controlling interests in four mass-transit bus companies -- Scranton, Pennsylvania; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas, Texas; and New York City. In the first three cities, Weinberg ensured that the bus companies' extensive holdings of real estate unrelated to their transit operations were spun-off into separate corporations not subject to public utility regulations. When later each company's bus operations were purchased by its city through actual or threatened eminent domain proceedings, Weinberg, at least, retained ownership of the unrelated real estate. To tell the full story would take volumes, so provided here is only a relatively superficial summary of his transit holdings.  \n\nHe was introduced to the mass-transit world in 1948, when the Baltimore Transit Company (\"'''BTC'''\") sold inexpensive ''second''-mortgage bonds backed by BTC's real estate and other assets. Once again, he saw that the difference between those assets' \"book value\" (original cost) and their current fair market value presented him with an arbitrage opportunity to earn a substantial return. Knowing that BTC's real estate was worth far more than reported on BTC financial statements, Weinberg was confident in the repayment of the bonds.    \n\nHis faith in real estate paid off when BTC returned to solvency, paying off much of its debt through the sale of some of BTC's valuable real estate not needed for its transit operations. Weinberg earned a large profit when the second-mortgage bonds were repaid to him. In the process, he learned a wealth of knowledge about the operations of mass transit bus companies and their \"hidden\" real estate assets.    \n\n=== Scranton Transit Company (\"STC\") ===\nIn 1953, Weinberg began investing in the Scranton Transit Company, starting with its bonds. Weinberg researched STC's financial situation and discovered that the market value of STC's real estate and other assets was substantial, notwithstanding low book values. He slowly and steadily purchased more and more of the STC bonds, typically at bargain prices, from the various bondholders. By 1954, now owning a large share of STC's debt, he joined STC's board of directors, which resisted his efforts to reform the company's operations for the benefit of its investors. A transit strike by the unionized employees of STC crippled the company and hurt Scrantonians reliant on bus service. STC missed two straight bond interest payments. Weinberg, as the principal bondholder, forced STC into Pennsylvania state court receivership. Bondholders had first priority over other investors. The state court awarded him control of the reorganization of STC. Weinberg took over control of the company, and through a series of prudent business moves -- including cutting inefficient service, working with the union to keep wages steady, and the like -- brought the company back to financial health. The company returned to private management out of receivership, with Weinberg installed as chief executive officer and chairman of the reborn STC.  \n\nWeinberg made other investments while working on the STC matter; he invested in real estate and the stocks of other companies. He began buying small businesses in the Scranton area. He created diverse holding companies to manage his various properties. One of these holding companies was Scranton Corporation, which, among other things, operated the Scranton Lace Company (''e.g.,'' transparent rubber-coated lace tablecloths) and held controlling interests in the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and Storm Vulcan (a metal-stamping manufacturer) in Dallas, Texas. Weinberg eventually made Scranton one of his three hometowns, at least for eight years (Baltimore and Hawaii being the others), renting a large apartment there.  \n\nIn the latter 1960s, Weinberg sold STC to the City of Scranton, but Weinberg companies retained ownership of former STC real estate holdings, unrelated to transit needs, that had been spun off into separate companies.\n\n===Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (\"HRT\") ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Weinberg quietly began to purchase shares of HRT stock through a local friend. By 1958, he had acquired about ten percent of the outstanding shares of the company and was its largest single shareholder. Most of HRT's assets were in real estate holdings. HRT's financial statements listed only the various properties' book values (original cost), and many of those book values reflected the much lower costs of the 1890s. All non-transportation-related real estate was owned by HRT's wholly owned subsidiary, '''Honolulu Limited''', created in 1954, which became HRT's investment company in 1959.        \n\nAfter a hard-fought battle to obtain a seat on HRT's board of directors, and his purchase of even more of HRT's stock, a Weinberg proxy (the same friend) was elected to the HRT board in 1957. By the end of 1958, Weinberg owned nearly 35 % of HRT's stock. In February, 1959, Weinberg obtained a seat on the board of land-rich Honolulu Limited. By July, 1959, Weinberg also won a board seat on HRT -- the \"parent\" bus company. He gained influence on the Honolulu Limited board as a result of astute business recommendations that were followed by that board. Honolulu Limited, at Weinberg's urging, used some available corporate cash to purchase a 32 % interest in the Dallas Transit Company, a bus company of which Weinberg also had been buying stock separately. Also, at Weinberg's recommendation, HRT's assets were reduced to those reasonably necessary to operate the public bus business and public bus routes, and most other assets unrelated to that purpose were transferred to Honolulu Limited for investment purposes.        \n\nIn March, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Boards of HRT and Honolulu Limited. As board members retired or rotated off these boards, Weinberg's associates joined these boards. By March, 1961, Weinberg owned 60 % of HRT stock and eventually would own 95 % of the stock. By the end of his complete takeover of these corporations, he earned the moniker \"Honolulu Harry,\" in the press. It was a moniker by which he would be known by some for the rest of his life.            \n\nEventually, the HRT bus business was purchased by the City & County of Honolulu. As in Scranton, Weinberg and his companies retained ownership of Honolulu Limited and its properties. In addition, Weinberg and his companies independently had been purchasing real estate (mostly commercial) in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island of Hawaii, and this process continued throughout Weinberg's life.          \n\n===Dallas Transit Company (\"DTC\") ===\nWeinberg's move into Dallas was very similar in principle to that in Hawaii. The combination of Honolulu Limited's and his own ownership of DTC stock amounted to about 44 % of DTC's outstanding common stock. In January, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Board of DTC. He relocated three of his brothers -- Nathan, David, and Sidney to Dallas to become full-time executive employees and officers of the company. Soon thereafter, Nathan became president and chief operating officer, David became corporate treasurer, and Sidney became corporate secretary. DTC created a wholly owned subsidiary, Dal-Trans Service Co. (\"'''Dal-Tran'''\"), that was free from regulation by the Dallas Public Utility Commission (\"'''PUC'''\"). DTC began gradually transferring all non-utility assets of DTC into Dal-Tran.  \n\nHe found other inefficiencies in the operation of DTC, most notably that in the pre-Weinberg era, many of DTC's non-union employees had procured their jobs as political favors. These non-productive political types were fired. DTC ordered service reductions on many unprofitable lines, comprising about seven percent of the system's bus mileage. To avoid union strikes in June 1960 over demand for higher wages, he negotiated with union leaders by tying wage hikes to fare increases; if the city would grant the fare increase, then the employees would get a wage increase. When the PUC denied the fare increase request, he avoided a strike by offering smaller but temporary wage increases. By this point, Weinberg controlled 78 % of DTC stock.  \n\nDuring the period of Weinberg's control of DTC, the bus company hired African-American bus drivers for the first time ever in Dallas. This decision, announced by Nathan Weinberg, DTC President, in May 1963 was the subject of front-page news articles, editorial comments, and letters-to-the-editor, largely derogatory. As the ridership was heavily black, Harry and his brothers felt that diversity among the drivers should be a given.  \n\nBy 1964, however, the City of Dallas came to the conclusion that it was impracticable for a private company to operate the mass transit bus lines in the city. This conclusion was typical of those of other cities in the U.S.; to make the buses serve all the people, they would have to be subsidized heavily and managed by the municipality. By the Fall of 1964, the City of Dallas purchased DTC for $5.5 million. DTC was represented by Robert Strauss, later to become a major national figure in law and politics (including chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Jimmy Carter years). He continued to control Dal-Tran.   \n\n===New York City's Fifth Avenue Coach Company (\"FACC\") ===\nBy the Spring of 1961, Weinberg also held ''non''-controlling interests in transit operations in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; Richmond and Roanoke, Virginia; Akron, Ohio; Springfield, Illinois; and Baltimore, Maryland. But the biggest system was in New York City, and Fifth Avenue Coach Company was the largest privately held mass transit bus company in the nation. FACC also had highly valuable real estate assets, most of which were not necessary to the bus operation, and the FACC financial statements listed the properties' value based on \"book value\" -- the original cost of the properties -- not their very substantial fair market value. Weinberg started to purchase shares in the stock of FACC perhaps as early as 1956, but the Dal-Tran purchases of FACC stock brought Weinberg's share of FACC to about 25 % by May 1961; he (including companies he controlled) was the largest single stockholder. On February 14, 1962, with FACC suffering financial stresses and outright deficits from a variety of sources, Weinberg was granted five of the fifteen FACC board seats and was elected Chairman of the Board.                                                                                  \n\nWeinberg set out to restore FACC to financial health. His plan was to obtain a basic fare increase and to reinstate the five-cent transfer (which had been eliminated before he took control), as the company was running a large operational deficit. New York Mayor, Robert Wagner, however resisted with all his might. In addition, the transit workers union called an illegal strike in March 1962 (illegal, as a one-year contract had been entered into in January with the previous management). In New York, unlike in Scranton, Honolulu, and Dallas, New York residents had viable alternatives to buses -- the subway and walking -- and they started using the alternatives. FACC announced plans to eliminate \"all unprofitable night and Sunday service and lay off 1,500 workers,\" although far fewer actually were affected. The union resisted, and the buses remained out of service.                                                                                  \n\nMayor Wagner quickly persuaded Governor Nelson Rockefeller to get a bill passed in the State legislature to begin condemnation proceedings to take over the facilities and operations of FACC. The bill was passed and was signed by Rockefeller on March 22, 1962. Mayor Wagner had the New York Transit Authority operate the FACC lines. Thereafter, an arbitration proceeding determined the amount of compensation shareholders, including Weinberg and his companies, would receive for the taking. Weinberg did not end up with ownership of any New York real estate, as there had not been enough time (only a month of control) to spin off the non-utility real estate into a separate company. Thereafter, Weinberg had no further investments in New York businesses, other than using New York stockbrokers for his securities purchases and sales.                                                                                  \n\n== Real estate empire ==\nBy the time of his passing in late 1990, Weinberg and his companies owned huge real estate holdings in the State of Hawaii, with lesser holdings in Baltimore, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dyersburg, Tennessee; and a sprinkling of small holdings in some other states. By then, he was the largest individual landowner in Hawaii. He undertook an intense study of the major landowning companies in Hawaii and discovered what he already suspected -- that the true value of their real estate holdings was multiples higher than the 19th Century book values reported in their financial statements. He steadily purchased publicly traded stock in these companies, hoping to eventually earn a seat on their respective boards and push their business strategies toward a more profit-conscious goal beneficial to shareholders. A recitation of details here would be voluminous and so will be avoided. Suffice it to say that these companies included American Factors (AmFac), Dillingham Corporation, Maui Land & Pineapple, and Alexander & Baldwin (A&B). In each case, he would acquire substantial stock holdings; the incumbent board would resist (ultimately unsuccessfully) his efforts to gain board seats; he would argue at board and shareholder meetings for a more profit-aggressive, shareholder-friendly business strategy that would require sale or development of raw land (thus, realizing market value); and the companies would trade some of their real estate holdings to Weinberg in exchange for his stock holdings (with a contractual promise from him not to purchase their stock for a few years).  One could call this process \"greenmail\" (a benign takeoff on a similar phrase with a different color and a negative denotation). In the process, Weinberg came to own massive amounts of real estate in Hawaii. He held a non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' at the time of his death.\n\n== Other holdings ==\nAlthough he owned real estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the majority of Weinberg's assets was in securities. He was a highly focused securities investor who made his own decisions. Wherever he happened to be at the moment -- including Hawaii, which was in a time zone 5-6 hours earlier than that of the East Coast -- he would call his stockbroker each weekday morning at 9:00 Eastern Time to give him orders to buy and/or sell. He enjoyed reading financial statements and other materials about publicly traded companies, and had a knack for figuring out the hidden value in each. In many cases, that hidden value was real estate. In addition, he owned a few metal stamping factories -- in Dallas, Texas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Dyersburg, Tennessee. Each of these factory operations was sold within five years of his death.\n\n== Personal life ==\nWeinberg married Jeanette Gutman on March 22, 1931. They were both Jewish, attending a Reform Jewish synagogue from time-to-time. Jeanette died in August 1989 at age 80. They were married for 58 years. They had one child, Morton Weinberg, born in December 1933, who died of cancer and complications therefrom in October 2012 at age 79. Morton and his first wife, Joanie (married 1962), had four children \u2013 a girl and three boys. In order of birth, the grandchildren are Catherine, George, John, and Peter. Catherine has two children, Anthony and Chad. Harry and Jeanette had many nieces and nephews.\n\nHarry and Jeanette Weinberg had homes, at various times, in Baltimore, Scranton, and on two Hawaiian islands (Oahu and Kauai). Mr. Weinberg had no hobbies, although he did enjoy watching westerns on television in his free time and loved looking out at the beauty of Hawaii. His political orientation was moderate overall; he was not committed to any party and generally voted for the candidates he thought would be best for the economy and the country. \n\nWeinberg developed multiple myeloma in the early 1980s, and although he was in remission after cancer treatment, he required regular blood transfusions for the remainder of his life. Weinberg died on November 4, 1990, in Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 82. He and his wife are buried in Baltimore, Maryland, at the same cemetery as are his parents and Jeanette's Gutman's parents. Other than a modest bequest to his four grandchildren, he left all his assets to charity. Everything except for his non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was added to the assets in his foundation (see below). The stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was left to ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'', a support foundation of ''The Associated: Jewish Community Foundation of Baltimore'', which uses distributions primarily to assist the lower-income Jewish individuals in the Baltimore area. That stock interest later was sold by ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'' to Steve Case, AOL founder (or a corporate entity controlled by him).  \n\n== The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation ==\nThe Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc. was created on June 8, 1959, as a Maryland nonprofit private foundation. At some point after its creation, Weinberg decided to dedicate his fortune to his foundation. The best source for information about the Weinberg Foundation is its website: [http://www.weinbergfoundation.org www.weinbergfoundation.org]. In general, the Weinberg Foundation makes grants ''to public charities'' that provide direct services to people in the lower half of the economic spectrum, especially poor individuals. Grants in 2018 are made primarily to charities in the U.S. and Israel. Both Jewish and non-Jewish individuals benefit from the grants made to the various charities by the foundation. The foundation is managed by a five-member Board of Trustees, a non-Trustee President-CEO, and a support staff in Baltimore and Honolulu.                                                                                      \n* \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weinberg, Harry}}\n[[Category:Foundations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Jewish American philanthropists]]\n[[Category:American real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n{{COI|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Harry Weinberg''' (1908 \u2013 1990, aged 82) was an American billionaire businessman who founded ''The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc.'', a private charitable foundation, with over $2 billion in assets in 2018 and headquartered in [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]], [[Maryland]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The foundation is named for Mr. Weinberg and his wife of 58 years, Jeanette Gutman Weinberg (1909 \u2013 1989, aged 80).  \n\n==Beginnings== \nWeinberg was born on August 15, 1908, in the city of Sambor (now called \"Sambir\") , then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father Joseph Weinberg came to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the United States on November 17, 1911, on the S.S. Breslau. He sent for his family some months later, and his family (Sarah and their four children) arrived in August, 1912, on the S.S. K\u00f6ln. Sambor became part of Poland after World War I and then part of Ukraine after World War II.  \n\nHenry Weinberg was the second of seven children, born between 1906 and 1922, of Joseph and Sarah Weinberg (both born in 1881). The children's names, by order of birth, were Henry, Harry, Betty, William, David, Nathan, and Sidney. Two other children were born but died early, one in 1918 during that year's Influenza Epidemic. David, Nathan, and Sidney were born in the United States, and the other four were born in Sambor. The family lived in Southwest Baltimore City, on 2028 Eagle Street (about four years after arrival), and then a block away on Wilkens Avenue. Sarah Weinberg, a homemaker, died of cancer in 1935 at age 54. Joseph Weinberg, primarily a metal worker who operated a body-and-fender repair business, died of stroke in 1961 at age 80.\n\n== Early years in business ==\nWhen World War I ended in 1918, the ten-year-old Weinberg took advantage of the celebrations by selling small American flags on the street, until the celebrations died down. He either finished, or dropped out of, the sixth grade in a Baltimore public school. Thereafter, he worked in the body-and-fender business of his father, until as a teenager of 16-18, he emancipated himself and moved to Philadelphia to work for a tire retreading company (used tires), which he ultimately purchased from its owner. By 1928, he moved back to Baltimore to start his own used tire business there. At first, he sold used tires from the street, but quickly established credit and opened his Camden Tire Company in a storefront in the 400 block of West Camden Street in 1929. A bit later, he moved his business to a storefront at 211 South Paca Street, a better location. He learned the basic skills about running a retail business -- how to keep books, read a balance sheet, and maximize profits in limited square footage.  \n\nHis business was across the street from a saddlery, located at 501 West Pratt Street (corner of Paca and Pratt) owned by Morris and Herman Gutman, who befriended Weinberg. Weinberg met Morris Gutman's older daughter, Jeanette, and later married her on March 22, 1931, at a local Reform Jewish synagogue of which the Gutmans were members. Harry and Jeanette Weinberg had their only child, Morton Weinberg, in December 1933.  \n\nIn 1936, Weinberg sold his interest in Camden Tire Company to his brother, William (aka \"Willie\"). Harry already had begun to purchase real estate and stocks as investments. After the Great Depression began in late 1929, real estate and stocks could be purchased at relatively low prices. His first commercial property investment was on Hanover Street in Baltimore City. He continued to purchase commercial real estate in Baltimore, obtaining loans often from his father-in-law. Weinberg, his wife Jeanette, and baby Morton moved to 3110 Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore City. By the end of 1936, Weinberg's total annual real estate-related income was about $9,200 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $162,000), on assets of $63,700 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $1.1 million). In addition, he had additional assets in stock holdings.  \n\nIn 1938, he began to manifest philanthropic interest, when he pledged his own stock holdings to help sponsor several of his wife's relatives so they could emigrate from Germany to the United States and avoid Nazi persecution and the genocide of Jews and others that was soon to follow. When the United States declared war on Japan and Germany in late 1941, Weinberg already was 33. He was declared '4F' -- ineligible for service in the armed forces -- because of an inoperable hernia. However, the Weinberg family provided four men to serve in the United States military -- William (Navy), David (Army), Nathan (Army), and Sidney (Navy) -- and all four returned after the war uninjured.  \n\nIn 1939, Weinberg obtained ownership of the New Joyce Hotel, across from Camden Station in Baltimore. The hotel quickly became a popular stop for soldiers and support personnel moving between various military training camps on the Eastern Seaboard during the war. Weinberg hired his older brother, Henry Weinberg, to manage the hotel bar, which was bustling with activity during the war. Weinberg sold the hotel in the late 1950s (the hotel no longer exists, replaced by a portion of the parking lot serving Orioles Park at Camden Yards and the adjacent Hilton Hotel).    \n\nWeinberg's next major investment was to purchase a controlling interest in Baltimore Brickyards (\"BB\"), a local publicly held corporation that owned numerous small brick manufacturers and vacant land in Baltimore. This purchase came about after BB refused to consider his offer to purchase just one abandoned brickyard owned by BB. An acquaintance of his who owned stock in BB confided to Weinberg that the family that dominated the BB board of directors had told the other directors that the company should not sell to a Jew. Outraged, Weinberg commenced a highly motivated and detailed study of the company. That study revealed that BB was asset-rich but earnings-poor, and was a prime takeover target. The company's books listed its various property-holding values at book value (original cost of the land), but not at the much higher current market value; the books made the company appear to be worth less than market value. Yet, BB's publicly traded stock was severely depressed and could be purchased on the open market for below $1 per share. He quietly began to buy as many outstanding shares of BB as possible. After he obtained a 40 % ownership interest by purchasing all the outstanding shares available on the public market, he purchased another 10+ % of the outstanding shares of BB (at double the then-current market price) from a local financial institution that held those shares in trust accounts for some of its clients. Weinberg now had ownership of a majority of BB's stock. When promptly thereafter, he entered BB's offices and announced his intention to take over operating control of the firm, a buy-out of Weinberg's stock interest was negotiated by BB's directors; BB transferred to him the parcel he originally wanted, plus many other land parcels in exchange for his stock. He resisted anti-semitism and made a profit doing so.  \n\n== Transit empire ==\nAt various points in his business career in the 1950s and 1960s, Weinberg owned controlling interests in four mass-transit bus companies -- Scranton, Pennsylvania; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas, Texas; and New York City. In the first three cities, Weinberg ensured that the bus companies' extensive holdings of real estate unrelated to their transit operations were spun-off into separate corporations not subject to public utility regulations. When later each company's bus operations were purchased by its city through actual or threatened eminent domain proceedings, Weinberg, at least, retained ownership of the unrelated real estate. To tell the full story would take volumes, so provided here is only a relatively superficial summary of his transit holdings.  \n\nHe was introduced to the mass-transit world in 1948, when the Baltimore Transit Company (\"'''BTC'''\") sold inexpensive ''second''-mortgage bonds backed by BTC's real estate and other assets. Once again, he saw that the difference between those assets' \"book value\" (original cost) and their current fair market value presented him with an arbitrage opportunity to earn a substantial return. Knowing that BTC's real estate was worth far more than reported on BTC financial statements, Weinberg was confident in the repayment of the bonds.    \n\nHis faith in real estate paid off when BTC returned to solvency, paying off much of its debt through the sale of some of BTC's valuable real estate not needed for its transit operations. Weinberg earned a large profit when the second-mortgage bonds were repaid to him. In the process, he learned a wealth of knowledge about the operations of mass transit bus companies and their \"hidden\" real estate assets.    \n\n=== Scranton Transit Company (\"STC\") ===\nIn 1953, Weinberg began investing in the Scranton Transit Company, starting with its bonds. Weinberg researched STC's financial situation and discovered that the market value of STC's real estate and other assets was substantial, notwithstanding low book values. He slowly and steadily purchased more and more of the STC bonds, typically at bargain prices, from the various bondholders. By 1954, now owning a large share of STC's debt, he joined STC's board of directors, which resisted his efforts to reform the company's operations for the benefit of its investors. A transit strike by the unionized employees of STC crippled the company and hurt Scrantonians reliant on bus service. STC missed two straight bond interest payments. Weinberg, as the principal bondholder, forced STC into Pennsylvania state court receivership. Bondholders had first priority over other investors. The state court awarded him control of the reorganization of STC. Weinberg took over control of the company, and through a series of prudent business moves -- including cutting inefficient service, working with the union to keep wages steady, and the like -- brought the company back to financial health. The company returned to private management out of receivership, with Weinberg installed as chief executive officer and chairman of the reborn STC.  \n\nWeinberg made other investments while working on the STC matter; he invested in real estate and the stocks of other companies. He began buying small businesses in the Scranton area. He created diverse holding companies to manage his various properties. One of these holding companies was Scranton Corporation, which, among other things, operated the Scranton Lace Company (''e.g.,'' transparent rubber-coated lace tablecloths) and held controlling interests in the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and Storm Vulcan (a metal-stamping manufacturer) in Dallas, Texas. Weinberg eventually made Scranton one of his three hometowns, at least for eight years (Baltimore and Hawaii being the others), renting a large apartment there.  \n\nIn the latter 1960s, Weinberg sold STC to the City of Scranton, but Weinberg companies retained ownership of former STC real estate holdings, unrelated to transit needs, that had been spun off into separate companies.\n\n===Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (\"HRT\") ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Weinberg quietly began to purchase shares of HRT stock through a local friend. By 1958, he had acquired about ten percent of the outstanding shares of the company and was its largest single shareholder. Most of HRT's assets were in real estate holdings. HRT's financial statements listed only the various properties' book values (original cost), and many of those book values reflected the much lower costs of the 1890s. All non-transportation-related real estate was owned by HRT's wholly owned subsidiary, '''Honolulu Limited''', created in 1954, which became HRT's investment company in 1959.        \n\nAfter a hard-fought battle to obtain a seat on HRT's board of directors, and his purchase of even more of HRT's stock, a Weinberg proxy (the same friend) was elected to the HRT board in 1957. By the end of 1958, Weinberg owned nearly 35 % of HRT's stock. In February, 1959, Weinberg obtained a seat on the board of land-rich Honolulu Limited. By July, 1959, Weinberg also won a board seat on HRT -- the \"parent\" bus company. He gained influence on the Honolulu Limited board as a result of astute business recommendations that were followed by that board. Honolulu Limited, at Weinberg's urging, used some available corporate cash to purchase a 32 % interest in the Dallas Transit Company, a bus company of which Weinberg also had been buying stock separately. Also, at Weinberg's recommendation, HRT's assets were reduced to those reasonably necessary to operate the public bus business and public bus routes, and most other assets unrelated to that purpose were transferred to Honolulu Limited for investment purposes.        \n\nIn March, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Boards of HRT and Honolulu Limited. As board members retired or rotated off these boards, Weinberg's associates joined these boards. By March, 1961, Weinberg owned 60 % of HRT stock and eventually would own 95 % of the stock. By the end of his complete takeover of these corporations, he earned the moniker \"Honolulu Harry,\" in the press. It was a moniker by which he would be known by some for the rest of his life.            \n\nEventually, the HRT bus business was purchased by the City & County of Honolulu. As in Scranton, Weinberg and his companies retained ownership of Honolulu Limited and its properties. In addition, Weinberg and his companies independently had been purchasing real estate (mostly commercial) in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island of Hawaii, and this process continued throughout Weinberg's life.          \n\n===Dallas Transit Company (\"DTC\") ===\nWeinberg's move into Dallas was very similar in principle to that in Hawaii. The combination of Honolulu Limited's and his own ownership of DTC stock amounted to about 44 % of DTC's outstanding common stock. In January, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Board of DTC. He relocated three of his brothers -- Nathan, David, and Sidney to Dallas to become full-time executive employees and officers of the company. Soon thereafter, Nathan became president and chief operating officer, David became corporate treasurer, and Sidney became corporate secretary. DTC created a wholly owned subsidiary, Dal-Trans Service Co. (\"'''Dal-Tran'''\"), that was free from regulation by the Dallas Public Utility Commission (\"'''PUC'''\"). DTC began gradually transferring all non-utility assets of DTC into Dal-Tran.  \n\nHe found other inefficiencies in the operation of DTC, most notably that in the pre-Weinberg era, many of DTC's non-union employees had procured their jobs as political favors. These non-productive political types were fired. DTC ordered service reductions on many unprofitable lines, comprising about seven percent of the system's bus mileage. To avoid union strikes in June 1960 over demand for higher wages, he negotiated with union leaders by tying wage hikes to fare increases; if the city would grant the fare increase, then the employees would get a wage increase. When the PUC denied the fare increase request, he avoided a strike by offering smaller but temporary wage increases. By this point, Weinberg controlled 78 % of DTC stock.  \n\nDuring the period of Weinberg's control of DTC, the bus company hired African-American bus drivers for the first time ever in Dallas. This decision, announced by Nathan Weinberg, DTC President, in May 1963 was the subject of front-page news articles, editorial comments, and letters-to-the-editor, largely derogatory. As the ridership was heavily black, Harry and his brothers felt that diversity among the drivers should be a given.  \n\nBy 1964, however, the City of Dallas came to the conclusion that it was impracticable for a private company to operate the mass transit bus lines in the city. This conclusion was typical of those of other cities in the U.S.; to make the buses serve all the people, they would have to be subsidized heavily and managed by the municipality. By the Fall of 1964, the City of Dallas purchased DTC for $5.5 million. DTC was represented by Robert Strauss, later to become a major national figure in law and politics (including chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Jimmy Carter years). He continued to control Dal-Tran.   \n\n===New York City's Fifth Avenue Coach Company (\"FACC\") ===\nBy the Spring of 1961, Weinberg also held ''non''-controlling interests in transit operations in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; Richmond and Roanoke, Virginia; Akron, Ohio; Springfield, Illinois; and Baltimore, Maryland. But the biggest system was in New York City, and Fifth Avenue Coach Company was the largest privately held mass transit bus company in the nation. FACC also had highly valuable real estate assets, most of which were not necessary to the bus operation, and the FACC financial statements listed the properties' value based on \"book value\" -- the original cost of the properties -- not their very substantial fair market value.

Suffice it to say that these companies included American Factors (AmFac), Dillingham Corporation, Maui Land & Pineapple, and Alexander & Baldwin (A&B). In each case, he would acquire substantial stock holdings; the incumbent board would resist (ultimately unsuccessfully) his efforts to gain board seats; he would argue at board and shareholder meetings for a more profit-aggressive, shareholder-friendly business strategy that would require sale or development of raw land (thus, realizing market value); and the companies would trade some of their real estate holdings to Weinberg in exchange for his stock holdings (with a contractual promise from him not to purchase their stock for a few years).  One could call this process \"greenmail\" (a benign takeoff on a similar phrase with a different color and a negative denotation). In the process, Weinberg came to own massive amounts of real estate in Hawaii. He held a non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' at the time of his death.\n\n== Other holdings ==\nAlthough he owned real estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the majority of Weinberg's assets was in securities. He was a highly focused securities investor who made his own decisions. Wherever he happened to be at the moment -- including Hawaii, which was in a time zone 5-6 hours earlier than that of the East Coast -- he would call his stockbroker each weekday morning at 9:00 Eastern Time to give him orders to buy and/or sell. He enjoyed reading financial statements and other materials about publicly traded companies, and had a knack for figuring out the hidden value in each. In many cases, that hidden value was real estate. In addition, he owned a few metal stamping factories -- in Dallas, Texas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Dyersburg, Tennessee. Each of these factory operations was sold within five years of his death.\n\n== Personal life ==\nWeinberg married Jeanette Gutman on March 22, 1931. They were both Jewish, attending a Reform Jewish synagogue from time-to-time. Jeanette died in August 1989 at age 80. They were married for 58 years. They had one child, Morton Weinberg, born in December 1933, who died of cancer and complications therefrom in October 2012 at age 79. Morton and his first wife, Joanie (married 1962), had four children \u2013 a girl and three boys. In order of birth, the grandchildren are Catherine, George, John, and Peter. Catherine has two children, Anthony and Chad. Harry and Jeanette had many nieces and nephews.\n\nHarry and Jeanette Weinberg had homes, at various times, in Baltimore, Scranton, and on two Hawaiian islands (Oahu and Kauai). Mr. Weinberg had no hobbies, although he did enjoy watching westerns on television in his free time and loved looking out at the beauty of Hawaii. His political orientation was moderate overall; he was not committed to any party and generally voted for the candidates he thought would be best for the economy and the country. \n\nWeinberg developed multiple myeloma in the early 1980s, and although he was in remission after cancer treatment, he required regular blood transfusions for the remainder of his life. Weinberg died on November 4, 1990, in Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 82. He and his wife are buried in Baltimore, Maryland, at the same cemetery as are his parents and Jeanette's Gutman's parents. Other than a modest bequest to his four grandchildren, he left all his assets to charity. Everything except for his non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was added to the assets in his foundation (see below). The stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was left to ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'', a support foundation of ''The Associated: Jewish Community Foundation of Baltimore'', which uses distributions primarily to assist the lower-income Jewish individuals in the Baltimore area. That stock interest later was sold by ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'' to Steve Case, AOL founder (or a corporate entity controlled by him).  \n\n== The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation ==\nThe Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc. was created on June 8, 1959, as a Maryland nonprofit private foundation. At some point after its creation, Weinberg decided to dedicate his fortune to his foundation. The best source for information about the Weinberg Foundation is its website: [http://www.weinbergfoundation.org www.weinbergfoundation.org]. In general, the Weinberg Foundation makes grants ''to public charities'' that provide direct services to people in the lower half of the economic spectrum, especially poor individuals. Grants in 2018 are made primarily to charities in the U.S. and Israel. Both Jewish and non-Jewish individuals benefit from the grants made to the various charities by the foundation. The foundation is managed by a five-member Board of Trustees, a non-Trustee President-CEO, and a support staff in Baltimore and Honolulu.                                                                                      \n* \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weinberg, Harry}}\n[[Category:Foundations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Jewish American philanthropists]]\n[[Category:American real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma]]\n", "name_user": "Gschadow", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBeginnings:oops Harry, not Henry.
