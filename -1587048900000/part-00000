(''Qu'Est-ce Que le Spiritisme'' in French) is a brief introduction to [[Spiritism]] written by [[Allan Kardec]] in 1859, which is about a quarter of the length of [[The Spirits Book]]. Modern editions are augmented by a brief [[biography]] of the author, written by [[Henri Sausse]], in 1896 which is mostly focused on his role in the [[History of Spiritism]].\n\nThe book is structured as a series of [[:wikt:conference|conference]]s about Spiritism, intended to quench the public curiosity and dismiss false notions about the doctrine. It is not intended as an initiation and is not seen by Spiritists as strictly canonical but it is very important to understand Kardec's own motivations and commitment to the cause of Spiritism, as the book was entirely penned by himself, without ''spiritual help''. Its central subjects are the following.\n\n==Criticism of Spiritism==\nKardec tries to address the most common theses argued against [[Spiritism]] regarding it as a form of [[charlatan]]ism. He counters the critics with the following:\n\n* Spiritism is not a religion and is not interested on [[proselitism|proselitising]].\n* Spiritism is not for everyone, only for those who are ready to accept it.\n* Spiritism will survive religion because it is not based on blind faith.\n* Spiritism does not extort money from followers, everything is taught for free.\n* Charges of [[charlatan]]ism will not affect Spiritism because charlatans are moved by selfishness and usually want to make a stash, so they expose themselves by their own deeds.

They are not vain [[neologism]]s.\n* The existing of offshoot Spiritist groups is not undesirable, but a consequence of the spreading of the doctrine. Kardec does not claim any form of leadership, except on moral grounds (as the author of the books that first established Spiritism as a coherent doctrine), and does not expect Spiritism to survive him as \"Kardecism\".

The character and the series, a sequel to ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', were created by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]]. Lin's mother, [[Toph Beifong]], greatly aided the previous avatar, [[Aang]], in his efforts to save the Earth Kingdom from destruction. Lin is the older of Toph's two offspring.\n\n==Character overview==\nLin Beifong is the chief of Police of Republic City and the daughter of Toph Beifong, who once held the same position. Like her mother, Lin is able to both manipulate the classical element of earth, which is known as earthbending and its sub-ability to manipulate metal, which is termed metalbending. Like Toph, Lin also has the ability to sense movements around her through [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]. She learned these techniques under the hard tutelage of her mother. Despite the fact that her mother was friends with the previous Avatar, Lin initially was decidedly antagonistic towards [[Korra|Avatar Korra]], at one time interrogating the lead character.<ref name=\"Welcome to Republic City\">{{cite episode|title= Welcome to Republic City|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=101|airdate=2012-04-14|season=1|number=1|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=101|transcript=Transcript for 101 \u2013 Welcome to Republic City|credits=Director: Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko |series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> However, throughout the course of the series\u2019 run she warmed up to Korra.\n\nLin has a longstanding friendship with [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], who is a son of Aang and [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]].

She interrogated the Avatar and when Tenzin arrived, Lin agreed to drop the charges against Korra, though made it clear that she wanted the Avatar \"out of [her] city\".<ref name=\"Welcome to Republic City\"/> Lin initially held a grudge against Tenzin over their breakup several years earlier, but agreed to \u201cbury the hatchet\u201d in their effort to secure a sporting event from a terrorist group, the Equalists. Despite maximum-level security, the Equalists were able to disrupt the event, overwhelming the police forces. Lin, with the help of Korra, was able to repel the terrorist group, though they were unable to capture the organization's leader, Amon.<ref name=\"And The Winner Is\u2026\">{{cite episode|title= And The Winner Is\u2026|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=106|airdate=2012-05-19|season=1|number=6|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=106|transcript=Transcript for 106 \u2013 And The Winner Is\u2026|credits=Director:Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Korra had earned Lin's respect and trust in the process. After the Equalist attack, Lin received negative press for failing to capture Amon. Lin would lead an investigation that uncovered that industrialist Hiroshi Sato, [[Asami Sato|Asami Sato's]] father, involvement with the Equalists.  In an ensuing battle pitting Lin, Korra, Tenzin and members of the police force against the terrorist organization, a number of police officers were captured by the Equalists. The trio was able to avoid capture, but Lin elected to tender her resignation.

Shortly, the Equalists invaded the island, incapacitating Lin in the process. Ironically, Lin was rescued by three of Tenzin's kids, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo, who easily defeated the invaders. Upon Tenzin's return to the island, noticing that more Equalist airships were heading to Republic City Tenzin decided to take his family and flee Republic City on Tenzin's sky bison, Oogi. Lin accompanied the family. However, when it became apparent that Oogi would not outpace the airships, Lin made the decision to abandon Oogi and attack the fleet in midair in an effort to ensure the family's escape. In an impressive display of midair metalbending, Lin single-handedly destroyed a number of airships before she was captured by the terrorist organization, allowing Tenzin and his family to at least temporarily escape capture.

However Lin's presence was detected and Suyin, matriarch of Zaofu, met Lin on the ship. Suyin revealed to Team Avatar that she was Lin's sister, upon which Lin reminded her that she was her half-sister. Suyin shared that Lin's niece, Opal, was the airbender. At an ensuing dinner, Lin made a number of snide remarks to many of Suyin statements. Before the argument escalated they were interrupted by Varrick, who was out of prison and resided in Zaofu. Later that night, Opal and Korra visited Lin in her room. In an attempt to reconcile the two sisters, Opal shared with Lin that she wanted her to be a part of the family. Lin responded with a cold \"get out\". Opal ran out of the room in tears. In response to Lin's behavior, Korra angrily told Lin that the police chief would always be a lonely and bitter woman before storming out of the room.

During the ensuing sessions, which involved reaching into her buried memories, she revisited her checkered past with Suyin. Lin flashed back to her attempt to arrest Suyin and her subsequent scarring accidentally caused by Suyin. Upon awakening from her final session, she disregarded the doctor's suggestion to rest, deciding instead to confront Suyin. An enraged Lin started yet another argument with Suyin. The argument quickly escalated and when Suyin told Lin that she was a bitter, selfish woman and that Tenzin was right to leave her, Lin attacked, setting off a full-blown fracas between the siblings. When an angry Opal finally broke up the fight, demanding to know why two sisters would want to hurt each other, Lin passed out from exhaustion, sleeping for the next sixteen hours. Upon waking up, Lin was well-rested and was in a substantially more positive mood. She apologized to Opal for her behavior, explaining she was not comfortable speaking about personal matters. She advised Opal to train with the other airbenders away from home, which Opal ultimately did.

During the battle she and Suyin fought P'Li, a formidable foe and combustion-bender. P\u2019li had the rare ability to generate fire from her forehead, causing explosions. Lin relayed to her sister that when she drew P'Li's fire, Suyin was to incapacitate her. Suyin objected, but Lin told her sibling she loved her before unilaterally initiating the plan. The police chief was hit by a blast from P\u2019Li, nearly falling over a cliff. In one of the series\u2019 more graphic moments, as P\u2019Li was preparing to knock Lin off the cliff with a blast, Suyin quickly metalbent her plate of armor around the combustion bender's head. This caused P'Li's explosion to blow up in her face, instantly killing her.

However, she did make one excursion outside the city, to save Suyin and many members of her family, who were imprisoned by the Earth Kingdom dictator, Kuvira. When the world leaders decided to not attack Kuvira, Lin immediately sought out Opal.

After Bolin, through his stint as a soldier of Kuvira's army, was able to inform them the location of the nearest \u201creeducation camp\u201d, the quartet left for the camp on Juicy. During dinner, Lin made a number of sarcastic comments towards her mother. When Bolin asked Toph who Lin's father was, her mother casually answered that it was a man named Kanto, who she characterized as a \u201cnice man\u201d. Sensing her daughter's \"enraged breathing\" Toph told Lin to say whatever was on her mind. Lin angrily replied that growing up without a father and never seeing or even discussing him was unacceptable to her. Lin declared that after the rescue, she wanted nothing to do with her mother. Toph solemnly stated that if that made Lin happy, she would accept her decision. The four would eventually successfully free Suyin and all the incarcerated members of her family. They would also rescue Varrick's longtime assistant Zhu Li. Lin and her mother would eventually reconcile with the latter stating that she was proud of both her and Suyin. Subsequently, Zhu Li informed Lin that Kuvira planned to invade Republic City in two weeks.<ref name=\"Operation Beifong\">{{cite episode|title= Operation Beifong|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=410|airdate= 2014-12-05 |season=4|number=10|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=410| transcript=Transcript for 410 \u2013 Operation Beifong|credits=Director: Melchior Zwyer; Writer: Tim Hedrick|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Lin played a large role in the battle of Republic City.

Once inside, Lin and Suyin inflicted major damage. They rendered the suit's primary weapon, a large cannon mounted on its right arm, useless. When Kuvira ripped the now functionless arm off and violently tossed it away, Lin and Suyin were trapped in the appendage. The two were knocked unconscious by the resulting impact with the ground but would later regain consciousness. When Kuvira finally surrendered, Lin arrested the despot and led her away.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements. Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewer David Levesley called Lin one of the series' \"standout characters\" and one of the show's \"many examples of well-written women\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/01/game-of-thrones-withdrawal-watch-nickelodeon-s-fantasy-epic-the-legend-of-korra.html|title=\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Withdrawal?

The character and the series, a sequel to ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', were created by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]]. Lin's mother, [[Toph Beifong]], greatly aided the previous avatar, [[Aang]], in his efforts to save the Earth Kingdom from destruction. Lin is the older of Toph's two offspring.\n\n==Character overview==\nLin Beifong is the chief of Police of Republic City and the daughter of Toph Beifong, who once held the same position. Like her mother, Lin is able to both manipulate the classical element of earth, which is known as earthbending and its sub-ability to manipulate metal, which is termed metalbending. Like Toph, Lin also has the ability to sense movements around her through [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]. She learned these techniques under the hard tutelage of her mother. Despite the fact that her mother was friends with the previous Avatar, Lin initially was decidedly antagonistic towards [[Korra|Avatar Korra]], at one time interrogating the lead character.<ref name=\"Welcome to Republic City\">{{cite episode|title= Welcome to Republic City|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=101|airdate=2012-04-14|season=1|number=1|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=101|transcript=Transcript for 101 \u2013 Welcome to Republic City|credits=Director: Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko |series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> However, throughout the course of the series\u2019 run she warmed up to Korra.\n\nLin has a longstanding friendship with [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], who is a son of Aang and [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]].

Unlike Toph however, Lin can also be characterized as bitter, which primarily stemmed from her strained relationship with both her mother and her half-sister, Suyin Beifong. In the latter half of the series run, Lin reconciled with the two characters, becoming less resentful as the series progressed.\n\n== Creation and conception ==\n[[File:Mindy Sterling by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Mindy Sterling]] voices Lin Beifong.]]\n\nWhile her mother was known during announcements for the series and established at the start of the series, the identity of her father was not revealed initially.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/38633/20130822/legend-of-korra-book-2-3.htm|title=Legend Of Korra Book 3 To Focus On Lin Bei Fong: Fans Theorize On The Father|date=August 22, 2013|publisher=KpopStarz}}</ref> Lin Beifong's character design was inspired by Han Young Ja, a longtime friend and colleague of Konietzko and DiMartino.<ref>{{cite web|last=Konietzko|first=Bryan|author1-link=Bryan Konietzko|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/21800949227/han-young-ja-our-longtime-friend-and-colleague|title=Han Young Ja|work=Co-Creator's Blog|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> Elements of her design also came from [[Marlene Dietrich]] as the creators wanted her \"to have a tough and natural beauty\" and her appearance was collaborated on by both [[Joaquim Dos Santos]] and series co-creator Michael DiMartino which DiMartino found to be \"a fun process.\"<ref name=DiMartino22-23>{{cite book|first=Michael Dante|last=DiMartino|title=''The Legend of Korra\u2014The Art of the Animated Series, Book One: Air''|pages=23|year=2013|isbn=978-1616551681|publisher=Dark Horse Books}}</ref>\n\n== Appearances ==\n===''The Legend of Korra''===\n====''Book One: Air''====\nLin spent the vast majority of Season One in Republic City.

She interrogated the Avatar and when Tenzin arrived, Lin agreed to drop the charges against Korra, though made it clear that she wanted the Avatar \"out of [her] city\".<ref name=\"Welcome to Republic City\"/> Lin initially held a grudge against Tenzin over their breakup several years earlier, but agreed to \u201cbury the hatchet\u201d in their effort to secure a sporting event from a terrorist group, the Equalists. Despite maximum-level security, the Equalists were able to disrupt the event, overwhelming the police forces. Lin, with the help of Korra, was able to repel the terrorist group, though they were unable to capture the organization's leader, Amon.<ref name=\"And The Winner Is\u2026\">{{cite episode|title= And The Winner Is\u2026|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=106|airdate=2012-05-19|season=1|number=6|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=106|transcript=Transcript for 106 \u2013 And The Winner Is\u2026|credits=Director:Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Korra had earned Lin's respect and trust in the process. After the Equalist attack, Lin received negative press for failing to capture Amon. Lin would lead an investigation that uncovered that industrialist Hiroshi Sato, [[Asami Sato|Asami Sato's]] father, involvement with the Equalists.  In an ensuing battle pitting Lin, Korra, Tenzin and members of the police force against the terrorist organization, a number of police officers were captured by the Equalists. The trio was able to avoid capture, but Lin elected to tender her resignation. When Tenzin encouraged her to not give up, Lin shared that she intended to capture Amon \u201coutside of the law\u201d.<ref name=\"The Aftermath\">{{cite episode|title= The Aftermath|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=107|airdate=2012-05-19|season=1|number=7|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=107|transcript=Transcript for 107 \u2013 The Aftermath |credits=Director:Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Later, with Tenzin needing to attend a council meeting, Lin watched over Tenzin's wife and children on Air Temple Island. Shortly, the Equalists invaded the island, incapacitating Lin in the process. Ironically, Lin was rescued by three of Tenzin's kids, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo, who easily defeated the invaders. Upon Tenzin's return to the island, noticing that more Equalist airships were heading to Republic City Tenzin decided to take his family and flee Republic City on Tenzin's sky bison, Oogi. Lin accompanied the family. However, when it became apparent that Oogi would not outpace the airships, Lin made the decision to abandon Oogi and attack the fleet in midair in an effort to ensure the family's escape. In an impressive display of midair metalbending, Lin single-handedly destroyed a number of airships before she was captured by the terrorist organization, allowing Tenzin and his family to at least temporarily escape capture. Lin would lose her bending at the hands of Amon, who had the ability to take away bending, but would have it later restored by Korra.<ref name=\"Turning the Tides\">{{cite episode|title= Turning the Tides |url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=110|airdate= 2012-06-16 |season=1|number=10|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=110|transcript=Transcript for 110 \u2013 Turning the Tides|credits=Director:Joaquim Dos Santos, Ki Hyun Ryu; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-legend-of-korra-newbie-recap-turning-the-tides/|title=The Legend of Korra Newbie Recap: \"Turning the Tides\"|first=Rebecca|last=Pahle|publisher=The Mary Sue|date=July 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====''Book Two: Spirits''====\nIn Season Two, Lin returned to Republic City, reinstated as Chief of Police.

When Korra and Mako initially broke up (over issues related to the bombing) at the city police station, Lin, finding an overturned table, demanded to know what happened.

When Varrick, who bankrolled the motion picture, was outed as the mastermind of not only the attempted kidnapping of President Raiko at the event, but also the bombing of the cultural center, Lin promptly arrested him and freed Mako.

However Lin's presence was detected and Suyin, matriarch of Zaofu, met Lin on the ship. Suyin revealed to Team Avatar that she was Lin's sister, upon which Lin reminded her that she was her half-sister. Suyin shared that Lin's niece, Opal, was the airbender. At an ensuing dinner, Lin made a number of snide remarks to many of Suyin statements. Before the argument escalated they were interrupted by Varrick, who was out of prison and resided in Zaofu. Later that night, Opal and Korra visited Lin in her room. In an attempt to reconcile the two sisters, Opal shared with Lin that she wanted her to be a part of the family. Lin responded with a cold \"get out\". Opal ran out of the room in tears. In response to Lin's behavior, Korra angrily told Lin that the police chief would always be a lonely and bitter woman before storming out of the room.

During the ensuing sessions, which involved reaching into her buried memories, she revisited her checkered past with Suyin. Lin flashed back to her attempt to arrest Suyin and her subsequent scarring accidentally caused by Suyin. Upon awakening from her final session, she disregarded the doctor's suggestion to rest, deciding instead to confront Suyin. An enraged Lin started yet another argument with Suyin. The argument quickly escalated and when Suyin told Lin that she was a bitter, selfish woman and that Tenzin was right to leave her, Lin attacked, setting off a full-blown fracas between the siblings. When an angry Opal finally broke up the fight, demanding to know why two sisters would want to hurt each other, Lin passed out from exhaustion, sleeping for the next sixteen hours. Upon waking up, Lin was well-rested and was in a substantially more positive mood. She apologized to Opal for her behavior, explaining she was not comfortable speaking about personal matters. She advised Opal to train with the other airbenders away from home, which Opal ultimately did. Lin also reconciled with Suyin.<ref name=\"Old Wounds\">{{cite episode|title= Old Wounds|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=306|airdate=2014-07-18|season=3|number=6|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=306| transcript=Transcript for 306 \u2013 Old Wounds|credits=Director:Ian Graham; Writer:Katie Mattila|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Later, Lin would be involved in a large-scale clash with the Red Lotus, an anarchist group. During the battle she and Suyin fought P'Li, a formidable foe and combustion-bender. P\u2019li had the rare ability to generate fire from her forehead, causing explosions. Lin relayed to her sister that when she drew P'Li's fire, Suyin was to incapacitate her. Suyin objected, but Lin told her sibling she loved her before unilaterally initiating the plan. The police chief was hit by a blast from P\u2019Li, nearly falling over a cliff. In one of the series\u2019 more graphic moments, as P\u2019Li was preparing to knock Lin off the cliff with a blast, Suyin quickly metalbent her plate of armor around the combustion bender's head. This caused P'Li's explosion to blow up in her face, instantly killing her.

However, she did make one excursion outside the city, to save Suyin and many members of her family, who were imprisoned by the Earth Kingdom dictator, Kuvira. When the world leaders decided to not attack Kuvira, Lin immediately sought out Opal. Eventually the two allowed Bolin to join their mission, flying on Opal's sky bison, Juicy.<ref name=\"Beyond the Wilds\">{{cite episode|title= Beyond the Wilds|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=409|airdate= 2014-11-28 |season=4|number=9|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=409| transcript=Transcript for 409 \u2013 Beyond the Wilds|credits=Director:Ian Graham; Writer: Joshua Hamilton|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Once the trio arrived at Zaofu, they encountered Toph, whom Lin addressed as \"chief\". After Bolin, through his stint as a soldier of Kuvira's army, was able to inform them the location of the nearest \u201creeducation camp\u201d, the quartet left for the camp on Juicy. During dinner, Lin made a number of sarcastic comments towards her mother. When Bolin asked Toph who Lin's father was, her mother casually answered that it was a man named Kanto, who she characterized as a \u201cnice man\u201d. Sensing her daughter's \"enraged breathing\" Toph told Lin to say whatever was on her mind. Lin angrily replied that growing up without a father and never seeing or even discussing him was unacceptable to her. Lin declared that after the rescue, she wanted nothing to do with her mother. Toph solemnly stated that if that made Lin happy, she would accept her decision. The four would eventually successfully free Suyin and all the incarcerated members of her family. They would also rescue Varrick's longtime assistant Zhu Li. Lin and her mother would eventually reconcile with the latter stating that she was proud of both her and Suyin. Subsequently, Zhu Li informed Lin that Kuvira planned to invade Republic City in two weeks.<ref name=\"Operation Beifong\">{{cite episode|title= Operation Beifong|url=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=410|airdate= 2014-12-05 |season=4|number=10|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=410| transcript=Transcript for 410 \u2013 Operation Beifong|credits=Director: Melchior Zwyer; Writer: Tim Hedrick|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink= The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Lin played a large role in the battle of Republic City.

Once inside, Lin and Suyin inflicted major damage. They rendered the suit's primary weapon, a large cannon mounted on its right arm, useless.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements. Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewer David Levesley called Lin one of the series' \"standout characters\" and one of the show's \"many examples of well-written women\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/01/game-of-thrones-withdrawal-watch-nickelodeon-s-fantasy-epic-the-legend-of-korra.html|title=\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Withdrawal?

While she genuinely wishes to help her people, Kuvira is shown or implied to have committed a number of tyrannical actions for the sake of her goal; she refuses to help impoverished states unless they provide her with large amounts of natural resources, uses her citizens as slave labour, imprisons dissenters and people of non-Earth Kingdom descent in concentration camps, and conscripts people into her armed forces. She later seizes power for herself, on the basis that the Earth Kingdom's monarchy led to the previous decline of the Earth Kingdom, and has the nation rechristened as the Earth Empire. Following the coronation of Prince Wu, at which Kuvira announces her intentions to rule the nation herself, Kuvira moves to take control of Zaofu, intending to use the city state's wealth and technology for the sake of her empire. At the same time, she attempts to have Varrick develop weapons powered with spirit vine energy. These actions, along with Kuvira's refusal to tolerate disagreement with her, lead to Bolin and Varrick defecting from her side. While laying siege to Zaofu after negotiations with Suyin fail, Kuvira meets up with Korra, who attempts to convince her to leave Zaofu in peace. Kuvira refuses, asking why she should treat Zaofu any different than her other states, and instead persuades Korra to try and convince Suyin to surrender, pointing out that both women (Korra and Kuvira) have had to make unpopular decisions in the past.\n\n[[File:Zelda Williams.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Zelda Williams]] voices Kuvira]]\n\nThat night, Suyin and her sons Wei and Wing unsuccessfully attempt to assassinate Kuvira, who subsequently demands Zaofu's unconditional surrender. Korra refuses to hand over the city state, and the two women agree to fight for the sake of Zaofu. Initially Kuvira has the advantage, Korra having been out of practice for three years following her poisoning, but after Korra taps into the Avatar State, Kuvira is immediately overwhelmed, and nearly killed by the Avatar. She survives when Korra has a PTSD-influenced hallucination that forces her out of the Avatar State, and Kuvira attempts to kill her, only to be stopped by Jinora and Opal Beifong. Kuvira tries to have her army capture the trio, but they are foiled by the appearance of Meelo and Ikki, Jinora's siblings. Korra and the airbenders escape, while Kuvira takes control of Zaofu, imprisoning the rest of the Beifong family when they refuse to kneel before her. Later on, Kuvira attempts to have Wu, who has been residing in Republic City following the coronation, kidnapped and brought to her, for the implied purpose of executing him. The attempt is foiled by Korra, Asami Sato, and Mako. She also has her army start harvesting the spirit vines in the Foggy Swamp, with Bataar Jr. taking over the spirit vine weapon project following Varrick's escape. This ultimately bears fruit in the form of a large cannon that fires destructive beams of spiritual energy. Attempting to carry out a demonstration of the cannon's power, Kuvira discovers that Zhu Li, who had returned to her side following Varrick's initial attempt to defect, has been sabotaging the weapon to prevent its completion. At the same time as the demonstration, Bolin, Opal, Lin Beifong and Toph rescue the rest of the Beifong family, and later save Zhu Li, returning to Republic City.\n\nWith the escape of her prisoners and the completion of her weapon, Kuvira intends to conquer the United Republic, believing the land to have been stolen from the Earth Kingdom by Aang and Zuko following the Hundred Year War. To this end she travels to Republic City in a gigantic mecha suit known as The Colossus, which has the spirit vine weapon mounted on one arm, in order to force the United Republic to surrender. In response, Korra and her allies kidnap Bataar Jr, with the Avatar threatening to forever keep the two apart from each other unless Kuvira leaves Republic City. Very reluctantly, Kuvira fires the weapon at the place where Bataar Jr is being held, intending to kill Korra and her friends. They all survive, Kuvira's actions lead Bataar Jr to defect against her as well.<ref>''Legend of Korra'', episode 50</ref> Korra and her allies decide to bring down The Colossus, and in the ensuing battle, the mecha is destroyed and Kuvira is injured. Refusing to surrender, Kuvira flees into the spirit wilds and finds the spirit vine weapon, which had been thrown there during the battle. She fires the still functional cannon at Korra, but the weapon starts drawing on the energy in the nearby spirit vines and goes out of control, throwing Kuvira off. Just before the weapon's beam can hit her, Korra saves her by using energybending to stop the beam, inadvertently creating a new spirit portal.\n\nBoth Kuvira and Korra are blasted into the spirit world by the weapon. When Kuvira asks why Korra saved her life after everything that happened, the Avatar explains that she sees a lot of herself in Kuvira; both are fierce and determined to succeed, and sometimes don't think about the consequences of their actions. As Korra calls Kuvira out for her actions, Kuvira explains that after being abandoned by her parents, she could not bear to allow the same thing to happen to the Earth Kingdom. Sympathizing with Kuvira, Korra relates Kuvira's desire for control to her own following her poisoning and subsequent recovery. The two women then return to the physical world, with Kuvira agreeing to surrender, out of both gratitude to Korra and acknowledgement of the Avatar's power. As she is led away by Lin and Suyin, she apologises to the latter for her previous actions.<ref>''Legend of Korra'', episode 52</ref>\n\n== Conception and creation ==\nFor the main antagonist of the fourth season of ''The Legend of Korra'', DiMartino and Konietzko wanted a female antagonist since the previous three (Amon, Unalaq and [[Zaheer]]) were all male.

All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan.

''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only.

It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles.

Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2013 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2013 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages. (\"Ti\" in Lalung (Tiwa) language, \"Twi\" in Tripuri language, \"Dwi\" in 8th scheduled Boro & \"Chi\" in Garo). There are many places name given by Bodo-Kachari people are Dispur, Dinajpur, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Hajo, Mongoldoi, Diphu etc.\n\n==Groups==\nBased on an 1881 census, there were 19 groups within the Kachari\nclassification:\n#[[Boro Tribe|Boro]]\n#[[Chutia people|Chutiya]]\n#[[Dhimal]]\n#[[Garo people|Garo]]\n#[[Hajong people|Hajong]]\n#[[Koch people|Koch]]\n#[[Lalung]] (Tiwa)\n# Mech\n#\tMoran\n#       Modahi\n#\tPhulgaria\n#[[Deuri people|Deuri]]\n#\t[[Rabha tribe|Rabha]]\n#\t[[Sonowal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Sarania kachari]]\n#\tSolaimiya\n#       [[Thengal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Tripuri people|Tiprasa]] \u2013 [[Bru Tribe |Bru]]([[Reang]]), Jamatia, Uchai, Noatia(Tripura), Debbarma, Murasing, Roaza, etc.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Sarania consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus. Other groups, such as the Garo, Rabha, Lalung (Tiwa) and Hajong having been isolated from the parental stock, have established separate identities. With the exception of the Garo, which is still a matrilineal society, the other groups have given up the rules of matrilineal society.\n\nThe Mech in Western Assam, the Boro in central Assam; the Dimasa in Dima Hasao district formerly North Cachar Hills, Nagaon district, Cachar district & Nagaland state and the Sonowal and Thengal in the eastern part of the Brahmaputra now represents the Kachari.\n\n==History==\nThe [[History of Tripura|Tripuri]], [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Koch dynasty|Koch-Mech]] and [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari]] had established powerful kingdoms in the past. The Tripuri kings had even defeated the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s and the [[Burma|Burmese]] kingdoms in the past. Today, the Bodos, the Tripuris, and the Garos have established a strong political and ethnic identity and are developing their language and literature. The Sonowal Kachari is also a branch of greater Kachari. They live in the districts of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Jorhat.\n\n===State formations of the Bodo-Kachari people===\nBodo-Kachari unitedly lived in [[Kamarupa|Kamarupa kingdom]] but Power struggle separated into many parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html|title=Royal history of Cooch Behar|website=coochbehar.nic.in|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> {{Further|Koch dynasty|Chutiya Kingdom|Dimasa kingdom|Twipra Kingdom}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Jacquesson|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=2008|title=Discovering Boro-Garo|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ebhr/pdf/EBHR_32_02.pdf|journal=History of an Analytical and Descriptive Linguistic Category|volume=|pages=|via=}}\n* {{Citation |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lC6FCZ9VcaAC&pg=PA73|last= Sharma |first=Chandan Kumar |contribution=Oral discourse and Bodo identity construction|editor-last=Muthukumaraswamy |editor-first=M.D. |title= Folklore as Discourse |pages=73\u201394|publisher=National folklore support centre|year=2006|isbn= 9788190148160 }}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=PhD|first=Uttam|last=Bathari|title=Memory History and polity a study of dimasa identity in colonial past and post colonial present|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2014|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/115353}}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=PhD|first=Nirjay Kumar|last=Brahma|title=\tSocio political institutions in bodo society|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2008|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/66535}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burling|first=Robbins|pages=|chapter=The Tibeto-Burman Languages of Northeastern India|editor-last=LaPolla|editor-first=Randy J.|location=|author-link=Randy LaPolla|title=Sino-Tibetan languages|year=2013|isbn=|publisher=Routledge|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYJFPZ34ihMC&lpg=PA3&pg=PT146#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Choudhury|first=Sujit|authorlink=|title=The Bodos: Emergence and Assertion of an ethnic minority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2YMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2007|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Study|location=Shimla|isbn=9788179860540|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Endle|first=Sidney|authorlink=|title=The Kacharis|url=https://archive.org/details/kacharis009491mbp|accessdate=20 February 2013|year=1911|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Basu|first1=Analabha|year=2003|title=Ethnic India: A Genomic View, With Special Reference to Peopling and Structure|journal=Genome Research|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2277\u20132290|doi=10.1101/gr.1413403|pmid=14525929|pmc=403703}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=George|first1=Sudhir Jacob|year=1994|title=The Bodo Movement in Assam: Unrest to Accord|url=|journal=Asian Survey|publisher=University of California Press|pages=878\u2013892|volume=34|number=10|doi=10.1525/as.1994.34.10.00p0431w}}\n*{{Linguistic Survey of India|3|2}}\n* {{cite conference|ref=harv|via=|last=Mosahary|first=R N|authorlink=|title=The Boros : Their Origin, Migration and Settlement in Assam|book-title=Proceedings of Northeast India History Association|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701071648/http://dspace.nehu.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/11330/The%20boros%20(RN%20Mosahary).pdf|conference=|accessdate=2019-06-30|year=1983|publisher=Northeast India History Association|location=Barapani|isbn=|volume=|page=|pages=42\u201370}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Narjinari|first=Hira Charan|authorlink=|title=Reassertiveness of the Great Bodos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1RuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|pages=|ref=eighth|last=GoI|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|title=Eighth Scheduled Indian Languages|url=http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf|access-date=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010536/http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf#|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4ba1AAAAIAAJ|title=The place of Assam in the history and civilisation of India |last=Chatterjee |first=S.K.|publisher= Guwahati University |year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv\n  | last = Chatterji\n  | first = S.

Barafisa translated as Children of the Bara.\n\n===Mech===\n{{main|Mech people}}\nThe Mech are found in both Assam and Bengal. Hodgson(1847) wrote as \"Mech is name imposed by strangers.

The Buroks formed a major part of the tribe. The Chutias who were thought to be healthy and strong was termed as Burok and took up the administrative and military roles in the Chutia kingdom. All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan. Even the Motok king [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]] belonged to the Burok Chutia clan.<ref>[http://atributetosankaradeva.org/mayamara.pdf Nath, D. ''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only. There is mention of Manik Chandra Barua, Dhela Bora, Borhuloi Barua as commanders of Chutia army. Later the Ahoms adopted the title after the downfall of Chutias.<ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \"Bora\" was said to be derived from the \"Buruk\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard...</ref><ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora.</ref>\n\n===Moran===\nThe Morans called their leader/chief as Bodousa (great son) where 'sa' means child or son in Moran language . The origin folklore of the Morans is same as that of Boruk Chutias which indicate that they were a faction which split at an early time.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Moran chief Badaucha]</ref> They were also known as Habungiya or earth-folk or autochthones which means son of soil<ref>{{Harvcol|Endle|1911|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Deori===\nThe Deoris (who were priests by profession) also have the Burok clan among them.\n\n===Twipuri===\nThe Tripuris often call themselves Boroks and their language is called Kokborok.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Tripuris are called Boroks]</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThey were first classified by S. Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2013 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2013 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages. (\"Ti\" in Lalung (Tiwa) language, \"Twi\" in Tripuri language, \"Dwi\" in 8th scheduled Boro & \"Chi\" in Garo). There are many places name given by Bodo-Kachari people are Dispur, Dinajpur, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Hajo, Mongoldoi, Diphu etc.\n\n==Groups==\nBased on an 1881 census, there were 19 groups within the Kachari\nclassification:\n#[[Boro Tribe|Boro]]\n#[[Chutia people|Chutiya]]\n#[[Dhimal]]\n#[[Garo people|Garo]]\n#[[Hajong people|Hajong]]\n#[[Koch people|Koch]]\n#[[Lalung]] (Tiwa)\n# Mech\n#\tMoran\n#       Modahi\n#\tPhulgaria\n#[[Deuri people|Deuri]]\n#\t[[Rabha tribe|Rabha]]\n#\t[[Sonowal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Sarania kachari]]\n#\tSolaimiya\n#       [[Thengal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Tripuri people|Tiprasa]] \u2013 [[Bru Tribe |Bru]]([[Reang]]), Jamatia, Uchai, Noatia(Tripura), Debbarma, Murasing, Roaza, etc.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Sarania consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus. Other groups, such as the Garo, Rabha, Lalung (Tiwa) and Hajong having been isolated from the parental stock, have established separate identities. With the exception of the Garo, which is still a matrilineal society, the other groups have given up the rules of matrilineal society.\n\nThe Mech in Western Assam, the Boro in central Assam; the Dimasa in Dima Hasao district formerly North Cachar Hills, Nagaon district, Cachar district & Nagaland state and the Sonowal and Thengal in the eastern part of the Brahmaputra now represents the Kachari.\n\n==History==\nThe [[History of Tripura|Tripuri]], [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Koch dynasty|Koch-Mech]] and [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari]] had established powerful kingdoms in the past. The Tripuri kings had even defeated the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s and the [[Burma|Burmese]] kingdoms in the past. Today, the Bodos, the Tripuris, and the Garos have established a strong political and ethnic identity and are developing their language and literature. The Sonowal Kachari is also a branch of greater Kachari. They live in the districts of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Jorhat.\n\n===State formations of the Bodo-Kachari people===\nBodo-Kachari unitedly lived in [[Kamarupa|Kamarupa kingdom]] but Power struggle separated into many parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html|title=Royal history of Cooch Behar|website=coochbehar.nic.in|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> {{Further|Koch dynasty|Chutiya Kingdom|Dimasa kingdom|Twipra Kingdom}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Jacquesson|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=2008|title=Discovering Boro-Garo|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ebhr/pdf/EBHR_32_02.pdf|journal=History of an Analytical and Descriptive Linguistic Category|volume=|pages=|via=}}\n* {{Citation |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lC6FCZ9VcaAC&pg=PA73|last= Sharma |first=Chandan Kumar |contribution=Oral discourse and Bodo identity construction|editor-last=Muthukumaraswamy |editor-first=M.D. |title= Folklore as Discourse |pages=73\u201394|publisher=National folklore support centre|year=2006|isbn= 9788190148160 }}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=PhD|first=Uttam|last=Bathari|title=Memory History and polity a study of dimasa identity in colonial past and post colonial present|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2014|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/115353}}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=PhD|first=Nirjay Kumar|last=Brahma|title=\tSocio political institutions in bodo society|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2008|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/66535}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burling|first=Robbins|pages=|chapter=The Tibeto-Burman Languages of Northeastern India|editor-last=LaPolla|editor-first=Randy J.|location=|author-link=Randy LaPolla|title=Sino-Tibetan languages|year=2013|isbn=|publisher=Routledge|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYJFPZ34ihMC&lpg=PA3&pg=PT146#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Choudhury|first=Sujit|authorlink=|title=The Bodos: Emergence and Assertion of an ethnic minority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2YMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2007|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Study|location=Shimla|isbn=9788179860540|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Endle|first=Sidney|authorlink=|title=The Kacharis|url=https://archive.org/details/kacharis009491mbp|accessdate=20 February 2013|year=1911|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Basu|first1=Analabha|year=2003|title=Ethnic India: A Genomic View, With Special Reference to Peopling and Structure|journal=Genome Research|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2277\u20132290|doi=10.1101/gr.1413403|pmid=14525929|pmc=403703}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=George|first1=Sudhir Jacob|year=1994|title=The Bodo Movement in Assam: Unrest to Accord|url=|journal=Asian Survey|publisher=University of California Press|pages=878\u2013892|volume=34|number=10|doi=10.1525/as.1994.34.10.00p0431w}}\n*{{Linguistic Survey of India|3|2}}\n* {{cite conference|ref=harv|via=|last=Mosahary|first=R N|authorlink=|title=The Boros : Their Origin, Migration and Settlement in Assam|book-title=Proceedings of Northeast India History Association|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701071648/http://dspace.nehu.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/11330/The%20boros%20(RN%20Mosahary).pdf|conference=|accessdate=2019-06-30|year=1983|publisher=Northeast India History Association|location=Barapani|isbn=|volume=|page=|pages=42\u201370}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Narjinari|first=Hira Charan|authorlink=|title=Reassertiveness of the Great Bodos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1RuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|pages=|ref=eighth|last=GoI|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|title=Eighth Scheduled Indian Languages|url=http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf|access-date=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010536/http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf#|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4ba1AAAAIAAJ|title=The place of Assam in the history and civilisation of India |last=Chatterjee |first=S.K.|publisher= Guwahati University |year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv\n  | last = Chatterji\n  | first = S.
