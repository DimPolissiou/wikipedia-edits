{"title_page": "Port, Templeport", "text_new": "[[File:Port, Templeport.jpg|thumb|Road beside Templeport Lough, County Cavan, Ireland, heading west.]]\n\n'''Port''' ({{Irish derived place name|Port meaning 'A Landing-Place'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good. Dignum [arbitramur]''.<ref>Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 6, 1404-1415, ed. W H Bliss and J A Twemlow (London, 1904), p. 476.</ref> In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Port was one of these four polls.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1|page=[https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1/page/n90 71]|quote=Kilfert.|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression|first=Mervyn|last=Archdall|date=14 September 1873|publisher=W.

This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=templeporte]</ref> Port was one of these six pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Port was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Port formed part of the six polls in this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert\u2019s son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as ''The Lord of Cavan'', who also appears as proprietor of several other Templeport townlands in the same survey.\n\n'''Rectorial Tithes'''\n\nFrom medieval times the rectorial tithes were split between the local parish priest who received 1/3 and the Abbey of Kells who received 2/3, until they were seized in the 16th century [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].\n\nA list of the rectories owned by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1542 included ''Templeporte''. <ref>[https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/399f6945-52dd-488f-b5ca-67b1ebee2197]</ref>\n\nIn 1587 [[Elizabeth I of England]] granted the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to Garret (otherwise Gerald) Fleming of Cabragh.\n\nOn 30 October 1603 the aforementioned Gerrald Fleming surrendered the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to King [[James VI and I]] and it was regranted to him for a term of 21 years.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NOpEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Templeporte+-%22temple.+porte%22&source=bl&ots=XWUq-iU279&sig=ACfU3U0b7j0pzmsRAZHvk6kXEsnjPlr0zQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiokNW3qbbhAhXnUhUIHei8DegQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Templeporte%20-%22temple.%20porte%22&f=false]</ref> \n\nBy grant dated 22 December 1608, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of the rectories, churches, or chapels formerly belonging to Kells Abbey, including ''Templeporte'' to Gerald Fleminge of Cabragh, County Cavan.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XD5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%27%27Templeporte%27%27+Garret&source=bl&ots=sGV4wUjhEp&sig=ACfU3U0mP1uxoar0qOGb-BvYxf9wWd13qg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih25KI2sjjAhUPWhUIHczeAjAQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=''Crodraghe''%20Garret&f=false]</ref>\n\nOn 4 March 1609 the aforementioned Gerrald Fleming sold the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to his son James Fleming and Walter Talbot of [[Ballyconnell]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=PR111&lpg=PR111&dq=Templeporte+-%22temple.+porte%22&source=bl&ots=q1ovKk1-Vm&sig=ACfU3U33GHoNgmSL8I9RZRps4POAcS2nGg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihlav7qrbhAhV1SxUIHfDCD-04ChDoATAEegQIBRAB#v=onepage&q=Templeporte%20-%22temple.%20porte%22&f=false]</ref> On 8 June 1619 the aforesaid James Fleming and Walter Talbot were pardoned by King [[James VI and I]] for obtaining the said rectory of ''Templeport'' without getting a licence from the king.\n\nAn Inquisition held at Cavan on 19 October 1616 stated that the aforementioned Gerald Fleming died on 5 April 1615 and his son Thomas Fleming (born 1589) succeeded to the rectorial tithes of ''Templeporte''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=RA6-PA9&dq=Clontegrigenie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn2_as1PraAhVsLsAKHaGyBo0Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=crodragh&f=false]</ref>\n\nIn 1622 Thomas Moigne, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]] made a visitation to the parish. He found that the rectory was impropriate to the vicar of Templeport, John Patrick, who was not a resident, but that there was a curate resident. The annual value of the rectory was \u00a320. The church was in a ruinous condition and the parsonage was a timber house.\n\nOn 9 March 1669 King [[Charles II of England]] granted ''to Josias Hallington, incumbent of Templeport, Co.

In his book ''Memoirs of Major M\u2019Gauran'', Volume I, Page 127 (London 1786), he states (about the year 1765)- ''Upon my return from Luxemburg, the General wrote to Mr. John M'Gauran, of '''Port''', in the County of Cavan, married to Ann O'Donnel, the General's cousin-german, telling him that a cousin of his, grand-son of Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, and son of Mary O'Donnel, was serving then in Loudon's regiment, quartered where he resided. Mr. M'Gauran, jealous of my prosperity, having many young sons of his own, whom he thought better entitled to the General's protection; but, notwithstanding, though he knew me to be his own near relation, wrote to the General, to inform him that I was not the son of Mary O'Donnel, but an impostor. The General shewed me the letter, and asked me the truth, which I told him, together with the motives I had for not revealing it sooner; all of which he approved, and matters seemed to be accommodated''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmajore_01mgau]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmajored02mgau]</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Purt''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts Port as still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good.

As the Hulk attacks the Warbound, Miek reveals the explosion that started this war was not caused by the Illuminati, but by Red King loyalists. Miek chose not to prevent it, hoping the incident would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Overwhelming rage causes the Hulk to unwillingly radiate energy that threatens Earth.

The series continued the story of Hercules and Amadeus Cho.\n\nA continuation of both \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\" began in May 2009. A special stand-alone prologue and ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #11 saw the beginning of \"[[Planet Skaar]]\", an arc intended to bring [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] directly into the middle of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Following the return of the Silver Savage (the [[Silver Surfer]]), events begin to spiral, forcing Skaar to not only abandon Sakaar but to head towards Earth. As was revealed by series writer [[Greg Pak]], [[Mister Fantastic]], Reed Richards, is not amused with the arrival of another [[Hulk]]-like being, and the meeting between father and son will not be very pleasant for the Hulk.\n\nIn the 2010 \"[[World War Hulks]]\" storyline, it is revealed that the satellites used to revert Hulk to Banner at the end of \"World War Hulk\" siphoned off the [[gamma radiation]] from his body, in order to collect it for the cathexis ray later used to create the [[Thunderbolt Ross#Red Hulk|Red Hulk]].<ref name=\"HulkV2#23\">{{cite comic|Writer=[[Jeph Loeb]]|Penciller=[[Ed McGuiness]]|Inker=[[Mark Farmer]]|Story=Who is the Red Hulk?|Title=Hulk|volume=2|Issue=1|Date=August 2010|Publisher=Marvel Comics|}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n===World War Hulk II===\nA sequel arc titled ''World War Hulk II'' is shown in the issues of ''The Incredible Hulk''. After returning from a restored Sakaar, Amadeus Cho's Hulk faces off against Phalkan. His Hulk form's persona changed to where it easily defeated Phalkan and used his \"computer brain\" to leave Phalkan with a broken arm, a broken foot, a punctured lung, and some broken ribs.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #714 - 717. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===''What If?''===\nFor the 2009 ''What If'' series, there was a ''What If? World War Hulk'' one-shot which examines two alternatives to the storyline:<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |title=Fan Expo: Gabrie & Allo on 2009 \"What If?\" Specials |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22735 |work=Comic Book Resources |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2009}}</ref>\n* The first tale shows Tony Stark not hesitating to fire the laser satellite into New York City, killing the Warbound and many heroes during Hulk's fight with the Sentry. Watching from hiding, the [[Skrull]]s hear of the death of their queen [[Veranke]] (masquerading as Spider-Woman), but believe the Hulk is a prophet sent to aid them by destroying the heroes. They attack, their sleeper agents allowing them to wipe out most of the remaining super-beings and take over the world. Two months later, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] finds Bruce Banner in the ruins of New York, waiting to die, and convinces him to become the Hulk again and help. The Hulk aids the remaining heroes against the Skrulls, inspiring people to help. In this world, it's the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] who's a Skrull, and she infects [[Henry Pym]] with the bio-weapon that wipes out the remaining heroes. The Hulk survives and summons the [[Silver Surfer]], demanding the Surfer call [[Galactus]] to destroy Earth. The Surfer does so, but leaves, disgusted at the Hulk's bloodthirsty ways. Galactus arrives and feeds upon Earth, destroying the Skrulls and the planet. He lets The Hulk live, promising to take away the monster's pain and memories. The Hulk agrees, and is transformed into Galactus' new herald, the World-Breaker.\n* The second story has [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Warriors Three]] flying back from Africa on a plane when they hear of The Hulk's attack. Thor leads the others against the Hulk's forces. He and the Hulk engage in a massive battle across Manhattan, before learning of civilians needing help in destroyed subway tunnels, and work together to save them. Thor manages to get through to the Hulk, convincing him to give up his vendetta. Back at Madison Square Garden, the Warbound have discovered Miek's role in the destruction of Sakaar and have surrendered. The Sentry arrives only to find the battle over. Thor negotiates a settlement for all parties with the Hulk and his forces returning to rebuild Sakaar and leave Earth in peace.\n\n===Marvel Zombies Return===\nIn the last issue, the Earth-Z version of Hulk became infected while on the moon, the rest of the Warbound being devoured by the zombie Inhumans (with the Hulk eating [[Elloe Kaifi]] when the infection takes control of him). Instead of seeking revenge on the Avengers and Earth, he returned to Earth to satisfy his hunger, and in turn, infects the version of the Sentry that was responsible for the outbreak in the first place. This Hulk goes on to join [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies|Spider-Man]]'s team of New Avengers when the Sentry turns against him.\n\n===Mini Marvels===\nIn [[Chris Giarrusso|Chris Giarrusso's]] [[Mini Marvels]] comics, a World War Hulk three-story series had been written.\n\n==Sales==\n''World War Hulk'' No. 1 was at the top of the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]' sales chart for June 2007, selling an estimated 178,302 copies.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11515 ''Comic Book Resources'': Sales Estimates for June, 2007 Books], August 8, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> When the first issue sold out, Marvel announced a second printing would have a variant cover by [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124786 \"''World War Hulk'' No. 1 Sells Out, Second Printing Coming\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083210/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124786 |date=September 29, 2007 }}, August 10, 2007, Marvel Comics press release, [[Newsarama]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110529152001/http://marvel.com/comic_books/events/277/world_war_hulk Marvel In-Comic Events: World War Hulk]\n* [http://comicbookimagesgallery.com/tags/world%20war%20hulk ''World War Hulk'' Cover Gallery]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=World War Hulk\n|list1=\n{{Marvel events}}\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{Mighty Avengers}}\n{{New Avengers}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{X-Comics}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hulk (comics) titles]]\n[[Category:Planetary romances]]\n[[Category:Comics by Greg Pak]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2007 comic|the 2010 comic|World War Hulks}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox comics story arc <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|title          = World War Hulk\n|image = World War Hulk 1.jpg\n|caption = {{Descript-cvr|World War Hulk||1|Aug 2007}} Art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].\n|publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n|startmo = May\n|startyr = 2007\n|endmo = November \n|endyr = 2007\n|Crossover = y\n|Superhero = y\n|genre=[[Superhero fiction|Superhero]]\n|titles = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #4\u20135<br><!--\n-->''[[Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 6, #12\u201313<br><!--\n-->''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' vol. 2, #11\u201315<br><!--\n-->''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #106\u2013112<br /><!--\n-->''incredible Hercules'' #113-115<br /><!--\n-->''[[Iron Man|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' vol. 1, #19\u201320<br><!--\n-->''[[The Irredeemable Ant-Man]]'' #10<br><!--\n-->''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2, #12<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk'' #1\u20135<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk Prologue: World Breaker'' #1<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk: Front Line'' #1\u20136<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk: Gamma Corps'' #1\u20134<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #1\u20133<br><!--\n-->''World War Hulk: Gamma Files'' \n|main_char_team = [[Hulk]]<BR>[[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]<BR>[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]<BR>[[Warbound]]<BR>[[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]\n|writers = [[Greg Pak]]\n|artists =\n|pencillers = [[John Romita Jr.]]\n|inkers = [[Klaus Janson]]\n|letterers =\n|editors =\n|colorists = [[Christina Strain]]\n|TPB =World War Hulk\n|ISBN =978-0785125969\n|cat = Hulk (comics)\n|sortkey = World War Hulk\n|self-titled = y\n}}\n\"'''World War Hulk'''\" is a comic book [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline that ran through a self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and various titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in 2007, featuring the [[Hulk]].<ref name =\"''Hulk'' No. 106 Preview\">{{cite news| title =First Look: Gary Frank's ''Incredible Hulk'' No. 106 Cover| publisher=Marvel.com |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.722| accessdate =February 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe series consists of five main issues titled ''World War Hulk'', with [[Greg Pak]] as writer and [[John Romita Jr.]] as [[penciller]], and three other [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]: ''World War Hulk: Front Line'', ''[[Gamma Corps|World War Hulk: Gamma Corps]]'', and ''[[World War Hulk: X-Men]]''.

The series continued the story of Hercules and Amadeus Cho.\n\nA continuation of both \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\" began in May 2009. A special stand-alone prologue and ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #11 saw the beginning of \"[[Planet Skaar]]\", an arc intended to bring [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] directly into the middle of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Following the return of the Silver Savage (the [[Silver Surfer]]), events begin to spiral, forcing Skaar to not only abandon Sakaar but to head towards Earth. As was revealed by series writer [[Greg Pak]], [[Mister Fantastic]], Reed Richards, is not amused with the arrival of another [[Hulk]]-like being, and the meeting between father and son will not be very pleasant for the Hulk.\n\nIn the 2010 \"[[World War Hulks]]\" storyline, it is revealed that the satellites used to revert Hulk to Banner at the end of \"World War Hulk\" siphoned off the [[gamma radiation]] from his body, in order to collect it for the cathexis ray later used to create the [[Thunderbolt Ross#Red Hulk|Red Hulk]].<ref name=\"HulkV2#23\">{{cite comic|Writer=[[Jeph Loeb]]|Penciller=[[Ed McGuiness]]|Inker=[[Mark Farmer]]|Story=Who is the Red Hulk?|Title=Hulk|volume=2|Issue=1|Date=August 2010|Publisher=Marvel Comics|}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n===World War Hulk II===\nA sequel arc titled ''World War Hulk II'' is shown in the issues of ''The Incredible Hulk''.

Watching from hiding, the [[Skrull]]s hear of the death of their queen [[Veranke]] (masquerading as Spider-Woman), but believe the Hulk is a prophet sent to aid them by destroying the heroes. They attack, their sleeper agents allowing them to wipe out most of the remaining super-beings and take over the world. Two months later, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] finds Bruce Banner in the ruins of New York, waiting to die, and convinces him to become the Hulk again and help. The Hulk aids the remaining heroes against the Skrulls, inspiring people to help. In this world, it's the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] who's a Skrull, and she infects [[Henry Pym]] with the bio-weapon that wipes out the remaining heroes. The Hulk survives and summons the [[Silver Surfer]], demanding the Surfer call [[Galactus]] to destroy Earth. The Surfer does so, but leaves, disgusted at the Hulk's bloodthirsty ways. Galactus arrives and feeds upon Earth, destroying the Skrulls and the planet. He lets The Hulk live, promising to take away the monster's pain and memories. The Hulk agrees, and is transformed into Galactus' new herald, the World-Breaker.\n* The second story has [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Warriors Three]] flying back from Africa on a plane when they hear of The Hulk's attack. Thor leads the others against the Hulk's forces. He and the Hulk engage in a massive battle across Manhattan, before learning of civilians needing help in destroyed subway tunnels, and work together to save them. Thor manages to get through to the Hulk, convincing him to give up his vendetta. Back at Madison Square Garden, the Warbound have discovered Miek's role in the destruction of Sakaar and have surrendered. The Sentry arrives only to find the battle over. Thor negotiates a settlement for all parties with the Hulk and his forces returning to rebuild Sakaar and leave Earth in peace.\n\n===Marvel Zombies Return===\nIn the last issue, the Earth-Z version of Hulk became infected while on the moon, the rest of the Warbound being devoured by the zombie Inhumans (with the Hulk eating [[Elloe Kaifi]] when the infection takes control of him). Instead of seeking revenge on the Avengers and Earth, he returned to Earth to satisfy his hunger, and in turn, infects the version of the Sentry that was responsible for the outbreak in the first place. This Hulk goes on to join [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies|Spider-Man]]'s team of New Avengers when the Sentry turns against him.\n\n===Mini Marvels===\nIn [[Chris Giarrusso|Chris Giarrusso's]] [[Mini Marvels]] comics, a World War Hulk three-story series had been written.\n\n==Sales==\n''World War Hulk'' No. 1 was at the top of the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]' sales chart for June 2007, selling an estimated 178,302 copies.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11515 ''Comic Book Resources'': Sales Estimates for June, 2007 Books], August 8, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> When the first issue sold out, Marvel announced a second printing would have a variant cover by [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124786 \"''World War Hulk'' No. 1 Sells Out, Second Printing Coming\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083210/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124786 |date=September 29, 2007 }}, August 10, 2007, Marvel Comics press release, [[Newsarama]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110529152001/http://marvel.com/comic_books/events/277/world_war_hulk Marvel In-Comic Events: World War Hulk]\n* [http://comicbookimagesgallery.com/tags/world%20war%20hulk ''World War Hulk'' Cover Gallery]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=World War Hulk\n|list1=\n{{Marvel events}}\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{Mighty Avengers}}\n{{New Avengers}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{X-Comics}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hulk (comics) titles]]\n[[Category:Planetary romances]]\n[[Category:Comics by Greg Pak]]\n", "name_user": "TheSandDoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "rm redundant title param", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Hulk"}

They  compete in [[Ligue 1]], the top tier of [[Football in France]], the club plays it's home matches at the [[Roazhon Park]], located within the city. The team is managed by [[Julien St\u00e9phan]]. The team's president is Jacques Delano\u00eb (interim) and its owner is Art\u00e9mis, the holding company of businessman [[Fran\u00e7ois Pinault]].\n\nRennes was founded in 1901 under the name Stade Rennais and is one of the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|founding members]] of the first division of French football. Alongside [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], Rennes is one of the top football clubs in the region and the two are among the main clubs that contest the [[Derby Breton]]. The club's best finish in the league has been fourth with the club accomplishing this feat on four occasions, most recently in [[2006\u201307 Ligue 1|2006\u201307]]. Rennes has won three [[Coupe de France]] titles in [[1965 Coupe de France Final|1965]], [[1971 Coupe de France Final|1971]] and [[2019 Coupe de France Final|2019]]. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version.\n\nRennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]] Training Centre, which was formed in 2000. The [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) recognised Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rennes, champion de France de la formation |url=http://www.maxifoot.fr/football/article-9760.htm |publisher=MaxiFoot |date= 9 June 2010|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> The cornerstone of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the [[Coupe Gambardella]] three times in 1973, 2003 and 2008. The academy has produced several notable talents, such as [[Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]], [[Yacine Brahimi]], [[Eduardo Camavinga]], [[Yoann Gourcuff]], [[Yann M'Vila]], [[Moussa Sow]], [[Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9]], [[Sylvain Wiltord]], and [[Jimmy Briand]], among others.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Stade Rennais F.C.}}\n\n[[File:Stade rennais 1904.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Stade Rennais in 1904.]]\n\nStade Rennais Football Club was founded on 10 March 1901 by a group of former students living in [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. Football had quickly become widely circulated in nearby regions and it was soon brought to Brittany. The club's first match was played two weeks later against FC Rennais, which Stade lost 6\u20130. In 1902, Stade Rennais joined the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques|USFSA]] federation and, subsequently, became a founding member of the Ligue de Bretagne de football, a newly created regional league founded by the federation. In the second league season, the club won the competition after defeating the inaugural league w\n|Coupe de France final]] for the fourth time in its history. In the final, Rennes faced Breton rival [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] and was the heavy favourite. Despite taking the lead in the second half, however, Rennes was defeated 2\u20131 after Guingamp scored two goals in a ten-minute span. In 2014, Rennes made the [[2014 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France final]] and once again their opponent was [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]]. In a tense final, Rennes lost the match to their fierce rivals 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2050480-guingamp-upset-neighbours-rennes-by-lifting-the-2014-coupe-de-france|title=Guingamp Upset Neighbours Rennes by Lifting the 2014 Coupe De France|first=Andrew|last=Gibney}}</ref> In the 2017/2018 Ligue 1 season, Rennes had one of their best campaigns in recent memory finishing 5th and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.<ref>https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2551855.html</ref>\n\n== Stadium ==\n{{main|Roazhon Park}}\n\n[[File:Stade Route de Lorient hermines.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|The ''[[Ermine (heraldry)|Hermine]]'' symbols outside the Roazhon Park]]\n\nRennes has played on the land where the club's stadium, the [[Roazhon Park]], situates itself since 1912. The Roazhon Park, then named Stade de Route de Lorient, which is its address, was constructed in 1912. The facility was inaugurated on 15 September 1912 in a match between Rennes and SA du Lyc\u00e9e de Rennes. The Stade de la Route de Lorient was officially inaugurated a month later when Rennes took on [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Club de France]] in front of 3,000 spectators.\n\nThe Roazhon Park is owned by the city of Rennes and has undergone renovations three times, in 1955, 1983 and 1999. In 1983, the club renovated the stadium in an attempt to resemble the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in Munich. After nearly four years of renovation, the new stadium was unveiled on 7 March 1987. In 1999, the new renovations, which were designed by architect Bruno Gaudin, cost \u20ac37.3&nbsp;million and took four years to complete. The stadium's inauguration was celebrated twice: in a match between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in August 2004, and another football match contesting by Rennes and [[FC Metz|Metz]] two months later. The current capacity of the stadium is 29,778.<ref name=\"infrastructure\"/>\n\n=== Training centre ===\n\n[[File:ETP Odorico.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|The entrance to the \u00c9cole Technique Priv\u00e9e Odorico, a section of the Stade Rennais youth academy]]\n\nThe Centre d'entra\u00eenement Henri-Gu\u00e9rin (Henri-Gu\u00e9rin Training Center), colloquially known as ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'', was inaugurated in June 2000. Named for former club player and manager [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]], ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' is located on the outskirts of Rennes just southwest of Roazhon Park. The centre hosts the senior team's training sessions, as well as the club's reserve and youth teams. In 2007, ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' became the home of the club's administrative and business headquarters.\n\nSince its inception, ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' has become reputed for its consistent production of youth talent, bringing through players that have become household names at the international level. In that time, the club's youth system has made up most of the club's first team. [[2019\u201320 in French football|Current]] first-team players [[Eduardo Camavinga]] and [[Joris Gnagnon]] were graduates of the academy. Rennes has been awarded the honour of having the best youth academy in France.\n\nRennes has won the [[Coupe Gambardella]], the under-19 national youth competition, three times, in 1973, 2003 and 2008. In 2003, the team that won was anchored by [[Yoann Gourcuff]] and Marveaux. Gourcuff went on to win both the [[Troph\u00e9es UNFP du football|UNFP Player of the Year]] and [[France Football|French Player of the Year]] awards and established himself as a [[France national football team|French international]]. Marveaux graduated from the academy after the Gambardella triumph and went on to appear in over 100 matches for Rennes. He had his best season in the [[2009\u201310 in French football|2009\u201310 season]], appearing in 38 matches and scoring 12 goals. In 2008, the team that won the competition was composed of Brahimi, M'Vila, Souprayen, [[Yohann Lasimant]], Quentin Rouger, K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile-Catherine, and [[Damien Le Tallec]]. Six of the seven players made appearances with the first-team. Le Tallec moved to German club [[Borussia Dortmund]] before he could make an appearance.\n\n== Supporters ==\n[[Image:Staderennais-routelorient.JPG|220px|left|thumb|Flares of the ''Roazhon Celtic Kop'' at the Roazhon Park.]]\n\nRennes have several supporter groups associated with the club, ranging from groups of senior supporters to ''ultras''. The oldest, most structured and frequented is Allez Rennes. The group was founded in 1962 and together with ''Les Socios'', founded in 1992, is the largest group of traditional supporters.\n\nThe section of the stadium popularly called ''Tribune Mordelles'' is occupied by the Roazhon Celtic Kop (RCK). Although the group was founded in 1991, its roots date back to 1987 when a group of supporters known as Ultras Roazhon was formed. The RCK was formed by three young supporters who decided to establish the Mordelles stand as the true hot spot of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=19&id=AT30 |title=Roazhon Celtic Kop |publisher=Stade Rennais FC |language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> The group marks its presence not only through continuous singing and the use of flares, but also through numerous tifos and choreographic celebrations. The Breton identity is regularly displayed and the use of [[Celts|Celtic]] symbols is frequent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rck91.ifrance.com/presentation.htm |title=Presentation |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop|language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> A special feat of the RCK is that the group is responsible for having made the largest [[Flag of Brittany|Gwenn-ha-du]] in history measuring 270 square metres. It was displayed at the Mordelles stand during the 1994\u201395 season.<ref>Leicester University, ''Sport in the Making of Celtic Cultures (Sport and Nation)'', Grant, Jarvie, 1999, p.82. {{ISBN|0-718-50129-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prouff Banderole.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The RCK giving homage to the deceased former player [[Jean Prouff]] in 2008.]]\n\nThe RCK functions as an unconditional supporters' group present at all matches, including those at European level, and gathers supporters mainly of the ''[[ultras|ultra]]''-mentality, but also holds on to its values describe by the group as ''Amiti\u00e9, Respect et F\u00eate'' (''Friendship, Respect and Party''). The Kop keeps an open attitude towards those supporters of Rennes who share them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rck91.ifrance.com/presentation.htm |title=Presentation |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop|language=French |accessdate = 5 January 2015}}</ref> The group has taken a strong position against \"football business\", the suppression of the ''ultra''-movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/Roazhon-Celtic-Kop,104.html|title=Roazhon Celtic Kop}}</ref> and racism. Although the group is not officially political, it regularly manifests [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Keltz|2012|p=115}} The RCK is a member of the RSRA (R\u00e9seau Supporter de R\u00e9sistance Antiraciste),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.non-au-racisme.com/lutte.php|title=Non au racisme \u2013 La lutte|website=non-au-racisme.com}}</ref> a French network of football supporter groups against racism, and involved in [[Football Against Racism in Europe|Fare]], a European network of football supporter groups against racism and discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=22&id=AT2033|title=STADE RENNAIS F.C.|website=STADE RENNAIS F.C.}}</ref>\n\nAnother major supporter group of the club is the Section Roazhon Pariz. It is a section of the RCK that is situated in Paris. The group supports the team at important away matches, such as those against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://srp.rck91.free.fr/presentation_srp1.htm |title=Presentation: Section Roazhon Pariz |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop |language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> The RCK makes no attempt to hide its chaotic and festive appearance. In 2003, a second group of ultras, the Breizh Stourmer (\"Breton Warriors\") was formed through a break with the RCK. The group was created around the idea of a small, strong core of supporters and chose to situate themselves on the opposite side of the RCK. The Breizh Stourmer has been accused by elements of the RCK for certain members holding extreme-right views.{{sfn|Keltz|2012|p=115}} Violent clashes between radical members of the two groups have occurred. The main rival of the RCK has, however, not been the Breizh Stourmer, but for many years, the Brigade Loire, a supporters' group of Rennes' rival club [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. The Breizh Stourmer has since dissolved. In 2008, a new group of supporters, the Unvez Kelt (UK) (\"Celtic Unity\"), was founded. The group was initially refused by the club as an official group, however, with the help of Les Socios, it was finally accepted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/Unvez-Kelt.html |title=Unvez Kelt |publisher=Stade Rennais FC |language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> Failing to establish itself and after several problems, among them a fire that destroyed its premises in November 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/L-Unvez-Kelt-sous-le-choc-apres-un.html|title=L'Unvez Kelt sous le choc apr\u00e8s un myst\u00e9rieux incendie}}</ref> clashes with the [[National Police (France)|National Police]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/1497-Supporters-et-SIR-une.html|title=Supporters et SIR : une cohabitation qui s'annonce difficile}}</ref> and incidents resulting in several of its members becoming arrested during an away match at [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in 2012,{{sfn|Keltz|2012|p=121}} the Unvez Kelt decided to dissolve in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/+Supporters-dissolution-des-Unvez+.html|title=Supporters : dissolution des Unvez Kelt}}</ref>\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Current squad ===\n\n====First team====\n{{Updated|1 February 2020}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/effectif/pros |title=Equipe Pro |publisher=Stade Rennais FC |language=French |accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=[[Romain Salin]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=[[Damien Da Silva]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=[[Gerzino Nyamsi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=SWE|pos=MF|name=[[Jakob Johansson (footballer)|Jakob Johansson]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=BRA|pos=MF|name=[[Raphinha (footballer, born 1996)|Raphinha]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Cl\u00e9ment Grenier]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=[[Theoson Siebatcheu|Jordan Siebatcheu]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Rafik Guitane]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=SEN|pos=FW|name=[[M'Baye Niang]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[James Lea Siliki]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Benjamin Bourigeaud]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=MAD|pos=DF|name=[[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Morel]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=SEN|pos=GK|name=[[\u00c9douard Mendy]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=[[Faitout Maouassa]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Eduardo Camavinga]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=TUR|pos=FW|name=[[Metehan G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Flavien Tait]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=CIV|pos=DF|name=[[Joris Gnagnon]]|other=on loan from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=[[Romain Del Castillo]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Adrien Hunou]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Steven Nzonzi]]|other=on loan from [[A.S.

They  compete in [[Ligue 1]], the top tier of [[Football in France]], the club plays it's home matches at the [[Roazhon Park]], located within the city. The team is managed by [[Julien St\u00e9phan]]. The team's president is Jacques Delano\u00eb (interim) and its owner is Art\u00e9mis, the holding company of businessman [[Fran\u00e7ois Pinault]].\n\nRennes was founded in 1901 under the name Stade Rennais and is one of the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|founding members]] of the first division of French football. Alongside [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], Rennes is one of the top football clubs in the region and the two are among the main clubs that contest the [[Derby Breton]]. The club's best finish in the league has been fourth with the club accomplishing this feat on four occasions, most recently in [[2006\u201307 Ligue 1|2006\u201307]]. Rennes has won three [[Coupe de France]] titles in [[1965 Coupe de France Final|1965]], [[1971 Coupe de France Final|1971]] and [[2019 Coupe de France Final|2019]]. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version.\n\nRennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]] Training Centre, which was formed in 2000. The [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) recognised Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rennes, champion de France de la formation |url=http://www.maxifoot.fr/football/article-9760.htm |publisher=MaxiFoot |date= 9 June 2010|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> The cornerstone of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the [[Coupe Gambardella]] three times in 1973, 2003 and 2008.

Football had quickly become widely circulated in nearby regions and it was soon brought to Brittany. The club's first match was played two weeks later against FC Rennais, which Stade lost 6\u20130. In 1902, Stade Rennais joined the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques|USFSA]] federation and, subsequently, became a founding member of the Ligue de Bretagne de football, a newly created regional league founded by the federation. In the second league season, the club won the competition after defeating the inaugural league winners FC Rennais 4\u20130 in the final. On 4 May 1904, Stade Rennais merged with its rivals FC Rennais to form '''Stade Rennais Universit\u00e9 Club''', with the primary objective being to overcome the recent domination of the Ligue de Bretagne by [[US Saint-Malo]], then known as US Saint-Servan, which fielded mostly British players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=20&id=AT50 |title=Les ann\u00e9es 1900: le Stade Rennais voit le jour |publisher=Stade Rennais FC |language=French |date=15 July 2007|accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> The new club adopted the colours of Rennais, which consisted of a red and black combination with black vertical stripes on the shirt. After three years of Saint-Malo dominating the league, Rennes finally eclipsed the club in 1908 under the leadership of Welsh manager Arthur Griffith. In the following season, Rennes won the league again, but in 1910 Rennes was unable to win a third, as Saint-Malo won the league by two points. The champions subsequently went on an impressive run in which it won the league for the next four seasons over.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Rennes began focusing its efforts on winning the recently created [[Coupe de France]]. Strengthened by the arrivals of internationals Bernard Lenoble, Maurice Gastiger, [[Ernest Molles]] and captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Hugues]] after the war, in the competition's fourth campaign, Rennes reached the final. In the [[1922 Coupe de France Final|match]], the club faced two-time defending champions [[FC Red Star Saint-Ouen|Red Star Olympique]], which was led by attacker [[Paul Nicolas]], defender [[Lucien Gamblin]] and goalkeeper [[Pierre Chayrigu\u00e8s]].

In 1929, Rennes departed the league after disagreeing with the increased number of games the league sought to implement in the new season. The departure led to Rennes becoming a \"[[free agent]]\", and the club played numerous friendly matches to compensate for the loss of league matches.\n\n[[File:Isidore Odorico.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The presidency of Isidore Odorico marked the history of the club during the 1920\u20131930s.]]\n\nIn July 1930, the National Council of the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) voted 128\u201320 in support of professionalism in French football. Under the leadership of club president Isidore Odorico, Rennes was among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and became founding members of the new league. In the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|league's inaugural season]], Rennes finished mid-table in its group. Two years later, in 1935, the club reached the final of the Coupe de France for the second time. Rennes, however, lost to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] 3\u20130 after failing to overcome three first-half goals. The club's attack was also limited in the match due to being deprived of its top two attackers, [[Walter Kaiser (footballer)|Walter Kaiser]] and Walter Vollweiler, who were both injured. Rennes spent four more years in the first division before suffering relegation to Division 2 in the [[1936\u201337 French Division 1|1936\u201337 season]]. Rennes played in Division 2 before professionalism was abolished due to [[World War II]]. After the war, Rennes returned to Division 1. Led by the Austrian-born Frenchman [[Franz Pleyer]], Rennes achieved its best finish in the league after finishing fourth in the [[1948\u201349 French Division 1|1948\u201349 campaign]]. Despite the domestic resurgence under Pleyer, the club struggled to maintain the consistency and, in the 1950s, rotated between the first division and the second division under the watch of the Spaniard [[Salvador Artigas]] and [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]], who acted in a player-coach role.\n\nUnder the leadership of new president Louis Girard, Rennes underwent a major upheaval, which included renovations to the stadium. Girard sought to make Rennes competitive nationally and the first objective was achieved when the club earned promotion back to Division 1 in 1958. After finishing in the bottom-half of the table for six-straight seasons, Rennes, now managed by former club player [[Jean Prouff]], finished in fourth place in the [[1964\u201365 French Division 1|1964\u201365 season]]. In the same season, the club earned its first major honour after winning the Coupe de France. Rennes, led by players such as [[Daniel Rodighi\u00e9ro]], [[Georges Lamia]] and Jean-Claude Lavaud defeated [[CS Sedan Ardennes|UA Sedan-Torcy]] 3\u20131 in the replay of [[1965 Coupe de France Final|the final]]. The first leg of the match ended 2\u20132, which resulted in a replay. After the cup success, Rennes played in [[UEFA|European competition]] for the first time in the [[1965\u201366 European Cup Winners' Cup|1965\u201366 season]]. The club, however, lost to Czechoslovakian club [[Dukla Prague]] in the first round.\n\n[[File:Jean Prouff.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jean Prouff]], pictured in 1935, led Rennes to its major successes.]]\n\nIn the ensuing years, Rennes struggled in league play but performed well in the Coupe de France, reaching the semi-finals on two occasions in 1967 and 1970. In 1971, Rennes captured its second Coupe de France title after defeating [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] 1\u20130 with the only goal coming from a penalty conversion by [[Andr\u00e9 Guy]]. On 23 May 1972, Rennes officially changed its name to its current form. After another season in charge, Prouff departed Rennes and the club entered free-fall. From 1972 to 1994, Rennes was supervised by 11 different managers and, during the years, consistently hovered between Division 1 and Division 2. In 1978, the club was on the verge of bankruptcy and, as a result, was order by a [[tribunal]] to sell its biggest earners and enter a policy of [[austerity]]. In the 1980s, the city's municipality gained a majority stake in the club.\n\nIn 1994, Rennes returned to Division 1 and entered a period of stability mainly due to the utilisation of the club's youth academy. Instead of entering bidding wars for players, Rennes groomed its youngsters and inserted them onto the senior team when coaches felt they were ready. This strategy proved successful with players such as [[Sylvain Wiltord]], [[Jocelyn Gourvennec]] and [[Ulrich Le Pen]]. In 1998, the club was sold by the municipality to retail [[magnate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Pinault]]. Pinault invested a substantial amount of funding into the club and sought to increase Rennes' production of youth talent by constructing a training centre, which was completed in 2000. Pinault also paid for a completed re-construction of the stadium and also invested in the transfer market, recruiting several players from South America, most notably [[Lucas Severino]], whom Rennes paid a record \u20ac21&nbsp;million for.\n\nThe results were immediate in the decade from 2000 to 2010, with Rennes appearing in UEFA-sanctioned European competitions in five of the ten seasons. In youth production, the club produced several youth talents such as [[Yann M'Vila]], [[Yacine Brahimi]], [[Jimmy Briand]] and [[Abdoulaye Diallo]], among others. In league competition, Rennes tied its best finish ever in the league by finishing fourth in [[2004\u201305 Ligue 1|2004\u201305]]. Two seasons later, the club accomplished this feat again. In 2009, Rennes reached the [[2009 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France final]] for the fourth time in its history. In the final, Rennes faced Breton rival [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] and was the heavy favourite. Despite taking the lead in the second half, however, Rennes was defeated 2\u20131 after Guingamp scored two goals in a ten-minute span. In 2014, Rennes made the [[2014 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France final]] and once again their opponent was [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]]. In a tense final, Rennes lost the match to their fierce rivals 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2050480-guingamp-upset-neighbours-rennes-by-lifting-the-2014-coupe-de-france|title=Guingamp Upset Neighbours Rennes by Lifting the 2014 Coupe De France|first=Andrew|last=Gibney}}</ref> In the 2017/2018 Ligue 1 season, Rennes had one of their best campaigns in recent memory finishing 5th and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.<ref>https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2551855.html</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Rennes claimed its third Coupe de France win on 27 April.

The Roazhon Park, then named Stade de Route de Lorient, which is its address, was constructed in 1912. The facility was inaugurated on 15 September 1912 in a match between Rennes and SA du Lyc\u00e9e de Rennes. The Stade de la Route de Lorient was officially inaugurated a month later when Rennes took on [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Club de France]] in front of 3,000 spectators.\n\nThe Roazhon Park is owned by the city of Rennes and has undergone renovations three times, in 1955, 1983 and 1999. In 1983, the club renovated the stadium in an attempt to resemble the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in Munich. After nearly four years of renovation, the new stadium was unveiled on 7 March 1987. In 1999, the new renovations, which were designed by architect Bruno Gaudin, cost \u20ac37.3&nbsp;million and took four years to complete. The stadium's inauguration was celebrated twice: in a match between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in August 2004, and another football match contesting by Rennes and [[FC Metz|Metz]] two months later. The current capacity of the stadium is 29,778.<ref name=\"infrastructure\"/>\n\n=== Training centre ===\n\n[[File:ETP Odorico.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|The entrance to the \u00c9cole Technique Priv\u00e9e Odorico, a section of the Stade Rennais youth academy]]\n\nThe Centre d'entra\u00eenement Henri-Gu\u00e9rin (Henri-Gu\u00e9rin Training Center), colloquially known as ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'', was inaugurated in June 2000. Named for former club player and manager [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]], ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' is located on the outskirts of Rennes just southwest of Roazhon Park. The centre hosts the senior team's training sessions, as well as the club's reserve and youth teams. In 2007, ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' became the home of the club's administrative and business headquarters.\n\nSince its inception, ''La Piverdi\u00e8re'' has become reputed for its consistent production of youth talent, bringing through players that have become household names at the international level. In that time, the club's youth system has made up most of the club's first team. [[2019\u201320 in French football|Current]] first-team players [[Eduardo Camavinga]] and [[Joris Gnagnon]] were graduates of the academy. Rennes has been awarded the honour of having the best youth academy in France.\n\nRennes has won the [[Coupe Gambardella]], the under-19 national youth competition, three times, in 1973, 2003 and 2008. In 2003, the team that won was anchored by [[Yoann Gourcuff]] and Marveaux. Gourcuff went on to win both the [[Troph\u00e9es UNFP du football|UNFP Player of the Year]] and [[France Football|French Player of the Year]] awards and established himself as a [[France national football team|French international]]. Marveaux graduated from the academy after the Gambardella triumph and went on to appear in over 100 matches for Rennes. He had his best season in the [[2009\u201310 in French football|2009\u201310 season]], appearing in 38 matches and scoring 12 goals. In 2008, the team that won the competition was composed of Brahimi, M'Vila, Souprayen, [[Yohann Lasimant]], Quentin Rouger, K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile-Catherine, and [[Damien Le Tallec]]. Six of the seven players made appearances with the first-team. Le Tallec moved to German club [[Borussia Dortmund]] before he could make an appearance.\n\n== Supporters ==\n[[Image:Staderennais-routelorient.JPG|220px|left|thumb|Flares of the ''Roazhon Celtic Kop'' at the Roazhon Park.]]\n\nRennes have several supporter groups associated with the club, ranging from groups of senior supporters to ''ultras''. The oldest, most structured and frequented is Allez Rennes. The group was founded in 1962 and together with ''Les Socios'', founded in 1992, is the largest group of traditional supporters.\n\nThe section of the stadium popularly called ''Tribune Mordelles'' is occupied by the Roazhon Celtic Kop (RCK). Although the group was founded in 1991, its roots date back to 1987 when a group of supporters known as Ultras Roazhon was formed. The RCK was formed by three young supporters who decided to establish the Mordelles stand as the true hot spot of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=19&id=AT30 |title=Roazhon Celtic Kop |publisher=Stade Rennais FC |language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> The group marks its presence not only through continuous singing and the use of flares, but also through numerous tifos and choreographic celebrations. The Breton identity is regularly displayed and the use of [[Celts|Celtic]] symbols is frequent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rck91.ifrance.com/presentation.htm |title=Presentation |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop|language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> A special feat of the RCK is that the group is responsible for having made the largest [[Flag of Brittany|Gwenn-ha-du]] in history measuring 270 square metres.

The Kop keeps an open attitude towards those supporters of Rennes who share them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rck91.ifrance.com/presentation.htm |title=Presentation |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop|language=French |accessdate = 5 January 2015}}</ref> The group has taken a strong position against \"football business\", the suppression of the ''ultra''-movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/Roazhon-Celtic-Kop,104.html|title=Roazhon Celtic Kop}}</ref> and racism.

It is a section of the RCK that is situated in Paris. The group supports the team at important away matches, such as those against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://srp.rck91.free.fr/presentation_srp1.htm |title=Presentation: Section Roazhon Pariz |publisher=Roazhon Celtic Kop |language=French |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref> The RCK makes no attempt to hide its chaotic and festive appearance. In 2003, a second group of ultras, the Breizh Stourmer (\"Breton Warriors\") was formed through a break with the RCK. The group was created around the idea of a small, strong core of supporters and chose to situate themselves on the opposite side of the RCK. The Breizh Stourmer has been accused by elements of the RCK for certain members holding extreme-right views.{{sfn|Keltz|2012|p=115}} Violent clashes between radical members of the two groups have occurred. The main rival of the RCK has, however, not been the Breizh Stourmer, but for many years, the Brigade Loire, a supporters' group of Rennes' rival club [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. The Breizh Stourmer has since dissolved. In 2008, a new group of supporters, the Unvez Kelt (UK) (\"Celtic Unity\"), was founded.

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s.

Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police, who were tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\". He calls this recording in particular \"incredibly speeded up\" and \"so out of time and out of tune but so filled with Stoned energy that it just transcended criticism\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0825626692|last=Dalton|first=David|authorlink=David Dalton (writer)|year=1972|title=Rolling Stones|publisher=Music Sales Corp}}</ref> However, according to ''[[Stereo Review]]''{{'}}s Steve Simels in 1977, the LP \"had the distinction of being the most poorly recorded live album in history\", until Jamaican musician [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s 1976 ''In Concert'', also produced by Oldham.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jimmy Cliff: In Concert - The Best of Jimmy Cliff|page=227|magazine=[[Stereo Review]]|volume=38|last=Simels|first=Steve}}</ref> In regards to the 1986 ABKCO CD, Mark Moses of ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' observes that \"considerable cleanup\" had been done to what \"has always been an embarrassment\" in the Stones' reputation as a live act, although this is not necessarily a good thing, as Jagger is further revealed to be \"annoyingly out-of-tune with the rest of the band\" on several cuts.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moses|first=Mark|year=1987|volume=37|issue=12|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]|page=84|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If You Want It!, More Hot Rocks}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alo bio 2010 Small.jpg|thumb|The production of [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] (pictured in 2010) is a major point of criticism for the album.]]\n\nLater reappraisals are also mixed. Reviewing for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] approves of the album's concept but finds the resulting release to be disappointing for reasons that may or may not have been the fault of the production team \u2013 he cites the poor sound quality and the dubbing of artificial crowd noise onto a few studio recordings as [[filler (media)|filler]].

With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police, who were tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

As a consequence, [[popular music]] acts were subsequently banned from performing at the Hall. According to the music journalist [[Fred Bronson]], \"the concert drove home the Stones' unpopularity with members of the [[ruling class]].\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|page=200|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|isbn=0823076776}}</ref>\n\nThe Stones' producer and manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], abandoned the original idea in response to this \"collective hysteria generated by the group, especially among teenagers, which threatened to degenerate into rioting\", as Margotin and Guesdon describe. Instead, he decided to select concert recordings from other sources and two older studio tracks, later [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] with crowd noise, to pass for an entirely live album that would still credit the Royal Albert Hall as the recorded venue.<ref name=\"Running\">{{cite book|last1=Margotin|first1=Phillippe|last2=Guesdon|first2=Jean-Michel|chapter=Got Live If You Want It!: A Live Album as Stopgap...|title=The Rolling Stones All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track|publisher=Running Press|year=2016|isbn=031631773X|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5eTCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT339#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2020|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colston Hall (geograph 2599803).jpg|thumb|[[Colston Hall]] in [[Bristol]] (in 2011), where the Stones were recorded on 7 October 1966 for the album]]\n\nThe recordings of \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", \"[[Get Off of My Cloud]]\", \"[[The Last Time (Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\" and \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\" were taken from the Stones' 1 October 1966 live performance at City Hall in Newcastle. Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

A mechanically hysterical audience is matched to a mechanically hysterical sound.\"<ref name=\"Pearlman\"/> He highlighted the LP's \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" as an exemplar of this aesthetic:\n\n{{quote|It's a mechanical conception and realization (like all metal songs) \u2013 with the instruments and Mick's voice densely organised into hard, sharp-edged planes of sound: a construction of aural surfaces and regular surfaced planes, a planar conception, the product of a mechanistic discipline, with an emphasis upon the geometrical organization of percussive sounds.<ref name=\"Pearlman\"/>}}\n\nWriting in ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]'' that same year, Peter Reilly was indifferent to the merits of the music and merely found the audio quality fair but \"echo-y\". The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\". He calls this recording in particular \"incredibly speeded up\" and \"so out of time and out of tune but so filled with Stoned energy that it just transcended criticism\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0825626692|last=Dalton|first=David|authorlink=David Dalton (writer)|year=1972|title=Rolling Stones|publisher=Music Sales Corp}}</ref> However, according to ''[[Stereo Review]]''{{'}}s Steve Simels in 1977, the LP \"had the distinction of being the most poorly recorded live album in history\", until Jamaican musician [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s 1976 ''In Concert'', also produced by Oldham.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jimmy Cliff: In Concert - The Best of Jimmy Cliff|page=227|magazine=[[Stereo Review]]|volume=38|last=Simels|first=Steve}}</ref> In regards to the 1986 ABKCO CD, Mark Moses of ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' observes that \"considerable cleanup\" had been done to what \"has always been an embarrassment\" in the Stones' reputation as a live act, although this is not necessarily a good thing, as Jagger is further revealed to be \"annoyingly out-of-tune with the rest of the band\" on several cuts.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moses|first=Mark|year=1987|volume=37|issue=12|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]|page=84|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If You Want It!, More Hot Rocks}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alo bio 2010 Small.jpg|thumb|The production of [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] (pictured in 2010) is a major point of criticism for the album.]]\n\nLater reappraisals are also mixed. Reviewing for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] approves of the album's concept but finds the resulting release to be disappointing for reasons that may or may not have been the fault of the production team \u2013 he cites the poor sound quality and the dubbing of artificial crowd noise onto a few studio recordings as [[filler (media)|filler]]. Unterberger concedes, however, that \"the album has its virtues as a historical document, with some extremely important caveats for anyone not old enough to recognise the inherent limitations in a live album of this vintage.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Havers echoes his observation of \"the limitations\" as well as the \"fascinating glimpse\" offered into hearing the Stones live at the time.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> In ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] writes of the 2002 ABCKO CD, \"We fight to hear the band amid a barrage of crowd screams \u2013 yes, the Stones as teen idols \u2013 but the band still manages a biting 'Under My Thumb.'\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> Margotin and Guesdon, in ''The Rolling Stones All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track'' (2016), acknowledge \"the screaming that blocked out the music\", but still consider the album \"a terrific document of the times, of the extraordinary, adrenaline-fueled, and often erotically charged relationship between the Stones and their fans\".<ref name=\"Running\"/> Critic [[Tom Hull (critic)|Tom Hull]] says of the record, \"All but their change-of-pace hit 'Lady Jane' are hard and sharp, including a couple of my favorites from the day.
