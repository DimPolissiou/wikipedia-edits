A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"].

May 12, 2005.</ref> Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for ''Vitalogy'', Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Gossard said, \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> [[Jack Irons]], the original drummer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said, \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making ''Vitalogy''. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Better_Man.ogg\n |title        = \"Better Man\"\n |description  = A sample of \"Better Man\", from ''Vitalogy''. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and rejected it from the band's previous album ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.

The lyrics for the song have been claimed by some to be about Kurt Cobain; however, Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train\".\n}}\nIn a 1995 interview, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jeff Gilbert described ''Vitalogy'' as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different.

The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded ''Vitalogy'' while touring behind its previous album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date.\n\nThe album was first released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], followed by a release on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until [[Jack White]]'s 2014 album ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.<ref name=\"billboard6-18-2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6121606/jack-white-lazaretto-debuts-billboard-200-sets-vinyl-sales-record |title=Jack White's 'Lazaretto' Debuts at No. 1, Sets Vinyl Sales Record |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> Upon its CD release, ''Vitalogy'' became the second-fastest selling album in history, only behind the band's previous release ''Vs.'', selling 877,000 copies in its first week and went multi-platinum quickly.<ref name=\"latimes12-15-1994\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/entertainment/ca-9311_1_pearl-jam |title=Vitalogy' Makes for a Real Pearl Jam of a Seller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Philips |first=Chuck |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=December 15, 1994}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its [[Vs. Tour]] and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Tremor Christ]]\" and \"[[Nothingman]]\".<ref name=\"musician\">Garbarini, Vic. \"Mother of Pearl\".

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, \"''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] said that \"communication was at an all-time low\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] stated that the communication problems started once guitarist [[Stone Gossard]] stopped acting as the band's mediator.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> According to Gossard, ''Vitalogy'' was the first album in which lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] made the final decisions.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band.<ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 22, 1996.</ref> Gossard said that the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\"<ref name=\"musician\"/> During the production of ''Vitalogy'', lead guitarist [[Mike McCready]] went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/><ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\nDrums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"]. TwoFeetThick.com. May 12, 2005.</ref> Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for ''Vitalogy'', Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Gossard said, \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> [[Jack Irons]], the original drummer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said, \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making ''Vitalogy''. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Better_Man.ogg\n |title        = \"Better Man\"\n |description  = A sample of \"Better Man\", from ''Vitalogy''. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and rejected it from the band's previous album ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.

The lyrics for the song have been claimed by some to be about Kurt Cobain; however, Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train\".\n}}\nIn a 1995 interview, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jeff Gilbert described ''Vitalogy'' as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more [[Punk rock|punk]] feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, \"''Vitalogy'' is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\"<ref name=\"guitar world\"/>\n\n[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|title=''Vitalogy'' \u2013 Pearl Jam|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vitalogy-mw0000121446|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}</ref> He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop,<ref name=\"Marks\">Marks, Craig. \"Let's Get Lost\".

Vedder said, \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\"<ref name=\"Marks\"/> The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\",<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album.

He said, \"''Vitalogy'' marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance.\" He added that \"despite its musical advances, ''Vitalogy'' leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' writer [[Jim DeRogatis]] gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting.

(Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'', in three formats: an Expanded Version, a three-CD Deluxe Edition and a Limited Edition Collector's Boxed Set. The Expanded Version will feature three bonus tracks: the previously unreleased guitar/organ-only mix of \"[[Better Man (Pearl Jam song)|Better Man]]\"; a previously unreleased alternate take of \"[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]\" from the Vitalogy session (recorded by Brendan O'Brien); and a previously unreleased demo version of \"[[Nothingman]]\", taken from the original DAT (recorded at John and Stu's in Seattle on October 14, 1993, featuring [[Richard Stuverud]] on drums). The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of ''Vitalogy'' and ''Vs.'' with their bonus tracks and a copy of Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pearljam.com/news/vs-and-vitalogy-20th-anniversary-editions|title=''Vs.'' and ''Vitalogy'' 20th Anniversary Editions|publisher=pearljam.com|accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe original title for the album was ''Life''. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.</ref> Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour.

The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane.

The mediator crosses the outer cell [[lipid membrane]]s and [[bacterial outer membrane]]; then, it begins to liberate electrons from the electron transport chain that normally would be taken up by oxygen or other intermediates.\n\nThe now-reduced mediator exits the cell laden with electrons that it transfers to an electrode; this electrode becomes the anode. The release of the electrons recycles the mediator to its original oxidized state, ready to repeat the process. '''This can happen only under anaerobic conditions'''; if oxygen is present, it will collect the electrons, as it has greater [[electronegativity]].\n\nIn MFC operation, the anode is the terminal electron acceptor recognized by bacteria in the anodic chamber. Therefore, the microbial activity is strongly dependent on the anode's redox potential. A [[Michaelis-Menten]] curve was obtained between the anodic potential and the power output of an [[acetate]]-driven MFC. A critical anodic potential seems to provide maximum power output.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es8003969 |pmid=18546730 |title=Affinity of Microbial Fuel Cell Biofilm for the Anodic Potential |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=3828\u201334 |year=2008 |last1=Cheng |first1=Ka Yu |last2=Ho |first2=Goen |last3=Cord-Ruwisch |first3=Ralf}}</ref>\n\nPotential mediators include natural red, methylene blue, thionine, and resorufin.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bit.260250219 |pmid=18548670 |title=Anodic reactions in microbial fuel cells |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=559\u201368 |year=1983 |last1=Bennetto |first1=H.

In order to turn this current into usable electricity, exoelectrogens have to be accommodated in a fuel cell.\n\nThe mediator and a micro-organism such as yeast, are mixed together in a solution to which is added a substrate such as [[glucose]]. This mixture is placed in a sealed chamber to stop oxygen entering, thus forcing the micro-organism to undertake [[anaerobic respiration]]. An electrode is placed in the solution to act as the anode.\n\nIn the second chamber of the MFC is another solution and the positively charged cathode. It is the equivalent of the oxygen sink at the end of the electron transport chain, external to the biological cell. The solution is an [[oxidizing agent]] that picks up the electrons at the cathode. As with the electron chain in the yeast cell, this could be a variety of molecules such as oxygen, although a more convenient option is a solid oxidizing agent, which requires less volume.\n\nConnecting the two electrodes is a wire (or other electrically conductive path). Completing the circuit and connecting the two chambers is a salt bridge or ion-exchange membrane. This last feature allows the protons produced, as described in ''{{EquationNote|Eqt. 1}},'' to pass from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber.\n\nThe reduced mediator carries electrons from the cell to the electrode. Here the mediator is oxidized as it deposits the electrons. These then flow across the wire to the second electrode, which acts as an electron sink. From here they pass to an oxidizing material. Also the hydrogen ions/protons are moved from the anode to the cathode via a proton exchange membrane such as [[nafion]]. They will move across to the lower concentration gradient and be combined with the oxygen but to do this they need an electron. This forms current and the hydrogen is used sustaining the concentration gradient.\n\nAlgae Biomass has been observed to give high energy when used as substrates in microbial fuel cell.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.067 |pmid=23584037 |title=Enhanced electricity generation by using algae biomass and activated sludge in microbial fuel cell |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=456-457 |pages=91\u20134 |year=2013 |last1=Rashid |first1=Naim |last2=Cui |first2=Yu-Feng |last3=Saif Ur Rehman |first3=Muhammad |last4=Han |first4=Jong-In}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Renewable energy}}\n*[[Biobattery]]\n*[[Cable bacteria]]\n*[[Dark fermentation]]\n*[[Electrohydrogenesis]]\n*[[Electromethanogenesis]]\n*[[Fermentative hydrogen production]]\n*[[Glossary of fuel cell terms]]\n*[[Hydrogen hypothesis]]\n*[[Hydrogen technologies]]\n*[[Photofermentation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n|author= The Biotech/Life Sciences Portal\n|date= 20 Jan 2006\n|title= Impressive idea \u2013 self-sufficient fuel cells\n|url= http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/wissenschaft/archiv_2006/index.html?lang=en&artikelid=/artikel/03009/index.html\n|publisher= Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg GmbH\n|accessdate= 2011-02-07\n|url-status= dead\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035054/http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/wissenschaft/archiv_2006/index.html?lang=en&artikelid=%2Fartikel%2F03009%2Findex.html\n|archivedate= 2011-07-21\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Liu H, Cheng S, Logan BE |year=2005\n|title=Production of electricity from acetate or butyrate using a single-chamber microbial fuel cell\n|journal=Environ Sci Technol\n|volume=32\n|issue=2\n|pages=658\u201362\n|doi=10.1021/es048927c\n|pmid=15707069\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n|author1=Rabaey, K. |author2=W.

The mediator crosses the outer cell [[lipid membrane]]s and [[bacterial outer membrane]]; then, it begins to liberate electrons from the electron transport chain that normally would be taken up by oxygen or other intermediates.\n\nThe now-reduced mediator exits the cell laden with electrons that it transfers to an electrode; this electrode becomes the anode. The release of the electrons recycles the mediator to its original oxidized state, ready to repeat the process. '''This can happen only under anaerobic conditions'''; if oxygen is present, it will collect the electrons, as it has greater [[electronegativity]].\n\nIn MFC operation, the anode is the terminal electron acceptor recognized by bacteria in the anodic chamber. Therefore, the microbial activity is strongly dependent on the anode's redox potential. A [[Michaelis-Menten]] curve was obtained between the anodic potential and the power output of an [[acetate]]-driven MFC. A critical anodic potential seems to provide maximum power output.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es8003969 |pmid=18546730 |title=Affinity of Microbial Fuel Cell Biofilm for the Anodic Potential |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=3828\u201334 |year=2008 |last1=Cheng |first1=Ka Yu |last2=Ho |first2=Goen |last3=Cord-Ruwisch |first3=Ralf}}</ref>\n\nPotential mediators include natural red, methylene blue, thionine, and resorufin.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bit.260250219 |pmid=18548670 |title=Anodic reactions in microbial fuel cells |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=559\u201368 |year=1983 |last1=Bennetto |first1=H.

In order to turn this current into usable electricity, exoelectrogens have to be accommodated in a fuel cell.\n\nThe mediator and a micro-organism such as yeast, are mixed together in a solution to which is added a substrate such as [[glucose]]. This mixture is placed in a sealed chamber to stop oxygen entering, thus forcing the micro-organism to undertake [[anaerobic respiration]]. An electrode is placed in the solution to act as the anode.\n\nIn the second chamber of the MFC is another solution and the positively charged cathode. It is the equivalent of the oxygen sink at the end of the electron transport chain, external to the biological cell. The solution is an [[oxidizing agent]] that picks up the electrons at the cathode. As with the electron chain in the yeast cell, this could be a variety of molecules such as oxygen, although a more convenient option is a solid oxidizing agent, which requires less volume.\n\nConnecting the two electrodes is a wire (or other electrically conductive path). Completing the circuit and connecting the two chambers is a salt bridge or ion-exchange membrane. This last feature allows the protons produced, as described in ''{{EquationNote|Eqt. 1}},'' to pass from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber.\n\nThe reduced mediator carries electrons from the cell to the electrode. Here the mediator is oxidized as it deposits the electrons. These then flow across the wire to the second electrode, which acts as an electron sink. From here they pass to an oxidizing material. Also the hydrogen ions/protons are moved from the anode to the cathode via a proton exchange membrane such as [[nafion]]. They will move across to the lower concentration gradient and be combined with the oxygen but to do this they need an electron. This forms current and the hydrogen is used sustaining the concentration gradient.\n\nAlgae Biomass has been observed to give high energy when used as substrates in microbial fuel cell.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.067 |pmid=23584037 |title=Enhanced electricity generation by using algae biomass and activated sludge in microbial fuel cell |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=456-457 |pages=91\u20134 |year=2013 |last1=Rashid |first1=Naim |last2=Cui |first2=Yu-Feng |last3=Saif Ur Rehman |first3=Muhammad |last4=Han |first4=Jong-In}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Renewable energy}}\n*[[Biobattery]]\n*[[Cable bacteria]]\n*[[Dark fermentation]]\n*[[Electrohydrogenesis]]\n*[[Electromethanogenesis]]\n*[[Fermentative hydrogen production]]\n*[[Glossary of fuel cell terms]]\n*[[Hydrogen hypothesis]]\n*[[Hydrogen technologies]]\n*[[Photofermentation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n|author= The Biotech/Life Sciences Portal\n|date= 20 Jan 2006\n|title= Impressive idea \u2013 self-sufficient fuel cells\n|url= http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/wissenschaft/archiv_2006/index.html?lang=en&artikelid=/artikel/03009/index.html\n|publisher= Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg GmbH\n|accessdate= 2011-02-07\n|url-status= dead\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035054/http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/wissenschaft/archiv_2006/index.html?lang=en&artikelid=%2Fartikel%2F03009%2Findex.html\n|archivedate= 2011-07-21\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Liu H, Cheng S, Logan BE |year=2005\n|title=Production of electricity from acetate or butyrate using a single-chamber microbial fuel cell\n|journal=Environ Sci Technol\n|volume=32\n|issue=2\n|pages=658\u201362\n|doi=10.1021/es048927c\n|pmid=15707069\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n|author1=Rabaey, K. |author2=W.

Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in [[Mexico]], [[European countries]], some areas of Canada, and in all of the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from [[Kleptoparasite|scavenged carcasses from predators]] as an easy food source when other food sources decline.\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Hibernation===\nGrizzlies hibernate for 5\u20137 months each year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/grizzly-bear.aspx|publisher= National Wildlife Federation|title=Hibernation in grizzly bears}}</ref> except where the climate is warm, as the [[California grizzly]] did not hibernate.<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\" /> During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/grizzly-bear/ |title=Grizzly Bear |publisher=Animal Fact Guide |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation.

The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defence of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an [[elk]] killed by wolves.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gunther |first=K.

As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).<ref>{{cite news|title=Yellowstone wolves' return means more grizzly food |url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Yellowstone-wolves-return-means-more-grizzly-food-4701979.php |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the wolves were acting in defence.<ref>{{cite web |title=How wolves interact with other predators |url=http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm |publisher=wolfbehavior|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228164448/http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm |archivedate=28 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Potential Interactions Between Bears & Wolves |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearwolves.htm |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n====Grizzlies and big cats====\n[[North American cougar|Cougar]]s generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with [[cougar]]s than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear.

When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree.\n\nBlack bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself.

The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs.   The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important.  [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]], British Columbia is a community that demonstrates the success of this approach.  In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town.

Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the [[Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary]] located along the north coast of British Columbia; at {{convert|44,300|ha}} in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/khutzeymateen|title=Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary|website=env.gov.bc.ca}}</ref> When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.\n\nThe Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on [[Grouse Mountain]] in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206165858/http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archivedate=6 February 2010 |title=Wildlife and Education: Refuge for Endangered Wildlife |year=2009 |publisher= Grouse Mountain: The Peak of Vancouver |accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.\n\nAnother factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered.<ref name=\"KrebsCJ\">{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C.

Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in [[Mexico]], [[European countries]], some areas of Canada, and in all of the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from [[Kleptoparasite|scavenged carcasses from predators]] as an easy food source when other food sources decline.\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Hibernation===\nGrizzlies hibernate for 5\u20137 months each year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/grizzly-bear.aspx|publisher= National Wildlife Federation|title=Hibernation in grizzly bears}}</ref> except where the climate is warm, as the [[California grizzly]] did not hibernate.<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\" /> During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/grizzly-bear/ |title=Grizzly Bear |publisher=Animal Fact Guide |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation.

As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).<ref>{{cite news|title=Yellowstone wolves' return means more grizzly food |url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Yellowstone-wolves-return-means-more-grizzly-food-4701979.php |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the wolves were acting in defence.<ref>{{cite web |title=How wolves interact with other predators |url=http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm |publisher=wolfbehavior|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228164448/http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm |archivedate=28 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Potential Interactions Between Bears & Wolves |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearwolves.htm |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n====Grizzlies and big cats====\n[[North American cougar|Cougar]]s generally give the bears a wide berth.

When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree.\n\nBlack bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself.

The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs.   The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important.

In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town.

Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the [[Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary]] located along the north coast of British Columbia; at {{convert|44,300|ha}} in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/khutzeymateen|title=Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary|website=env.gov.bc.ca}}</ref> When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.\n\nThe Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on [[Grouse Mountain]] in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206165858/http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archivedate=6 February 2010 |title=Wildlife and Education: Refuge for Endangered Wildlife |year=2009 |publisher= Grouse Mountain: The Peak of Vancouver |accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.\n\nAnother factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered.<ref name=\"KrebsCJ\">{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C.
