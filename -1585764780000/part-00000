{"title_page": "Townshend Acts", "text_new": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n[[File:CharlesTownshend.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Townshend]] spearheaded the laws, but died before their detrimental effects became apparent.]]\n{{American Revolution sidebar}}\n\nThe '''Townshend Acts''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|a\u028a|n|z|\u0259n|d}}) were a series of British acts of Parliament passed during 1767 and 1768 relating to the British colonies in America. They are named after [[Charles Townshend]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \"Townshend Acts\", but five are often listed:<ref>Dickerson (''Navigation Acts'', 195\u201395) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was \"officially a part of the Potato Acts\" (\"Townshend Acts\", 128).</ref>\n* [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|'''The New York Restraining Act 1767''']] passed on June 5, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Revenue Act 1767|'''The Revenue Act 1767''']] passed on June 26, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Indemnity Act 1767|'''The Indemnity Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767|'''The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768|'''The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768''']] passed on July 6, 1768\n\nThe purposes of the acts were to:\n* raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain\n* create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations\n* punish the [[Province of New York]] for failing to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]]\n* establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 126.</ref>\n\nThe Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, which eventually resulted in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. They placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend's response to the failure of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in [[John Dickinson]]'s ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'' and in the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]]. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143.</ref> In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under [[Frederick, Lord North]]. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the [[Declaratory Act of 1766]]. The British government continued to tax the American colonies [[No taxation without representation|without providing representation in Parliament]]. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in 1772. The Townshend Acts' taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the [[Tea Act of 1773]], and this led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 in which the people of Boston destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the [[Intolerable Acts]] of 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, launching the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of [[British America]]. Previously, through the [[Trade and Navigation Acts]], Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 206.</ref>\n\nThe Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had \"[[virtual representation]]\", a concept the Americans rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard W. Levy|title=Seasoned Judgments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7lKq0dfs54C&pg=PA303|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=303}}</ref> This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention after Parliament's passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765]]. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue.\n\nImplicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 10.</ref> Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the [[Declaratory Act]], which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 21\u201325.</ref>\n\n==The five Townshend Acts==\n\n===The New York Restraining Act 1767===\nThis was the first of the five acts, passed on June 5, 1767. It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they agreed to comply with the [[Quartering Acts#Quartering Act 1765|Quartering Act 1765]], which required them to pay for and provide housing, food and supplies for British troops in the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act because it amounted to taxation without representation, since they had no representatives in Parliament. Further, New York and the other colonies did not believe British soldiers were any longer necessary in the colonies, since the [[French and Indian War]] had come to an end. However, New York reluctantly agreed to pay for at least some of the soldiers' needs as they understood they were going to be punished by Parliament unless they acted. The New York Restraining Act was never implemented because the New York Assembly acted in time.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/new-york-restraining-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Revenue Act 1767===\nThis was the second of the five acts, passed on June 26, 1767. It placed taxes on glass, lead, painters' colors, and paper. It gave customs officials broad authority to enforce the taxes and punish smugglers through the use of \"[[writs of assistance]]\", general warrants that could be used to search private property for smuggled goods. There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial, since the right to be secure in one's private property was an established right in Britain.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/revenue-act-of-1767-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Indemnity Act 1767===\nThis act was the (joint) third act, passed on June 29, 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below). '[[Indemnity]]' means 'security or protection against a loss or other financial burden'.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/indemnity</ref> The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the [[British East India Company]] when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. At the time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made, and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/indemnity-act-of-1767-text.html</ref> This followed from the principle of [[mercantilism]] in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.<ref>http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/market_to_market/pages/mercantilism_imports_and_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] was one of England's largest companies, but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company's tea less than tea that was smuggled via [[Holland]]. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea.<ref>http://www.tea-party-boston.com/the-indemnity-act</ref>\n\n===The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767===\nThis act was passed on June 29, 1767 also. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The Board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant. Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs and officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the [[Boston Massacre]].<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/commissioners-of-customs-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768===\nThis was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until July 6, 1768, a full year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues. The Act was not passed by Parliament, but by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, with the approval of the King.\n\nThe Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave Royal naval courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favorable outcome using a local judge and jury. The Vice-Admiralty Court Act added three new royal admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and who were awarded 5% of any fine the judge levied<ref>https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/01/vice-admiralty-courts-and-writs-of-assistance/</ref> when they found someone guilty. The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/vice-admiralty-court-act-of-1768-text.html</ref>\n\n==Townshend's program==\n\n===Raising revenue===\nThe first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767.<ref>The Revenue Act 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act 1767.</ref> This act represented the [[Chatham ministry]]'s new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9.</ref> The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \"internal\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \"external\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.<ref name=\"Reid33+\">Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33\u201339.</ref> With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 19\u201320.</ref> These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 127.</ref>\n\nThe colonists' objection to \"internal\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"external\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Reid33+\" /> \"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33.</ref> The Townshend Revenue Act received the [[royal assent]] on 29 June 1767.<ref name=\"Thomas31\">Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 31.</ref> There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.<ref name=\"Thomas31\" />\n\nThe Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767,<ref>The Indemnity Act was 7 Geo. III ch. 56; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 269n20. It is also known as the Tea Act 1767; Jensen, ''Founding'', 435.</ref> which was intended to make the tea of the [[British East India Company]] more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 196.</ref> The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.<ref>Labaree,''Tea Party'', 21.</ref> The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of [[writs of assistance]], or general [[search warrant]]s, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 29, 135n24.</ref>\n\nThe original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 22\u201323.</ref> Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 23\u201325.</ref> Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the \"[[power of the purse]]\"<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 260.</ref> away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, \"Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.\"<ref>Miller, ''Origins'', 255.</ref>\n\nSome members of Parliament objected because Townshend's plan was expected to generate only \u00a340,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref> According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend's \"aims were political rather than financial\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref>\n\n===American Board of Customs Commissioners===\nTo better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the [[British Board of Customs]].<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47.</ref> The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 33</ref> Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 130.</ref> The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, \"The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.\"<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 199.</ref>\n\nThe American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues:\n:merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it. Such \"customs racketeering\" was, in the view of colonial merchants, essentially legalized piracy.<ref>Peter Andreas, ''Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America'' (2012) p 34</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] says:\n:In the establishment of this American Board of Customs Commissioners, Americans saw the extension of England's corrupt system of officeholding to America. As Professor Dickerson has shown, the Commissioners were indeed corrupt. They engaged in extensive \"customs racketeering\" and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between England and the colonies: it was on their request that troops were sent to Boston; The Boston Massacre took place before their headquarters; the \"Gaspee\" was operating under their orders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Challenge of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y4XAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|year=1978|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=104\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Doug Krehbiel argues:\n:Disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the British government. Vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt\u2014customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items, thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels, and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful. Writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused. John Hancock, the wealthy New England merchant, had his ship \"Liberty\" seized in 1768 on a false charge, incensing the colonists. Charges against Hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in Britain.<ref>Doug Krehbiel, \"British Empire and the Atlantic World,\" in Paul Finkelman, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the New American Nation'' (2005) 1:228</ref>\n\nAnother measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 8 Geo. III ch. 22].</ref> Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 34\u201335.</ref> Before this act, there was just one [[vice admiralty court]] in North America, located in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Boston, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have [[jury|juries]], was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.\n\nTownshend also faced the problem of what to do about the [[New York Provincial Assembly]], which had refused to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Act]] because its members saw the act's financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134.</ref> The New York Restraining Act,<ref>7 Geo. III ch. 59. Also known as the New York Suspending Act; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 296.</ref> which according to historian Robert Chaffin was \"officially a part of the Townshend Acts\",<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128.</ref> suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nTownshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, \"The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.\"<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 131.</ref> The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 48; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 76.</ref> Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on September 4, 1767.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson Farmer Letters.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Dickinson|Dickinson's]] ''Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania'']]\nThe most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] entitled \"[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]\", which began appearing in December 1767.<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\">Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 132.</ref> Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies,<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\"/> Dickinson argued that there was no difference between \"internal\" and \"external\" taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 50.</ref> Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low, since this would set a dangerous precedent.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nDickinson sent a copy of his \"Letters\" to [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], informing Otis that \"whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54. Dickinson's letter to Otis was dated December 5, 1767.</ref> The [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54.</ref> Upon receipt of the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], other colonies also sent petitions to the king.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 84; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54\u201357.</ref> Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament's sovereignty over them.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 85, 111\u201312.</ref> Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 112.</ref>\n\nIn Great Britain, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 81; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 56.</ref>\n\n===Boycotts===\n[[File:Houghton 42-5288 - non-importation agreement, 1767.jpg|thumb|Non-importation agreement, dated October 1767, signed by Bostonians including [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMerchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 57\u201358.</ref> In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by [[George Washington]] and [[George Mason]]. When the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] passed a resolution stating that Parliament had no right to tax Virginians without their consent, Governor [[Lord Botetourt]] dissolved the assembly. The members met at [[Raleigh Tavern]] and adopted a boycott agreement known as the \"Association\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 59.</ref>\n\nThe non-importation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped. British exports to the colonies declined by 38 percent in 1769, but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 157.</ref> The boycott movement began to fail by 1770, and came to an end in 1771.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 138.</ref>\n\n===Unrest in Boston===\n[[File:Boston 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere]]'s engraving of British troops landing in [[Boston]] in 1768|alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

Commodore [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] complied by sending the fifty-gun warship [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']], which arrived in [[Boston Harbor]] in May 1768.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63.</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1768, customs officials seized the ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'', a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant [[John Hancock]], on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of the ''Romney'' had been [[impressment|impressing]] local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Castle William]] for protection. With [[John Adams]] serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a [[Vice admiralty court|vice-admiralty court]], but the charges were eventually dropped.<ref>\"Notorious Smuggler\", 236\u201346; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63\u201365.</ref>\n\nGiven the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard to try to find evidence of [[treason]] in Boston.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 109.</ref> Parliament had determined that the [[Treason Act 1543]] was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 296\u201397.</ref> The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 69.</ref>\n\nEven before the ''Liberty'' riot, Hillsborough had decided to send troops to Boston. On 8 June 1768, he instructed General [[Thomas Gage]], [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]], to send \"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\", although he conceded that this might lead to \"consequences not easily foreseen\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 82; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 75; Jensen, ''Founding'', 290.</ref> Hillsborough suggested that Gage might send one regiment to Boston, but the ''Liberty'' incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 125.</ref>\n\nPeople in Massachusetts learned in September 1768 that troops were on the way.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 92.</ref> [[Samuel Adams]] organized an emergency, extralegal [[Massachusetts Convention of Towns|convention of towns]] and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of Boston, but on 1 October 1768, the first of four regiments of the [[British Army]] began disembarking in Boston, and the Customs Commissioners returned to town.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76.</ref> The \"[[Journal of Occurrences]]\", an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of Boston, apparently with some exaggeration.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76\u201377.</ref> Tensions rose after [[Christopher Seider]], a Boston teenager, was killed by a customs employee on 22 February 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 77\u201378.</ref> Although British soldiers were not involved in that incident, resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed, resulting in the killing of five civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 5 March 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 78\u201379.</ref> After the incident, the troops were withdrawn to Castle William.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 81.</ref>\n\n==Partial repeal==\nOn the 5th of March 1770\u2014 the same day as the Boston Massacre although news traveled slowly at the time, and neither side of the Atlantic were aware of this coincidence\u2014[[Lord North]], the new Prime Minister, presented a motion in the House of Commons that called for partial repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act.<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\">Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 71.</ref> Although some in Parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act, North disagreed, arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert \"the right of taxing the Americans\".<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\"/> After debate, the Repeal Act<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 10 Geo.

They are named after [[Charles Townshend]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \"Townshend Acts\", but five are often listed:<ref>Dickerson (''Navigation Acts'', 195\u201395) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was \"officially a part of the Potato Acts\" (\"Townshend Acts\", 128).</ref>\n* [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|'''The New York Restraining Act 1767''']] passed on June 5, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Revenue Act 1767|'''The Revenue Act 1767''']] passed on June 26, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Indemnity Act 1767|'''The Indemnity Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767|'''The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768|'''The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768''']] passed on July 6, 1768\n\nThe purposes of the acts were to:\n* raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain\n* create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations\n* punish the [[Province of New York]] for failing to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]]\n* establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 126.</ref>\n\nThe Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, which eventually resulted in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. They placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend's response to the failure of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in [[John Dickinson]]'s ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'' and in the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]]. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143.</ref> In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under [[Frederick, Lord North]]. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the [[Declaratory Act of 1766]]. The British government continued to tax the American colonies [[No taxation without representation|without providing representation in Parliament]]. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in 1772. The Townshend Acts' taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the [[Tea Act of 1773]], and this led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 in which Bostonians destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the [[Intolerable Acts]] of 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, launching the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of [[British America]]. Previously, through the [[Trade and Navigation Acts]], Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 206.</ref>\n\nThe Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had \"[[virtual representation]]\", a concept the Americans rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard W. Levy|title=Seasoned Judgments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7lKq0dfs54C&pg=PA303|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=303}}</ref> This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention after Parliament's passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765]]. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue.\n\nImplicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 10.</ref> Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the [[Declaratory Act]], which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 21\u201325.</ref>\n\n==The five Townshend Acts==\n\n===The New York Restraining Act 1767===\nThis was the first of the five acts, passed on June 5, 1767. It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they agreed to comply with the [[Quartering Acts#Quartering Act 1765|Quartering Act 1765]], which required them to pay for and provide housing, food and supplies for British troops in the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act because it amounted to taxation without representation, since they had no representatives in Parliament. Further, New York and the other colonies did not believe British soldiers were any longer necessary in the colonies, since the [[French and Indian War]] had come to an end. However, New York reluctantly agreed to pay for at least some of the soldiers' needs as they understood they were going to be punished by Parliament unless they acted. The New York Restraining Act was never implemented because the New York Assembly acted in time.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/new-york-restraining-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Revenue Act 1767===\nThis was the second of the five acts, passed on June 26, 1767. It placed taxes on glass, lead, painters' colors, and paper. It gave customs officials broad authority to enforce the taxes and punish smugglers through the use of \"[[writs of assistance]]\", general warrants that could be used to search private property for smuggled goods. There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial, since the right to be secure in one's private property was an established right in Britain.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/revenue-act-of-1767-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Indemnity Act 1767===\nThis act was the (joint) third act, passed on June 29, 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below). '[[Indemnity]]' means 'security or protection against a loss or other financial burden'.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/indemnity</ref> The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the [[British East India Company]] when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. At the time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made, and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/indemnity-act-of-1767-text.html</ref> This followed from the principle of [[mercantilism]] in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.<ref>http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/market_to_market/pages/mercantilism_imports_and_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] was one of England's largest companies, but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company's tea less than tea that was smuggled via [[Holland]]. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea.<ref>http://www.tea-party-boston.com/the-indemnity-act</ref>\n\n===The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767===\nThis act was passed on June 29, 1767 also. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The Board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant. Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs and officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the [[Boston Massacre]].<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/commissioners-of-customs-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768===\nThis was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until July 6, 1768, a full year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues. The Act was not passed by Parliament, but by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, with the approval of the King.\n\nThe Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave Royal naval courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favorable outcome using a local judge and jury. The Vice-Admiralty Court Act added three new royal admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and who were awarded 5% of any fine the judge levied<ref>https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/01/vice-admiralty-courts-and-writs-of-assistance/</ref> when they found someone guilty. The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/vice-admiralty-court-act-of-1768-text.html</ref>\n\n==Townshend's program==\n\n===Raising revenue===\nThe first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767.<ref>The Revenue Act 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act 1767.</ref> This act represented the [[Chatham ministry]]'s new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9.</ref> The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \"internal\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \"external\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.<ref name=\"Reid33+\">Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33\u201339.</ref> With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 19\u201320.</ref> These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 127.</ref>\n\nThe colonists' objection to \"internal\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"external\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Reid33+\" /> \"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33.</ref> The Townshend Revenue Act received the [[royal assent]] on 29 June 1767.<ref name=\"Thomas31\">Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 31.</ref> There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.<ref name=\"Thomas31\" />\n\nThe Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767,<ref>The Indemnity Act was 7 Geo. III ch. 56; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 269n20. It is also known as the Tea Act 1767; Jensen, ''Founding'', 435.</ref> which was intended to make the tea of the [[British East India Company]] more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 196.</ref> The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.<ref>Labaree,''Tea Party'', 21.</ref> The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of [[writs of assistance]], or general [[search warrant]]s, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 29, 135n24.</ref>\n\nThe original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 22\u201323.</ref> Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 23\u201325.</ref> Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the \"[[power of the purse]]\"<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 260.</ref> away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, \"Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.\"<ref>Miller, ''Origins'', 255.</ref>\n\nSome members of Parliament objected because Townshend's plan was expected to generate only \u00a340,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref> According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend's \"aims were political rather than financial\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref>\n\n===American Board of Customs Commissioners===\nTo better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the [[British Board of Customs]].<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47.</ref> The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 33</ref> Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 130.</ref> The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, \"The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.\"<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 199.</ref>\n\nThe American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues:\n:merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it. Such \"customs racketeering\" was, in the view of colonial merchants, essentially legalized piracy.<ref>Peter Andreas, ''Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America'' (2012) p 34</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] says:\n:In the establishment of this American Board of Customs Commissioners, Americans saw the extension of England's corrupt system of officeholding to America. As Professor Dickerson has shown, the Commissioners were indeed corrupt. They engaged in extensive \"customs racketeering\" and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between England and the colonies: it was on their request that troops were sent to Boston; The Boston Massacre took place before their headquarters; the \"Gaspee\" was operating under their orders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Challenge of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y4XAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|year=1978|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=104\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Doug Krehbiel argues:\n:Disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the British government. Vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt\u2014customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items, thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels, and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful. Writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused. John Hancock, the wealthy New England merchant, had his ship \"Liberty\" seized in 1768 on a false charge, incensing the colonists. Charges against Hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in Britain.<ref>Doug Krehbiel, \"British Empire and the Atlantic World,\" in Paul Finkelman, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the New American Nation'' (2005) 1:228</ref>\n\nAnother measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 8 Geo. III ch. 22].</ref> Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 34\u201335.</ref> Before this act, there was just one [[vice admiralty court]] in North America, located in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Boston, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have [[jury|juries]], was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.\n\nTownshend also faced the problem of what to do about the [[New York Provincial Assembly]], which had refused to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Act]] because its members saw the act's financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134.</ref> The New York Restraining Act,<ref>7 Geo. III ch. 59. Also known as the New York Suspending Act; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 296.</ref> which according to historian Robert Chaffin was \"officially a part of the Townshend Acts\",<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128.</ref> suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nTownshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, \"The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.\"<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 131.</ref> The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 48; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 76.</ref> Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on September 4, 1767.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson Farmer Letters.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Dickinson|Dickinson's]] ''Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania'']]\nThe most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] entitled \"[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]\", which began appearing in December 1767.<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\">Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 132.</ref> Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies,<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\"/> Dickinson argued that there was no difference between \"internal\" and \"external\" taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 50.</ref> Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low, since this would set a dangerous precedent.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nDickinson sent a copy of his \"Letters\" to [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], informing Otis that \"whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54. Dickinson's letter to Otis was dated December 5, 1767.</ref> The [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54.</ref> Upon receipt of the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], other colonies also sent petitions to the king.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 84; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54\u201357.</ref> Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament's sovereignty over them.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 85, 111\u201312.</ref> Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 112.</ref>\n\nIn Great Britain, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 81; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 56.</ref>\n\n===Boycotts===\n[[File:Houghton 42-5288 - non-importation agreement, 1767.jpg|thumb|Non-importation agreement, dated October 1767, signed by Bostonians including [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMerchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 57\u201358.</ref> In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by [[George Washington]] and [[George Mason]].

The revenue-producing tea levy, the American Board of Customs and, most important, the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained. In fact, the modification of the Townshend Duties Act was scarcely any change at all.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 140.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Townshend duty on tea was retained when the 1773 Tea Act was passed, which allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies. The Boston Tea Party soon followed, which set the stage for the American Revolution.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Chaffin, Robert J. \"The Townshend Acts crisis, 1767\u20131770\".

Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human influenza, it is called [[Zoonosis|zoonotic swine flu]] or a variant virus. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.

Influenza viruses that are normally found in swine are known as swine influenza viruses (SIVs). \nThe known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, [[H1N2]], [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]] and [[H2N3]]. Pigs can also become infected with the H4N6 and H9N2 subtypes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nSwine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human influenza, it is called [[Zoonosis|zoonotic swine flu]] or a variant virus. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. The meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked.\n\nPigs experimentally infected with the strain of swine flu that caused the [[2009 flu pandemic|human pandemic of 2009\u201310]] showed clinical signs of flu within four days, and the virus spread to other uninfected pigs housed with the infected ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090709201847.htm |title=Humans May Give Swine Flu To Pigs In New Twist To Pandemic |website=Sciencedaily.com |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Notable incidents==\n\n===Spanish flu===\n{{Main|1918 flu pandemic}}\nThe [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]], also known as ''la grippe,'' ''La Gripe Espa\u00f1ola'', or ''La Pesadilla'', was an unusually severe and deadly [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[avian influenza]], a [[virus|viral]] [[infection|infectious]] [[disease]], that killed some 17<ref name=Spreeuwenberg>{{cite journal |last1=P.

The 1972 magazine story was illustrated by [[Jack Gaughan]]<ref name=isfdb-if/> and the 1990 collection by [[Frank Kelly Freas]].<ref name=isfdb/>{{efn|name=isfdb-more}}\n\nThe Heechee originated <ref>Victoria B. Denton, ''Recent History of Sceince Fiction\", p. 46, 79</ref> as a plot device enabling Pohl to give a plausible reason for humans to make the effort of colonizing the inhospitable planet that space probes had proven [[Venus]] to be. In \"The Merchants of Venus\", the Heechee (a name given to them by humans since nobody knows what they called themselves) are nowhere to be found, and humans know of them only from their advanced artifacts.\n\nThe first evidence comes with the discovery of tunnels constructed under the Venusian surface, each tunnel distinguished by a mysterious light-emitting [[cobalt blue]] metal covering the interior sections. The tunnels facilitate colonization, since they can be adapted to human use at a fraction of what it would cost to dig them from scratch, and they and the other artifacts attract scientists who want to study them; then adventurers and prospectors who hope to make money by discovering more artifacts; and finally tourists rich enough to travel to Venus. By the next parts of the series, enough people have come to Venus to make it a sovereign state and a major power.\n\nIn the main part of the series, the frontier moves away from Venus after explorers discover an asteroid orbiting [[perpendicular]] to the [[ecliptic|ecliptic plane]], filled with cobalt blue tunnels, and hundreds of small Heechee spaceships. The asteroid, named ''Gateway'' by the discoverers, is occupied by the powerful nations of the world, who subsequently form the Gateway Corporation to administer the object.\n\nBy happenstance, one of the asteroid explorers enters a ship and hits a button, activating the vehicle and sending him on a thirty-day journey to another solar system. Upon his return, the Gateway Corporation decides to allow explorers (called Prospectors) to take trips on the mostly still-functioning ships. Even though the ships function, they have unknown pre-programmed destinations that cannot be changed, and humans cannot figure out the Heechee technology. Prospectors who find valuable materials or make discoveries are rewarded with substantial bonuses. Some Prospectors, though, become lost or arrive at worthless or dangerous locations. Ships on the asteroids come in three sizes and are defined as a \"one\", a \"three\", or a \"five\" based upon the number of passengers that they can carry (for the most part uncomfortably). Not every vehicle returns and there are other great hazards to the explorers.\n\n===''Gateway''===\nThe novel ''Gateway'' was serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' beginning November 1976, with illustrations by [[Vincent DiFate]], and was published as a book by [[St. Martin's Press]] in April 1977.<ref name=isfdb-gateway/> It won four major awards as the year's best English-language speculative fiction or science fiction novel.<ref name=isfdb-gateway/>{{efn|ISFDB lists the annual [[John W.

Broadhead hits the jackpot by becoming the first person to return from a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]]. In the sequel, Broadhead uses the money to fund further discoveries involving Heechee technology, locating a Heechee food factory that is capable of turning raw [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] ([[CHON]]) from comets into edible food for an overpopulated Earth.\n\nThe Heechee do not appear until book three in the series, in which the reason for their absence is explained. Some 500,000 years earlier, the Heechee were active in exploring the galaxy, including an [[Australopithecine]]-inhabited Earth (where a sampling of the creatures were extracted and left to propagate to modern time on a Heechee station). The Heechee found out that there was a race of pure energy called simply The Foe (or alternatively called either ''The Assassins'' or ''The Kugel'') wiping out civilizations on any planet where they emerged. The inherently cautious Heechee retreated to the interior of the black hole in the [[Galactic Core]] hoping to avoid being destroyed. Due to [[time dilation]], only a few hundred years have passed for the Heechee in the interior of the black hole since they left the normal universe. While in hiding, Heechee scout ships are periodically sent outside the black hole to check on developments through the universe in general and the emerging Earth in particular.\n\nWhen the latest Heechee crew exits the black hole, they are shocked to discover that humans are flying Heechee spaceships to all parts of the galaxy\u2014and one of those places happens to be the ''[[Kugelblitz (astrophysics)|Kugelblitz]]'' (a [[Black holes in fiction|black hole]] made of energy and not matter), where The Foe is concentrated. The Heechee expected humans to discover the ships, but the cautious race believed Earth people would study and unlock the ships' secrets over a period of hundreds of years\u2014and not simply take the equipment out for random rides in the dangerous galaxy.\n\nWhen the Heechee finally arrive in force, it is decided that the human intrusion cannot be reversed and The Foe must be confronted.\n\nThe Heechee have collected evidence that The Foe have been adding matter into the universe. The Foe intend to tilt the balance and allow the [[Big Bang]] to be reversed and the universe to collapse into a [[Big Crunch]] billions of years into the future. The Foe intend that once the universe rebounds into a second big bang, it will do so in the form of pure energy, removing the atomic matter that The Foe regard as so much clutter. A [[d\u00e9tente]] is created between Broadhead and The Foe, allowing the aliens to continue their project and humans and Heechee growing to accept that they too will eventually progress toward bodiless minds.\n\n==Physical and cultural attributes==\n\nThe Heechee's appearance is described as smaller than humans, bow-legged with skeletal frames, and possessed of dark, plastic-smooth skin with patches and curlicues of bright gold and scarlet. Each Heechee carries a [[microwave]] emitter in a storage pod between his or her legs. The pod is a [[trapezohedron]] shaped device and is also used for carrying equipment. The pods also explain why the seats on the ship have V-shaped indentations to accommodate the devices. The Heechee's home planet evolved near a naturally occurring microwave source, making the background radiation a necessary requirement for an ambient environment; the extended absence of the radiation will cause illness and death.\n\nHeechee relationships do not generally feature couple cohabitation for lengthy periods as with human marriages. A burrowing species, they tend to display more solitary conduct than humans. A Heechee bed is a cocoon, stuffed with soft bits of fabric. Heechees only breed when a female is in season.\n\nHeechee are omnivorous and use a fibrous plant to clean their teeth. There are two Heechee languages: the language of Do and the language of Feel, with communications with humans restricted to the former.\n\nUnlike humans, the Heechee did not develop [[artificial intelligence]]. Instead, they relied upon technology to pour the brains of departed Heechee into data storage, giving them a limited immortality. These \"stored minds\" operate at remarkably faster speeds than \"meat\" brains. Those stored operate in their own social strata often separate from their organic counterparts. After centuries of existence, the various Heechee consciousnesses join the \"massed minds\", essentially dying while memories are distributed among other machine stored intelligences.\n\n==Heechee devices==\n\nIn addition to the Food Factory, the Heechee created a number of devices that the Earth people discovered and used, including:\n* [[Piezoelectric]] devices (allowing voltage to be generated from placing pressure on crystals).\n* \"Prayer fans\" that appear and unfold like traditional [[Fan (implement)|fans]] but are actually computer-related equipment containing the minds of dead Heechees and, later, dead humans. The fans also are used for data storage.\n* [[Faster-than-light]] [[starship|spaceship]]s that act by nullifying the [[mass]] of the ship and avoiding the implication of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|Relativity Theory]] that states that an object becomes more massive as it approaches the speed of light.\n* A Disruptor of Order in Aligned Systems is the device that allows Heechee to unseal the [[Schwarzschild radius|Schwarzschild]] barrier in black holes and allow ships to traverse the boundaries (referred to jokingly by humans as a \"can opener\").\n* The \"Dream Couch\" or, more properly, a telepathic psychokinetic transceiver, is capable of receiving and transmitting thoughts across long distances. Heechees focus their law enforcement efforts on catching criminals while they are having perverse thoughts. In the novels, terrorists are depicted as putting insane people in Dream Couches and broadcast their thoughts into populated areas, causing widespread damage and destruction. Before learning of the Dream Couch being the cause, this was known on Earth as the \"130-day fever\", a period of planet-wide temporary insanity occurring roughly every one hundred and thirty days.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist |25em |notes=\n{{efn|name=isfdb-more |1=\nBeside subsequent editions<!--reprints?--> of ''The Gold at Starbow's End'' and a 21st-century collection of Pohl stories, the Internet Speculative Fiction Database shows that \"The Merchants of Venus\" also appeared in at least three English-language anthologies (1973, 1977, and 1994). \n<br>&nbsp;\nISFDB catalogs no interior illustrations for any but the original and ''The Gateway Trip''.

The 1972 magazine story was illustrated by [[Jack Gaughan]]<ref name=isfdb-if/> and the 1990 collection by [[Frank Kelly Freas]].<ref name=isfdb/>{{efn|name=isfdb-more}}\n\nThe Heechee originated <ref>Victoria B. Denton, ''Recent History of Sceince Fiction\", p. 46, 79</ref> as a plot device enabling Pohl to give a plausible reason for humans to make the effort of colonizing the inhospitable planet that space probes had proven [[Venus]] to be. In \"The Merchants of Venus\", the Heechee (a name given to them by humans since nobody knows what they called themselves) are nowhere to be found, and humans know of them only from their advanced artifacts.\n\nThe first evidence comes with the discovery of tunnels constructed under the Venusian surface, each tunnel distinguished by a mysterious light-emitting [[cobalt blue]] metal covering the interior sections. The tunnels facilitate colonization, since they can be adapted to human use at a fraction of what it would cost to dig them from scratch, and they and the other artifacts attract scientists who want to study them; then adventurers and prospectors who hope to make money by discovering more artifacts; and finally tourists rich enough to travel to Venus. By the next parts of the series, enough people have come to Venus to make it a sovereign state and a major power.\n\nIn the main part of the series, the frontier moves away from Venus after explorers discover an asteroid orbiting [[perpendicular]] to the [[ecliptic|ecliptic plane]], filled with cobalt blue tunnels, and hundreds of small Heechee spaceships. The asteroid, named ''Gateway'' by the discoverers, is occupied by the powerful nations of the world, who subsequently form the Gateway Corporation to administer the object.\n\nBy happenstance, one of the asteroid explorers enters a ship and hits a button, activating the vehicle and sending him on a thirty-day journey to another solar system. Upon his return, the Gateway Corporation decides to allow explorers (called Prospectors) to take trips on the mostly still-functioning ships. Even though the ships function, they have unknown pre-programmed destinations that cannot be changed, and humans canot figure out the Heechee technology. Prospectors who find valuable materials or make discoveries are rewarded with substantial bonuses. Some Prospectors, though, become lost or arrive at worthless or dangerous locations. Ships on the asteroids come in three sizes and are defined as a \"one\", a \"three\", or a \"five\" based upon the number of passengers that they can carry (for the most part uncomfortably). Not every vehicle returns and there are other great hazards to the explorers.\n\n===''Gateway''===\nThe novel ''Gateway'' was serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' beginning November 1976, with illustrations by [[Vincent DiFate]], and was published as a book by [[St. Martin's Press]] in April 1977.<ref name=isfdb-gateway/> It won four major awards as the year's best English-language speculative fiction or science fiction novel.<ref name=isfdb-gateway/>{{efn|ISFDB lists the annual [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]], Hugo Award, and  Nebula Award\u2014sometimes called the \"triple crown\", selected by a respected panel, by world fans, and by American writers respectively. It also lists the annual Locus Award for Best Novel, 8th place in the 1987 all-time poll of Locus readers (All-Time Best SF Novel), and 11th place in the comparable 1998 poll (All-Time Best SF Novel before 1990).}} Translations into French, German, Dutch, and Italian were all published during 1978 and 1979.<ref name=isfdb-gateway/>{{efn|ISFDB catalogs editions published in six foreign languages: French and German, 1978; Dutch and Italian, 1979; Portuguese, 1986; Hungarian, 1991.}}\n\n''Gateway'' focuses on the exploits of one of those explorers, Robinette Broadhead. Broadhead hits the jackpot by becoming the first person to return from a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]]. In the sequel, Broadhead uses the money to fund further discoveries involving Heechee technology, locating a Heechee food factory that is capable of turning raw [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] ([[CHON]]) from comets into edible food for an overpopulated Earth.\n\nThe Heechee do not appear until book three in the series, in which the reason for their absence is explained. Some 500,000 years earlier, the Heechee were active in exploring the galaxy, including an [[Australopithecine]]-inhabited Earth (where a sampling of the creatures were extracted and left to propagate to modern time on a Heechee station). The Heechee found out that there was a race of pure energy called simply The Foe (or alternatively called either ''The Assassins'' or ''The Kugel'') wiping out civilizations on any planet where they emerged. The inherently cautious Heechee retreated to the interior of the black hole in the [[Galactic Core]] hoping to avoid being destroyed. Due to [[time dilation]], only a few hundred years have passed for the Heechee in the interior of the black hole since they left the normal universe. While in hiding, Heechee scout ships are periodically sent outside the black hole to check on developments through the universe in general and the emerging Earth in particular.\n\nWhen the latest Heechee crew exits the black hole, they are shocked to discover that humans are flying Heechee spaceships to all parts of the galaxy\u2014and one of those places happens to be the ''[[Kugelblitz (astrophysics)|Kugelblitz]]'' (a [[Black holes in fiction|black hole]] made of energy and not matter), where The Foe is concentrated. The Heechee expected humans to discover the ships, but the cautious race believed Earth people would study and unlock the ships' secrets over a period of hundreds of years\u2014and not simply take the equipment out for random rides in the dangerous galaxy.\n\nWhen the Heechee finally arrive in force, it is decided that the human intrusion cannot be reversed and The Foe must be confronted.\n\nThe Heechee have collected evidence that The Foe have been adding matter into the universe. The Foe intend to tilt the balance and allow the [[Big Bang]] to be reversed and the universe to collapse into a [[Big Crunch]] billions of years into the future. The Foe intend that once the universe rebounds into a second big bang, it will do so in the form of pure energy, removing the atomic matter that The Foe regard as so much clutter. A [[d\u00e9tente]] is created between Broadhead and The Foe, allowing the aliens to continue their project and humans and Heechee growing to accept that they too will eventually progress toward bodiless minds.\n\n==Physical and cultural attributes==\n\nThe Heechee's appearance is described as smaller than humans, bow-legged with skeletal frames, and possessed of dark, plastic-smooth skin with patches and curlicues of bright gold and scarlet. Each Heechee carries a [[microwave]] emitter in a storage pod between his or her legs. The pod is a [[trapezohedron]] shaped device and is also used for carrying equipment. The pods also explain why the seats on the ship have V-shaped indentations to accommodate the devices. The Heechee's home planet evolved near a naturally occurring microwave source, making the background radiation a necessary requirement for an ambient environment; the extended absence of the radiation will cause illness and death.\n\nHeechee relationships do not generally feature couple cohabitation for lengthy periods as with human marriages. A burrowing species, they tend to display more solitary conduct than humans. A Heechee bed is a cocoon, stuffed with soft bits of fabric. Heechees only breed when a female is in season.\n\nHeechee are omnivorous and use a fibrous plant to clean their teeth. There are two Heechee languages: the language of Do and the language of Feel, with communications with humans restricted to the former.\n\nUnlike humans, the Heechee did not develop [[artificial intelligence]]. Instead, they relied upon technology to pour the brains of departed Heechee into data storage, giving them a limited immortality. These \"stored minds\" operate at remarkably faster speeds than \"meat\" brains. Those stored operate in their own social strata often separate from their organic counterparts. After centuries of existence, the various Heechee consciousnesses join the \"massed minds\", essentially dying while memories are distributed among other machine stored intelligences.\n\n==Heechee devices==\n\nIn addition to the Food Factory, the Heechee created a number of devices that the Earth people discovered and used, including:\n* [[Piezoelectric]] devices (allowing voltage to be generated from placing pressure on crystals).\n* \"Prayer fans\" that appear and unfold like traditional [[Fan (implement)|fans]] but are actually computer-related equipment containing the minds of dead Heechees and, later, dead humans. The fans also are used for data storage.\n* [[Faster-than-light]] [[starship|spaceship]]s that act by nullifying the [[mass]] of the ship and avoiding the implication of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|Relativity Theory]] that states that an object becomes more massive as it approaches the speed of light.\n* A Disruptor of Order in Aligned Systems is the device that allows Heechee to unseal the [[Schwarzschild radius|Schwarzschild]] barrier in black holes and allow ships to traverse the boundaries (referred to jokingly by humans as a \"can opener\").\n* The \"Dream Couch\" or, more properly, a telepathic psychokinetic transceiver, is capable of receiving and transmitting thoughts across long distances. Heechees focus their law enforcement efforts on catching criminals while they are having perverse thoughts. In the novels, terrorists are depicted as putting insane people in Dream Couches and broadcast their thoughts into populated areas, causing widespread damage and destruction. Before learning of the Dream Couch being the cause, this was known on Earth as the \"130-day fever\", a period of planet-wide temporary insanity occurring roughly every one hundred and thirty days.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist |25em |notes=\n{{efn|name=isfdb-more |1=\nBeside subsequent editions<!--reprints?--> of ''The Gold at Starbow's End'' and a 21st-century collection of Pohl stories, the Internet Speculative Fiction Database shows that \"The Merchants of Venus\" also appeared in at least three English-language anthologies (1973, 1977, and 1994). \n<br>&nbsp;\nISFDB catalogs no interior illustrations for any but the original and ''The Gateway Trip''.

In 1960, its name was changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Auburn University}}\n[[File:1883 Old Main Building South College Street Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|\"Old Main\", the first building on Auburn's campus, was destroyed by fire in 1887]]\n\nThe Alabama Legislature chartered the institution as the East Alabama Male College on February 1, 1856, coming under the guidance of the [[Methodist Church]] in 1859.<ref>Anson West, ''History of Methodism in Alabama'' (Nashville: Methodist Episcopal Church South, 1893), 738\u2013739.</ref> Its first president was Reverend [[William J. Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.\n\nAuburn's early history is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Southern United States#Reconstruction and Jim Crow|South]]. Classes were held in \"Old Main\" until the college was closed due to the war, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A.

The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs.

Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K.

Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the \"space race\" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Fall Freshman Statistics'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602042446/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224549/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224840/https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2015<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2015/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n!2014<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2014/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2013/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2012<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2012/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2011<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2011/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2010<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2010/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2009<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2009/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2008<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2008/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.<ref>Auburn University Campus Map \u2013 http://oitapps.auburn.edu/campusmap/ click on each building for more information.<br />* Buildings at auburn University {{cite web|url=http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |title=Explore the history of Auburn University's Campus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174847/http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin:auto;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Ethnic composition of student body \u2013 Fall 2016'<ref>{{cite web |title=Race/Ethnicitiy Enrollment by College/School FALL 2016 |url=https://web.auburn.edu/ir/factbook/enrollment/psbe/eebcs3.aspx |publisher=Auburn University |date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010. It is a five-story building accommodating 300 students.\n* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC's presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 21 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 5 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011,2013, 2016, 2018), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8\u20130, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] to the [[Florida State Seminoles]] 34\u201331 in [[Pasadena, California]]. <!-- Keep this a summary.

Auburn's highest finish in the NCAA tournament was a tie for 2nd in 2002.<ref name=\"Golfweek\">{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/w-golf/spec-rel/101005aaa.html |title=Auburn Women's Golf named No. 3 Program since 1999 |publisher= Auburn University |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSince 1996, the team has been headed by Coach Kim Evans, a 1981 alumna, who has turned the program into one of the most competitive in the nation. Coach Evans has helped develop All-Americans, SEC Players of the Year as well as three SEC Freshman of the Year. She has led the Tigers to eight-straight NCAA appearances. She is by far the winningest Coach in Auburn Golf History, having over 1100 wins and winning six of Auburn's seven total SEC Titles. Evans was named National Coach of the Year in 2003 and has coached 8 individual All-Americans while at Auburn.\n\n===Track and field===\nThe Auburn women's track and field team won its first ever national title in 2006 at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, scoring 57 points to win over the University of Southern California, which finished second with 38.5 points. Auburn posted All-American performances in nine events, including two individual national champions and three second-place finishers, and broke two school records during the four-day event.\n\nAuburn's men's team finished second at the 2003 NCAA Outdoor Championships and at the 1978, 1997 and 2003 NCAA Indoor Championships. The women's team finished 14th (2002, 2003) at the Outdoor Championships and seventh (2003) at the Indoor Championships.\n\n===Equestrian===\nAuburn's Equestrian team captured the 2006 national championship, the first equestrian national championship in school history. Senior Kelly Gottfried and junior Whitney Kimble posted team-high scores in their respective divisions as the Auburn equestrian team clinched the overall national championship at the 2006 Varsity Equestrian Championships at the EXPO/New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Albuquerque, NM.  In 2008, the Auburn Equestrian team captured the 2008 Hunt Seat National Championship. Over fences riders finished 12\u20131\u20131 overall for the week. Auburn has also consistently been highly ranked in the Women's Intercollegiate Equestrian National Coaches Poll as well. The Auburn Equestrian team most recently captured the 2016 national championship.\n\n==Traditions==\n{{Main|Auburn University traditions}}\nAuburn University has many traditions including a creed, an alma mater, a fight song, a battle cry, a mascot and several notable game-day traditions including an eagle flying over the football field.\n\n===Colors===\nThe official colors are:<ref name=\"AU Official Colors\">{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/template/colors.html|title=Auburn University Official Colors |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ocm.auburn.edu\"/>\n* Burnt Orange {{color box|#DD550C}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (221,85,12) (#DD550C), [[Pantone|PMS]] (158) \n* Navy Blue {{color box|#03244D}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (3,36,77) (#03244D), [[Pantone|PMS]] (289)\n\n===Fight song===\nAuburn University's [[fight song]], \"War Eagle\", was written in 1954 and 1955 by [[Robert Allen (song composer)|Robert Allen]] and [[Al Stillman]]. It was introduced at the beginning of the [[1955 Auburn Tigers football team|1955 football season]] and served as the official fight song ever since.\n\n===Hey Day===\nIn the 1950s and 60s Auburn designated a day on campus called \"Hey Day\" that encouraged students to interact with each other and simply say \"hey.\" Auburn reinstated this tradition in 1985 and has continued to evolve until this day. On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say \"hey\" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers \u2013 Traditions|publisher=AuburnTigers.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503170727/http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|archive-date=May 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn's Eagles===\nAuburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by USA Today as the \"Best Sports Tradition\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner |title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=May 29, 2015}}<br />* {{cite web|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/03/rolling-of-toomers-corner-oaks-voted-best-sports-tradition|title=Rolling of Toomer's Corner Oaks voted 'Best Sports Tradition'|author=The Plainsman|work=The Plainsman |access-date=March 9, 2018}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-sports-tradition/|title=10 Best Sports Traditions|author=USA Today|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2010, Harvey Updike Jr. poisoned the beloved trees at Toomer's Corner using 80DF after Auburn beat rival and Updike's team of choice 28\u201327.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/harvey_updyke_poisoned_toomers.html|title=Harvey Updyke poisoned Toomer's Corner oaks 5 years ago|work=AL.com|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Selected organizations==\n===Media and publications===\n* ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' \u2013 the university's student-run newspaper, has won 23 [[National Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] since 1966.

The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A.

The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L.

This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th).

Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K.

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.<ref>Auburn University Campus Map \u2013 http://oitapps.auburn.edu/campusmap/ click on each building for more information.<br />* Buildings at auburn University {{cite web|url=http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |title=Explore the history of Auburn University's Campus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174847/http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin:auto;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Ethnic composition of student body \u2013 Fall 2016'<ref>{{cite web |title=Race/Ethnicitiy Enrollment by College/School FALL 2016 |url=https://web.auburn.edu/ir/factbook/enrollment/psbe/eebcs3.aspx |publisher=Auburn University |date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010. It is a five-story building accommodating 300 students.\n* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC's presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 21 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 5 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011,2013, 2016, 2018), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8\u20130, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] to the [[Florida State Seminoles]] 34\u201331 in [[Pasadena, California]]. <!-- Keep this a summary.

In addition to [[Bo Jackson]], Auburn has supplied several other players to [[Major League Baseball]], including [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], [[Gregg Olson]], [[Scott Sullivan (baseball)|Scott Sullivan]], [[Tim Hudson]], [[Mark Bellhorn]], [[Jack Baker (baseball)|Jack Baker]], [[Terry Leach]], [[Josh Hancock]], [[Gabe Gross]], [[Steven Register]], [[Trey Wingenter]], [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] and [[Josh Donaldson]].\n\n===Women's golf===\nAuburn's Women's Golf team has risen to be extremely competitive in the NCAA in recent years. Since 1999, they hold an 854\u2013167\u201313 (.826 win percentage) record. The team has been in five NCAA finals and finished second in 2002 and then third in 2005. The program has a total of seven SEC Championships (1989, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2009). The seven titles is third all time for Women's golf.<ref name=\"SECGOLF\">{{cite web |url= http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/w-golf/recaps/041909aaa.html |title= No. 6 Women's Golf Rallies In Final Round To Win SEC Championship|publisher= Auburn University | accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref> In October 2005, Auburn was named the #3 team nationally out of 229 total teams since 1999 by ''GolfWeek'' magazine.

Coach Evans has helped develop All-Americans, SEC Players of the Year as well as three SEC Freshman of the Year. She has led the Tigers to eight-straight NCAA appearances. She is by far the winningest Coach in Auburn Golf History, having over 1100 wins and winning six of Auburn's seven total SEC Titles. Evans was named National Coach of the Year in 2003 and has coached 8 individual All-Americans while at Auburn.\n\n===Track and field===\nThe Auburn women's track and field team won its first ever national title in 2006 at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, scoring 57 points to win over the University of Southern California, which finished second with 38.5 points. Auburn posted All-American performances in nine events, including two individual national champions and three second-place finishers, and broke two school records during the four-day event.\n\nAuburn's men's team finished second at the 2003 NCAA Outdoor Championships and at the 1978, 1997 and 2003 NCAA Indoor Championships. The women's team finished 14th (2002, 2003) at the Outdoor Championships and seventh (2003) at the Indoor Championships.\n\n===Equestrian===\nAuburn's Equestrian team captured the 2006 national championship, the first equestrian national championship in school history. Senior Kelly Gottfried and junior Whitney Kimble posted team-high scores in their respective divisions as the Auburn equestrian team clinched the overall national championship at the 2006 Varsity Equestrian Championships at the EXPO/New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Albuquerque, NM.  In 2008, the Auburn Equestrian team captured the 2008 Hunt Seat National Championship. Over fences riders finished 12\u20131\u20131 overall for the week. Auburn has also consistently been highly ranked in the Women's Intercollegiate Equestrian National Coaches Poll as well. The Auburn Equestrian team most recently captured the 2016 national championship.\n\n==Traditions==\n{{Main|Auburn University traditions}}\nAuburn University has many traditions including a creed, an alma mater, a fight song, a battle cry, a mascot and several notable game-day traditions including an eagle flying over the football field.\n\n===Colors===\nThe official colors are: <ref name=\"AU Official Colors\">{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/template/colors.html|title=Auburn University Official Colors |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ocm.auburn.edu\"/>\n* Burnt Orange {{color box|#DD550C}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (221,85,12) (#DD550C), [[Pantone|PMS]] (158) \n* Navy Blue {{color box|#03244D}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (3,36,77) (#03244D), [[Pantone|PMS]] (289)\n\n===Fight song===\nAuburn University's [[fight song]], \"War Eagle\", was written in 1954 and 1955 by [[Robert Allen (song composer)|Robert Allen]] and [[Al Stillman]]. It was introduced at the beginning of the [[1955 Auburn Tigers football team|1955 football season]] and served as the official fight song ever since.\n\n===Hey Day===\nIn the 1950s and 60s Auburn designated a day on campus called \"Hey Day\" that encouraged students to interact with each other and simply say \"hey.\" Auburn reinstated this tradition in 1985 and has continued to evolve until this day. On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say \"hey\" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers \u2013 Traditions|publisher=AuburnTigers.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503170727/http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|archive-date=May 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn's Eagles===\nAuburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by USA Today as the \"Best Sports Tradition\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner |title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=May 29, 2015}}<br />* {{cite web|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/03/rolling-of-toomers-corner-oaks-voted-best-sports-tradition|title=Rolling of Toomer's Corner Oaks voted 'Best Sports Tradition'|author=The Plainsman|work=The Plainsman |access-date=March 9, 2018}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-sports-tradition/|title=10 Best Sports Traditions|author=USA Today|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2010, Harvey Updike Jr. poisoned the beloved trees at Toomer's Corner using 80DF after Auburn beat rival and Updike's team of choice 28\u201327.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/harvey_updyke_poisoned_toomers.html|title=Harvey Updyke poisoned Toomer's Corner oaks 5 years ago|work=AL.com|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Selected organizations==\n===Media and publications===\n* ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' \u2013 the university's student-run newspaper, has won 23 [[National Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] since 1966.

It is the home of the LSO's community and music education programme, LSO Discovery. The main body of the church seats up to 372 and is used by the LSO for rehearsals, and by a wide variety of musicians for performances and recording.

It was built to relieve the City church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Cripplegate]],<ref>[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/localtim.htm Timeline of London] accessed 25 Apr 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415082139/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/localtim.htm |date=15 April 2007 }}</ref> under the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]], an attempt to meet the religious needs of London's burgeoning 18th century population. The [[ancient parish]] of St Giles lay partly within the City and partly outside its boundaries in [[Middlesex]]: these two parts were now to be separated, with the Middlesex portion becoming a new [[St Luke's, London|parish of St Luke's]]. Construction began in 1727 and was completed in 1733, when the church was consecrated and the parish detached from St Giles.\n\nThe architects were the joint salaried surveyors to the Commission, [[John James (architect)|John James]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. James is thought to have been responsible for the body of the church, and Hawksmoor for the [[obelisk]] spire (a most unusual feature for an Anglican church), the west tower and the flanking staircase wings.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1195700 |desc=Former Church of St Luke |grade=I |access-date=29 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"downes\">Downes 1960.</ref> The spire was topped by an unusual [[weather vane]] depicting the head of a [[dragon]] with a fiery [[comet]]-like tail: this was misinterpreted locally as a [[louse]], and by the mid-20th century had gained the church the nickname \"lousy St Luke's\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Londoner's Diary \u2013 Title was wrong |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=5 March 1951 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\nThe church stood in the historically marshy [[Moorfields]] area, and from an early date suffered from problems of [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]].<ref name=\"downes\"/> The effects of the subsidence remain visible in the distorted shapes of the windows on the north side of the building.\n\n==Burials==\n[[File:Caslon_family_grave,_St_Luke's.jpg|thumb|right|The Caslon family grave]]\nBurials in the small churchyard included:\n*[[Mark Catesby]] (1683\u20131749), naturalist.

The font and organ case from St Luke's church were moved to St Giles' church. In 1964 St Luke's was closed by the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of London]] after subsidence made it unsafe. The roof was removed two years later for safety reasons, and the empty shell became a dramatic ruin for nearly 40 years, overgrown with trees, despite being a Grade I [[listed building]].\n\nAfter several controversial proposals to redevelop offices inside the retained walls, it was converted by the St Luke Centre Management Company Ltd for the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] as a [[concert hall]], rehearsal and recording space, and educational resource. The conversion was designed by Axel Burrough at London architects [[Levitt Bernstein]], who installed a heavy concrete slab roof which keeps out traffic noise from the nearby road.

It served as a parish church from 1733 to 1964, but since 2003 has been a music centre operated by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and known as '''LSO St Luke's'''. It is the home of the LSO's community and music education programme, LSO Discovery. The main body of the church seats up to 372 and is used by the LSO for rehearsals, and by a wide variety of musicians for performances and recording. Additional rooms in the crypt provide practice facilities for professional musicians, students and community groups.\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Luke subsidence.JPG|thumb|left|The north side of St Luke's, showing the distortion of the windows caused by the subsidence which prompted the church's closure]]\n[[File:St Luke Old Street vane.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The weather vane]]\nThe church is sited on [[Old Street]], north of the [[City of London]]. It was built to relieve the City church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Cripplegate]],<ref>[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/localtim.htm Timeline of London] accessed 25 Apr 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415082139/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/localtim.htm |date=15 April 2007 }}</ref> under the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]], an attempt to meet the religious needs of London's burgeoning 18th century population. The [[ancient parish]] of St Giles lay partly within the City and partly outside its boundaries in [[Middlesex]]: these two parts were now to be separated, with the Middlesex portion becoming a new [[St Luke's, London|parish of St Luke's]]. Construction began in 1727 and was completed in 1733, when the church was consecrated and the parish detached from St Giles.\n\nThe architects were the joint salaried surveyors to the Commission, [[John James (architect)|John James]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. James is thought to have been responsible for the body of the church, and Hawksmoor for the [[obelisk]] spire (a most unusual feature for an Anglican church), the west tower and the flanking staircase wings.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1195700 |desc=Former Church of St Luke |grade=I |access-date=29 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"downes\">Downes 1960.</ref> The spire was topped by an unusual [[weather vane]] depicting the head of a [[dragon]] with a fiery [[comet]]-like tail: this was misinterpreted locally as a [[louse]], and by the mid-20th century had gained the church the nickname \"lousy St Luke's\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Londoner's Diary \u2013 Title was wrong |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=5 March 1951 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\nThe church stood in the historically marshy [[Moorfields]] area, and from an early date suffered from problems of [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]].<ref name=\"downes\"/> The effects of the subsidence remain visible in the distorted shapes of the windows on the north side of the building.\n\n==Burials==\n[[File:Caslon_family_grave,_St_Luke's.jpg|thumb|right|The Caslon family grave]]\nBurials in the small churchyard included:\n*[[Mark Catesby]] (1683\u20131749), naturalist.

His grave is lost.\n\nIn preparation for the conversion of the church into a music centre, the crypt was cleared of burials in the year 2000. A total of 1053 burials were archaeologically recorded, removed, and reburied at [[Brookwood Cemetery]], Surrey.<ref>Boyle, Boston & Witkin 2005.</ref> A television documentary, \"Changing Tombs\" (2001), recorded the process.<ref>{{cite web |title=Changing Tombs (2001) |publisher=British Film Institute |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b87476e9d |accessdate=29 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Deconsecration and reuse==\nIn 1959, in response to a declining inner-city population, the parish of St Luke's was re-absorbed into that of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]]. The font and organ case from St Luke's church were moved to St Giles' church. In 1964 St Luke's was closed by the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of London]] after subsidence made it unsafe. The roof was removed two years later for safety reasons, and the empty shell became a dramatic ruin for 40 years, overgrown with trees, despite being a Grade I [[listed building]].\n\nAfter several controversial proposals to redevelop offices inside the retained walls, it was converted by the St Luke Centre Management Company Ltd for the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] as a [[concert hall]], rehearsal and recording space, and educational resource. The conversion was designed by Axel Burrough at London architects [[Levitt Bernstein]], who installed a heavy concrete slab roof which keeps out traffic noise from the nearby road. Though this is similar in profile to the former eighteenth-century roof, its great weight is supported on tall steel columns inside the hall described by the designer as \"tree-like\". The interior acoustic can be varied for different events, from full orchestra to soloists, by the use of absorbent surfaces that unroll like blinds across the ceiling and down the walls, whilst the seating and staging are also highly flexible.

As president, Mainairdi gave the club stability and strong leadership and paved the way for Columbus' future successes. After joining the [[Pacific Coast Soccer League (1908-73)|Pacific Coast League]] in 1959-60, they became one of the league's most popular and successful teams of the 1960s. After winning their first national title in 1964, they won back-to-back Pacific Coast League playoff titles in 1965 and 1966 and then finally their first Pacific Coast League championship in 1968-69. In that 1968-69 season, they won the league, the playoffs, BC Soccer's Province Cup, and Canada Soccer's [[Challenge Trophy]].\n\nTheir domination on the field captured the imagination of the Italian soccer community in particular. The team played at Callister Park in Vancouver at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsoccerweb.com/articles-features/pcsl.htm |title=BC Soccer Web |publisher=BC Soccer Web |accessdate=April 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002107/http://www.bcsoccerweb.com/articles-features/pcsl.htm |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn all, Columbus FC played 12 seasons in the Pacific Coast League from 1959-60 to 1970-71, winning three championships (1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71) and four playoff titles (1965, 1966, 1969, 1970).

Therefore for a few years the same players played under the Vancouver Italia name until coming back with the Columbus name in 1975.\n\nFollowing the death of Mainairdi, the club came under the guidance of Paul Anthony who had joined the team as a player in 1954.\n\nAnthony continued on as secretary and team manager and played a key role in the evolution of the club until his death in 1982.  From 1982 to 1987, the administration of the club was under the leadership of Eugenio Vazzoler, Peter Greco and General manager Charlie Cuzzetto.\n\nIn 1985, Columbus entered the newly formed semi-professional Pacific Rim Soccer League with Joe Tinucci as president and Mike Bernardis as coach. Columbus as a semi-professional club, quickly became cup champions<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Meers marker clinches title for Rangers |date=September 11, 1985|newspaper=Richmond Review |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/329460996/?terms=Pacific%2BRim%2Bsoccer|page=15|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Columbus win title |date=September 30, 1985|newspaper=Nanaimo Daily News |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/325581035/?terms=Vancouver%2BColumbus|page=8|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref> as well as national finalists with [[Toronto Blizzard (1986\u20131993)|Toronto Blizzard]].\n\nAfter an absence of 10 years Columbus re-emerged in 2003 under the direction of Rob Mascitti, Carmen D'Onofrio and Joe Papa.  Although the passing of years has seen the influx of non -Italian players, the major part of the team still hold fast to its Italian roots, a tribute to past Coaches Gianni Azzi, Jack Hobbs 1964 (Canadian Champions) Joe Csabai 1969 (Canadian Champions), Tony Canta 1977, 1978 (Canadian Champions).\n\nColumbus has been at the forefront of Canadian soccer and has planted deep soccer roots in Canada over the past 60 years. The team has provided more players than any other amateur club in Canada to Canada's Professional, Provincial, Olympic and National Team rosters as well as supplying Universities and Colleges. Columbus also holds the distinction of having the most players in the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame with eleven players. After the Westminster Royals, Columbus is the most successful amateur club in Canada having appeared in six National Finals and winning four. Columbus also holds the record for the largest margin of victory in a Canadian championship final game a 10\u20130 score against Montreal Ukraine in 1969.\n\nThe Columbus family of teams include the men's open, women's open, over 35s, over 45s (Premier and Division 1), over 50s and over 55s. As of 2015, Columbus family of teams are now associated with the Italian Canadian Sports Federation, which also include boys and girls teams from five-year olds to adult.\n\nOff the field the Columbus Alumni also play a major role in Canadian soccer as evidenced by the following:\n\n* [[Victor Montagliani]]:\n**President of CONCACAF\n**Vice-president FIFA\n** President of Canadian Soccer Association\n**  Past vice-president Canadian Soccer Association\n**  Past president British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Charlie Cuzzetto\n** Member of FIFA Disciplinary Committee\n** Director of Canadian Soccer Association\n**Member of CONCACAF Appeals Committee \n** Past president British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Joe Cuzzetto\n** Former technical director \u2013 Italian Canadian SportsFederation (ICSF)\n** Former director of British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Frank Ciaccia\n**Residency recruitment officer&nbsp;\u2013 Vancouver Whitecaps\n** Former technical director\u2014Mountain FC\n* Danny Lenarduzzi\n** Director of youth soccer development \u2014 Vancouver Whitecaps\n*Sam Lenarduzzi\n**Manager of regional community programs&nbsp;\u2013 Vancouver Whitecaps\n*Frank Iuele\n**Technical director \u2013 Italian Canadian Sports Federation (ICSF)\n**Technical director - Burnaby Metro Program\n* Michael Findlay\n** Former BC Soccer head of soccer development\n** Former Canada Soccer Men's National Team Head Coach\n\nIn addition to winning numerous league championships, Kennedy Cups, Imperial Cups and Provincial Cups, Columbus has won the Challenge Trophy four times: 1964, 1969, 1977 and 1978 and were finalists in 1968 and 2007.\n\nIn addition, Columbus Masters Over 35s also won a National Championship in 2003 and Western Championship in 2009 and 2013. The Over 40s have won two league and one cup  championships.

[[association football|soccer]] club based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] currently playing in the Premier division of the [[Vancouver Metro Soccer League]]. In 2013, the club was recognized as a [[Canada Soccer Hall of Fame]] Organization of Distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canadasoccer.com/honoured-members-p160784#Organisations|title=Honoured Members - Canada Soccer|website=www.canadasoccer.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nFather Della Torre was instrumental in  starting the team in 1953 as '''Sacred Heart''' soccer team, with the goal of providing a team for the many [[Italian Canadian|Italian]] immigrants who settled in the east side of Vancouver.\n\nBy 1957, the team name changed to Columbus and was under the guidance of Peter Mainardi. As president, Mainairdi gave the club stability and strong leadership and paved the way for Columbus' future successes. After joining the [[Pacific Coast Soccer League (1908-73)|Pacific Coast League]] in 1959-60, they became one of the league's most popular and successful teams of the 1960s. After winning their first national title in 1964, they won back-to-back Pacific Coast League playoff titles in 1965 and 1966 and then finally their first Pacific Coast League championship in 1968-69. In that 1968-69 season, they won the league, the playoffs, BC Soccer's Province Cup, and Canada Soccer's [[Challenge Trophy]].\n\nTheir domination on the field captured the imagination of the Italian soccer community in particular. The team played at Callister Park in Vancouver at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsoccerweb.com/articles-features/pcsl.htm |title=BC Soccer Web |publisher=BC Soccer Web |accessdate=April 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002107/http://www.bcsoccerweb.com/articles-features/pcsl.htm |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn all, Columbus FC played 12 seasons in the Pacific Coast League from 1959-60 to 1970-71, winning three championships (1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71) and four playoff titles (1965, 1966, 1969, 1970). In 1972, they joined the newly-formed British Columbia Premier League and won both the league and playoff title.<ref name=\"Title for Columbus\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QpdlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DYsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=756%2C4357231|title=Title for Columbus|publisher=Google|author1=Vancouver Sun|date=November 13, 1972|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, for having played in an unsanctioned tournament, the club and its owner Peter Mainardi were suspended.  Therefore for a few years the same players played under the Vancouver Italia name until coming back with the Columbus name in 1975.\n\nFollowing the death of Mainairdi, the club came under the guidance of Paul Anthony who had joined the team as a player in 1954.\n\nAnthony continued on as secretary and team manager and played a key role in the evolution of the club until his death in 1982.  From 1982 to 1987, the administration of the club was under the leadership of Eugenio Vazzoler, Peter Greco and General manager Charlie Cuzzetto.\n\nIn 1985, Columbus entered the newly formed semi-professional Pacific Rim Soccer League with Joe Tinucci as president and Mike Bernardis as coach. Columbus as a semi-professional club, quickly became cup champions<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Meers marker clinches title for Rangers |date=September 11, 1985|newspaper=Richmond Review |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/329460996/?terms=Pacific%2BRim%2Bsoccer|page=15|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Columbus win title |date=September 30, 1985|newspaper=Nanaimo Daily News |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/325581035/?terms=Vancouver%2BColumbus|page=8|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref> as well as national finalists with [[Toronto Blizzard (1986\u20131993)|Toronto Blizzard]].\n\nAfter an absence of 10 years Columbus re-emerged in 2003 under the direction of Rob Mascitti, Carmen D'Onofrio and Joe Papa.  Although the passing of years has seen the influx of non -Italian players, the major part of the team still hold fast to its Italian roots, a tribute to past Coaches Gianni Azzi, Jack Hobbs 1964 (Canadian Champions) Joe Csabai 1969 (Canadian Champions), Tony Canta 1977, 1978 (Canadian Champions).\n\nColumbus has been at the forefront of Canadian soccer and has planted deep soccer roots in Canada over the past 60 years. The team has provided more players than any other amateur club in Canada to Canada's Professional, Provincial, Olympic and National Team rosters as well as supplying Universities and Colleges. Columbus also holds the distinction of having the most players in the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame with eleven players. After the Westminster Royals, Columbus is the most successful amateur club in Canada having appeared in six National Finals and winning four. Columbus also holds the record for the largest margin of victory in a Canadian championship final game a 10\u20130 score against Montreal Ukraine in 1969.\n\nThe Columbus family of teams include the men's open, women's open, over 35s, over 45s (Premier and Division 1), over 50s and over 55s. As of 2015, Columbus family of teams are now associated with the Italian Canadian Sports Federation, which also include boys and girls teams from five-year olds to adult.\n\nOff the field the Columbus Alumni also play a major role in Canadian soccer as evidenced by the following:\n\n* [[Victor Montagliani]]:\n**President of CONCACAF\n**Vice-president FIFA\n** President of Canadian Soccer Association\n**  Past vice-president Canadian Soccer Association\n**  Past president British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Charlie Cuzzetto\n** Member of FIFA Disciplinary Committee\n** Director of Canadian Soccer Association\n**Member of CONCACAF Appeals Committee \n** Past president British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Joe Cuzzetto\n** Former technical director \u2013 Italian Canadian SportsFederation (ICSF)\n** Former director of British Columbia Soccer Association\n* Frank Ciaccia\n**Residency recruitment officer&nbsp;\u2013 Vancouver Whitecaps\n** Former technical director\u2014Mountain FC\n* Danny Lenarduzzi\n** Director of youth soccer development \u2014 Vancouver Whitecaps\n*Sam Lenarduzzi\n**Manager of regional community programs&nbsp;\u2013 Vancouver Whitecaps\n*Frank Iuele\n**Technical director \u2013 Italian Canadian Sports Federation (ICSF)\n**Technical director - Burnaby Metro Program\n* Michael Findlay\n** Former BC Soccer head of soccer development\n** Former Canada Soccer Men's National Team Head Coach\n\nIn addition to winning numerous league championships, Kennedy Cups, Imperial Cups and Provincial Cups, Columbus has won the Challenge Trophy four times: 1964, 1969, 1977 and 1978 and were finalists in 1968 and 2007.\n\nIn addition, Columbus Masters Over 35s also won a National Championship in 2003 and Western Championship in 2009 and 2013. The Over 40s have won two league and one cup  championships.
