Popular sources for consumer reviews are e-commerce sites like [[Amazon.com]], [[Zappos]] or lately in the Yoga field for schools such as Banjaara Yoga and Ayurveda, and social media sites like [[TripAdvisor]] and [[Yelp]]. [[E-commerce]] sites often have consumer reviews for products and sellers separately. Usually, consumer reviews are in the form of several lines of texts accompanied by a numerical rating. This text is meant to aid in shopping decision of a prospective buyer. A consumer review of a product usually comments on how well the product measures up to expectations based on the specifications provided by the manufacturer or seller. It talks about performance, reliability, quality defects, if any, and value for money. Consumer review, also called 'word of mouth' and 'user generated content' differs from 'marketer generated content' in its evaluation from consumer or user point of view. Often it includes comparative evaluations against competing products. Observations are factual as well as subjective in nature. Consumer review of sellers usually comment on service experienced, and dependability or trustworthiness of the seller. Usually, it comments on factors such as timeliness of delivery, packaging, and correctness of delivered items, shipping charges, return services against promises made, and so on.\n\nConsumer reviews online have become a major factor in business [[reputation]] and brand image due to the popularity of TripAdvisor, Yelp, and online review websites. A negative review can damage the reputation of a business and this has created a new industry of [[reputation management]] where companies attempt to remove or hide bad reviews so that more favourable content is found when potential customers do research.\n\nAn ''expert review'' usually refers to a review written by someone who has tested several peer products or services to identify which offers the best value for money or the best set of features. An example of this is Amazon Vine. [[Amazon Vine]] is a program which was introduced to \"help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/vine/help|title=Amazon.co.uk - Amazon Vine Programme|website=www.amazon.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> This program is invite-only and is designed to generate reviews for product vendors that Amazon works with.\n\nOne type of user review can be in the physical world, such as a video reviewing a product or software. This is common on platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo.\n\nA ''bought review'' is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review their new product.\n\n==Book review==\nA [[book review]] (or book report) is a form of criticism in which a book is analyzed based on content, style, and merit. It is often carried out in periodicals, as school work, or online. Its length may vary from a single paragraph to a substantial [essay]. In the case of a work of poetry or fiction, or of nonfiction in which the literary merits of the work are an important element, a review will commonly use the methods of [[literary criticism]]. Such a review often contains evaluations of the book on the basis of personal taste. Reviewers, in literary periodicals, often use the occasion of a book review for a display of learning or to promulgate their own ideas on the topic of a fiction or [[non-fiction]] work. At the other end of the spectrum, some book reviews resemble simple plot summaries. Reviews of non-fiction works intended for instructional or informational purposes may focus more directly on concerns such as practical usefulness and reader-friendliness.\n\n==Music reviews==\n\n===Performance reviews===\nReviews of live music performances are typically short articles that tell readers about the performers or group(s) that were involved and the pieces or songs that were performed. The comments made by reviewers fall, roughly into two categories: technical comments and subjective/artistic comments. The elements in the \"technical\" category include rhythmic \"togetherness\", intonation, errors or slip-ups, and so on. These elements are fairly \"black and white\"; a pianist playing a concerto either played the right notes on a climactic scale run, or she missed it. The subjective comments refer to elements which are a matter of taste. The balance between the different elements in a review (information about the performer or group; information about the pieces/songs; commentary about the technical and subjective elements of the performance) depends on the audience that a music critic is writing for. Music reviewers writing in local newspapers or general-interest magazines may not be able to assume that the readers will be familiar with music performers and pieces/songs, so they may decide to include a great deal of \"background\" information.\n\n===Recording reviews===\nMusic critics and music writers also review recordings of music, including individual songs or pieces or entire albums. In the case of a review of an entire album, the reviewer will not only judge the individual songs or pieces; they will also judge how well all of the songs or pieces work together or go together.\n\nThe age of digital downloads may considerably change the album review.  Where previously albums were purchased as collections of songs, often with a common theme, the rise of individual song downloads may have significant impact on consumers' exposure to an artist's music.  Die-hard fans will most likely continue to explore an artist's complete work, but individuals will most likely make significantly different choices and \"cherry-pick\" songs they have been exposed to.  The concept of \"singles\" or individual hits marked for retail has been around for long time; however, the price for a single in the days of CDs or 45's was much closer to the complete album price.  When you consider that each song on an artist's album is often priced at the same amount, the odds of the average consumer purchase the entire album instead of selecting the \"hit\" songs decreases significantly.\n\n===Composition reviews===\nIn Classical music, music critics may also do reviews of compositions, even if the piece or song has never been performed and it only exists on manuscript paper in a score. To review a composition in this fashion, the critic will use music theory skills such as harmonic analysis and thematic analysis, along with their knowledge of idioms and compositional practices.etc.\n\n==Motion picture, television and video reviews==\nA [[Film criticism|motion picture review]] is a work of film criticism addressing the merits of one or more motion pictures. Generally, the term \"movie review\" implies a work of [[Film criticism|journalistic film criticism]] rather than of academic criticism. Such reviews have appeared in newspapers and printed periodicals since the beginning of the film industry, and now are published in general-interest websites as well as specialized film and film review sites. Television programs and other videos are now commonly reviewed in similar venues and by similar methods.\n\n==Bought review==\nA ''bought review'' is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review his new product. Primarily used in the car, movie, and game industry this system creates a kind of undercover advertising. Bought reviews tend to be biased due to the informative value of reviews. In some cases, a bought review may be independent, if the person that is hired to do the review has a strong reputation for independence and integrity. Even if a \"bought review\" from a respected critic is actually independent, the perception of potential bias will remain, due to the financial relationship between the company and the critic.\n\nA similar type of review that may be biased is the so-called \"[[puff piece]]\", a review of \"[a product]\", film, or event that is written by a sympathetic reviewer or by an individual who has a connection to the product or event in question, either in terms of an employment relationship or other links. For example, a major media conglomerate that owns both print media and record companies may instruct one of its employees in one of its newspapers to do a review of an album which is being released by the conglomerate's record company. Although some journalists may assert their professional independence and integrity, and insist on producing an unbiased review, in other cases, writers may succumb to the pressure and pen a biased \"puff piece\" which praises the product or event while omitting any discussion of any shortcomings. In some cases, \"puff pieces\" purport to provide a review of the product or event, but instead merely provide \"[[peacock words]]\" (\"An amazing recording\"); \"[[weasel words]]\"  and tabloid-style filler which is peripheral or irrelevant to assessing the qualities of the product or event (\"During the filming, there were rumors that romantic sparks flew between the two co-leads, who were often seen talking together on the set\").\n\nSeveral online review manipulation strategies have also been reported, such as writing fake reviews and offering monetary compensation to remove negative reviews.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=G\u00f6ssling|first1=Stefan|last2=Hall|first2=C.

[[:nl:Peking Express (Nederland & Vlaanderen)|The series]] has already gone through five seasons. In the [[Netherlands]] it is screened by [[Net 5]] and in Belgium by [[VT4]].\n\n[[:de:Peking Express|A German version]] was shown in 2005. The concept has also been sold to Scandinavia where it was broadcast for the first time in the autumn of 2007. The Scandinavian version is shown on [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in Sweden, [[TVNorge]] in Norway and [[Kanal 5 (Denmark)|Kanal 5]] in Denmark. A French version named ''[[:fr:P\u00e9kin Express|P\u00e9kin Express]]'' is screened by [[M\u00e9tropole 6|M6]], with twelve seasons aired so far from 2006 to 2019, and a thirteen and fourteen planned for 2020. It can be seen on [[TV5Monde|TV5]] outside France. In Spain, the first four seasons of local version ''[[:es:Pek\u00edn Express|Pek\u00edn Express]]'' aired on [[Cuatro (channel)|Cuatro]] from 2008 to 2011; [[Atresmedia]] acquired the rights in 2015 and has produced two seasons since.<ref>[http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/43199/antena3-arrebata-cuatro-reality-pekin-express/ Antena 3 arrebata a Cuatro el reality 'Pek\u00edn express']</ref> An Italian version has been produced since 2012 by RAI and shown on [[Rai 2]] successfully. In Poland, the series has been broadcast on [[TVN (Polish TV channel)|TVN]] since 2016 and was known for its first two seasons, which were set in Asia, as [[Azja Express]]. From season 3 onwards, it has been known as [[Ameryka Express]], with its production location changing to [[Americas|America]]; a fourth season premiered in spring 2020. In Romania, the series has aired successfully on [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]] since 2018 as [[:ro:Asia Express|Asia Express]], with two seasons so far and a third currently airing.\n\n==General theme==\nThe theme of the show is to demonstrate how various couples deal with the challenges and pitfalls of attempting a long-distance hitchhike to a strange city, together with all the difficulties presented by trying to communicate in a language they don't understand. Tension was added by including couples who had broken up \"in real life\", but were willing to work together for the sake of winning the race.\n\nIn somewhat similar fashion to ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', couples that come in last at various checkpoints along the way are eliminated from further competition. In the second series, each of the couples was given \u20ac1 per person/per day as their stipend along the route.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe music used during the opening sequence is \"Summon the Worms\" from [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]]'s soundtrack to the 2003 [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]''.\n\n==Winning couples in the international

of Dutch television channels|Dutch]]\u2013[[Flanders|Flemish]] [[reality series|reality]] game show that follows a series of couples as they [[hitchhike]] to or from Beijing (only in the first three seasons; seasons four and five are set in South America). [[:nl:Peking Express (Nederland & Vlaanderen)|The series]] has already gone through five seasons. In the [[Netherlands]] it is screened by [[Net 5]] and in Belgium by [[VT4]].\n\n[[:de:Peking Express|A German version]] was shown in 2005. The concept has also been sold to Scandinavia where it was broadcast for the first time in the autumn of 2007. The Scandinavian version is shown on [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in Sweden, [[TVNorge]] in Norway and [[Kanal 5 (Denmark)|Kanal 5]] in Denmark. A French version named ''[[:fr:P\u00e9kin Express|P\u00e9kin Express]]'' is screened by [[M\u00e9tropole 6|M6]], with twelve seasons aired so far from 2006 to 2019, and a thirteen and fourteen planned for 2020. It can be seen on [[TV5Monde|TV5]] outside France. In Spain, the first four seasons of local version ''[[:es:Pek\u00edn Express|Pek\u00edn Express]]'' aired on [[Cuatro (channel)|Cuatro]] from 2008 to 2011; [[Atresmedia]] acquired the rights in 2015 and has produced two seasons since.<ref>[http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/43199/antena3-arrebata-cuatro-reality-pekin-express/ Antena 3 arrebata a Cuatro el reality 'Pek\u00edn express']</ref> An Italian version has been produced since 2012 by RAI and shown on [[Rai 2]] successfully. In Poland, the series has been broadcast on [[TVN (Polish TV channel)|TVN]] since 2016 and was known for its first two seasons, which were set in Asia, as [[Azja Express]]. From season 3 onwards, it has been known as [[Ameryka Express]], with its production location changing to [[Americas|America]]; a fourth season premiered in spring 2020. In Romania, the series has aired successfully on [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]] since 2018 as [[:ro:Asia Express|Asia Express]], with two seasons so far and a third currently airing.\n\n==General theme==\nThe theme of the show is to demonstrate how various couples deal with the challenges and pitfalls of attempting a long-distance hitchhike to a strange city, together with all the difficulties presented by trying to communicate in a language they don't understand. Tension was added by including couples who had broken up \"in real life\", but were willing to work together for the sake of winning the race.\n\nIn somewhat similar fashion to ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', couples that come in last at various checkpoints along the way are eliminated from further competition. In the second series, each of the couples was given \u20ac1 per person/per day as their stipend along the route.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe music used during the opening sequence is \"Summon the Worms\" from [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]]'s soundtrack to the 2003 [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]''.\n\n==Winning couples in the international

It was manufactured by the Japanese [[optics]] company Nippon Kogaku K. K. ([[Nikon Corporation]] since 1988) in Japan from September 1971 to 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217025948/http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |archive-date=17 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It used a horizontal-travel [[focal plane shutter]] with titanium shutter curtains and a speed range of 1 to 1/2000 second (up to 10 seconds using the self-timer) plus Bulb and Time, and flash X-sync of 1/80 second. It had dimensions (with DE-1 head, see below) of 98&nbsp;mm height, 152.5&nbsp;mm width, 65&nbsp;mm depth and 730 g weight. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.\n\nThe F2 is the second member of the long line of Nikon F-series professional-level 35&nbsp;mm SLRs that began with the [[Nikon F]] (manufactured 1959\u20131974) and followed each other in a sort of dynastic succession as the top-of-the-line Nikon camera. The other members were the [[Nikon F3|F3]] (1980\u20132001), [[Nikon F4|F4]] (1988\u20131996), [[Nikon F5|F5]] (1996\u20132005) and [[Nikon F6|F6]] (2004\u2013present). The F-series do not share any major components except for the all-important bayonet lens mount ('F mount').\n\nAll Nikon professional F-series SLRs are full [[system camera]]s. This means that each camera body serves as only a modular hub.\n<gallery>\nFile:Nikon F2 body front.jpg|F2S\nFile:Nikon F2 body back open.jpg|F2S, open film door\nFile:F2-titan-11.jpg|F2 \u2013 bayonet F-mount\nFile:Nikon F2 SB SLR camera with GN Auto Nikkor 2,8 f=45mm lens.JPG|Nikon F2SB with DP-3 prism and GN Auto Nikkor 1:2,8 f=45mm lens\nFile:F2-titan-5.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\nFile:F2-titan-7.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\n</gallery>\n\n==Features==\nThe Nikon F2 is an all-metal, mechanically-controlled (springs, gears, levers), manual focus SLR with manual exposure control. The camera itself needed no batteries, though the prism [[light meter]] did (and of course the motor drive if added). The F2 replaced the Nikon F, adding many new features (a faster 1/2000-second maximum shutter speed, a swing open back for easier film loading, a wider assortment of detachable finders and metering heads, a 250 exposure film back, a larger reflex mirror to ensure no vignetting, and a shutter release nearer the front of the camera for better ergonomics). It also offered a detachable motor drive, something the F only had as a custom modification. It was the last all-mechanical professional-level Nikon SLR.\n\n==Lenses==\nThe F2 accepts all lenses with the [[Nikon F-mount|Nikon F bayonet mount]] (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera), with certain limitations or exceptions depending on the F2 version. The later F2A and F2AS Photomic variants (see below) require lenses supporting the Automatic maximum aperture Indexing (AI) feature (introduced in 1977). The manual focus Nippon Kogaku made AI lenses were the Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. The original Nikkor \"non-AI\" (introduced before 1977) lenses, will mount but require stop down metering. Nippon Kogaku had a service to retrofit non-AI lenses with a new aperture ring with the AI feature to produce \"AI'd\" lenses, but this service ended decades ago.\n\nThe older F2, F2S and F2SB Photomic variants (see below) require lenses with a \"meter coupling shoe\" (or prong, informally called \"rabbit ears\" by photography enthusiasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cameragx.com/2009/09/17/a-history-of-slr-cameras-in-50-years-of-bayonet-evolution-part-ii-of-vi/|title=50 years of lens mount evolution (Part II of VI)|date=17 September 2009}}</ref> These lenses are the Nikkor non-AI, AI'd Nikkor, Nikkor AI and Nikkor AI-S types. Lenses without rabbit ears, such as the Nikon Series E, AF Nikkor, AF Nikkor D, AF-I Nikkor and AF-S Nikkor types, will mount but require stop down metering.\n\nThe F2 with plain/eye-level DE-1 prism (no light meter; see below) will work with either lens types. Note that the Nikkor AI-S and Nikkor AI types are AI types plus have rabbit ears and will function properly on all Nikon F2 variants.\n\nNikon's most recent 35mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (2000) lacking an aperture control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's DX digital SLRs, will mount but will not function properly. A few exotic fisheye lenses from the 1960s require mirror lock-up and therefore an auxiliary viewfinder is preferred. IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's [[Advanced Photo System]] (APS) film SLRs, must not be mounted on any F2, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage even with the mirror locked up.\n\nIn 1977 Nippon Kogaku made about 55 non-AI and AI lenses, ranging from a '''Fisheye-Nikkor 6&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' 220\u00b0 circular fisheye to a '''Reflex-Nikkor 2000&nbsp;mm f/11''' super-long mirror telephoto. This was the largest lens selection in the world by far.\n\nThe standard lens for most professionals was the '''Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4''', but some preferred the '''Nikkor 35&nbsp;mm f/2''' with a wider field of view for grab shots. The '''Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/2.5''' was renowned for its superb sharpness and [[bokeh]] and was a favorite for head-and-shoulders portraits (\"head shots\").\n\nSpecial purpose lenses included the '''Micro-Nikkors 55&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' and '''55&nbsp;mm f/2.8''', '''Micro-Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/4''' for close-up \"macro\" photography, the '''Noct-Nikkor 58&nbsp;mm f/1.2''' for low light photography, the '''PC-Nikkor 28&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' shifting perspective control lens, the '''GN-Nikkor 45&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' for automatically setting the proper aperture for flash exposure based on distance (also useful as a very small/light \"pancake\" lens), the '''[[Nikkor 13mm f/5.6]]''' widest angle (118\u00b0) rectilinear lens for SLRs ever made, the '''Nikkor 300&nbsp;mm f/2.8 ED IF''' fast telephoto useful for sports and wildlife photography, the versatile, but heavy '''Zoom-Nikkor 50\u2013300&nbsp;mm f/4.5 ED''' and the quick framing, but notoriously middling optical-quality '''Zoom-Nikkor 43\u201386&nbsp;mm f/3.5'''.\n\nThere were innumerable independent manufacturer lenses available in the Nikon F mount. The most famous was probably the [[Vivitar]] Series 1 70\u2013210&nbsp;mm f/3.5 Macro Zoom (released 1974), the first independent zoom lens to meet most professional photographers' quality standards.\n\n==Viewfinders==\nHowever, it was the F2's interchangeable viewfinders (also known as \"heads\")<ref>[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f2/index.htm Nikon Article on F2's Debut], Nikon</ref> that marked it as a truly professional-level SLR and was its greatest strength. By providing updated heads every few years, Nippon Kogaku was able to introduce new versions of the F2 and keep the basic body in the latest technology until production ended in 1980. Note that F2 heads were often sold separately from the body, mostly in black finish with about 10% in chrome, and it is therefore not unusual to see body/head combinations with mismatched serial numbers and/or colors.\n\nThe head on the basic Nikon F2 was called the '''Nikon DE-1'''. It provided a virtually 100% accurate viewing image, but was a plain pentaprism eyelevel viewing head with no built-in light meter and so had no metering or exposure information display, except for a flash-ready light. Unlike the other heads, about 90% of DE-1s were chrome finished. It was unpopular because of the lack of a built-in meter, but remained available for the life of the F2. F2 bodies with DE-1 finders maintain the highest prices on the secondary market.\n\nIf a pentaprism head with a built-in light meter was mounted on the F2, the camera became an F2 Photomic. However, since Nippon Kokagu made five different metering heads over the life of the F2, there were five different F2 Photomic versions. The use of any Photomic head requires that batteries (two S76 or A76, or SR44 or LR44) be installed in the F2 body to power the head's electronics.\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 and DP-2.jpg|thumb|Nikon DP-1 and DP-2 viewfinders]]\nThe original '''Nikon F2 Photomic''', packaged with the '''Nikon DP-1''' head, was manufactured from 1971 to 1977. The DP-1 had a center-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between horizontally arranged +/\u2013 over/underexposure markers at the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the photographer's actual camera selections. Flanking the needle array on the left and right were a readout of the camera set f-stop and shutter speed, respectively. The needle array was duplicated on the top of the DP-1 head to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. A Nikon F2 Photomic with Nikkor-S 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $660 in 1972. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price.\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|Needle lightmeter on DP-1]]\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-2 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|LED lightmeter on DP-2]]\n[[Image:F2s.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nikon F2s using the DP-2 viewfinder]]\nManufactured from 1973 to 1977, the '''F2S Photomic''' used the '''DP-2''' head. Although it looked very different, the DP-2 was functionally very similar to the DP-1. It substituted an all-solid-state light-both-LEDs exposure control system using two arrow-shaped [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) over/underexposure indicators for better visibility in low light situations and better overall reliability. This was important, because the DP-2's CdS meter had better low-light sensitivity than the DP-1\u2014down to Exposure Value (EV) \u22122, instead of EV 1, at ASA 100. A chrome Nikon F2S Photomic with Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $961 in 1976. Note: SLRs were usually discounted 30 to 40 percent from list.\n\nWith the '''DP-3''' head, the camera became the '''F2SB Photomic''', available 1976 to 1977. The DP-3 introduced three innovations: a silicon photodiode light meter (a first for Nikon SLRs) for faster and more accurate light readings, a five-stage center-the-LED exposure control system using +/o/\u2212 LEDs, and an eyepiece blind.\n\nThese three early Photomic heads required Nikon F-mount lenses with a meter coupling shoe (\"rabbit ears\", see above). Rabbit ear lenses required a special mounting procedure. After mounting, the lens aperture ring must be turned back and forth to the smallest aperture (largest f-stop number) and then to the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number) to ensure that the lens and the head couple properly (Nippon Kogaku called it indexing the maximum aperture of the lens\u2014users called it the Nikon Shuffle!) and meter correctly. This system seems unwieldy to today's photographers, but it was second nature to Nikon and [[Nikkormat]] camera using photographers of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Image:Nikon-F2AS.jpg|thumb|A black body F2AS (incl DP-12 prism, as seen here) was very popular among photojournalists in the 1970s.]]\n[[Image:F2AScloseup.jpg|thumb|250|An F2AS (incl DP-12 prism). The EV metering range is a remarkable -2 to 17 with 100 ASA film.]]\nThe '''F2A Photomic''' came with the '''DP-11''' head; the '''F2AS Photomic''' used the '''DP-12''' head. The DP-11 and DP-12 (both introduced in 1977) functioned exactly the same as the DP-1 and DP-3, respectively, except that these heads supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977, see above). Nikkor AI lenses had a \"meter coupling ridge\" cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on a spring-loaded \"meter coupling lever\" on the Photomic head to transfer aperture setting information. AI lenses allowed carefree lens mounting and ended the double twisting that used to allow observers to spot a Nikon/Nikkormat user from a hundred paces. The F2AS Photomic (DP-12 head) was the most advanced F2 version and the chrome version with Nikkor AI 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $1,278 in 1978. (SLR selling prices were typically 30 to 40 percent below list.) This, the last version of the Nikon F2 Photomic, has become the most desired and collected F2 today.\n\nThe F2S Photomic (DP-2 head) and F2SB Photomic (DP-3 head) also accepted the unusual '''Nikon DS-1''' or '''DS-2 EE Aperture Control Units'''. The F2AS (DP-12) required the equivalent '''DS-12'''. These were early attempts by Nippon Kogaku to provide shutter priority autoexposure by having an electric servomotor automatically turn the lens aperture ring in response to the set shutter speed and light meter reading. The DS-1, -2 and -12 were bulky, slow and unreliable, and were feeble and inelegant attempts to add autoexposure to the manual exposure F2.\n\nThere were also three special purpose meterless heads available for the F2: the '''Nikon DW-1''' waist-level finder (a non-pentaprism head; look down directly at the mirror-reversed image on the focusing screen), the '''DA-1''' action finder (providing 60&nbsp;mm of eye relief; extremely large exit pupil that can be viewed while wearing face masks, safety goggles, etc.) and the '''DW-2''' 6X magnifying finder (waist-level finder with magnifier; good for precise focusing).\n\n==Focusing screens==\nThe F2 also had interchangeable viewfinder focusing screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard '''Type K''' screen had central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder and 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12&nbsp;mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.\n\nThe optional screens were:\n*'''Type A''' \u2013 central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Standard equipment with early F2s. Changeover to Type K occurred circa 1976.\n*'''Type B''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm focusing spot plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Useful for close ups and long telephotos.\n*'''Type C''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm clear spot with crosshair reticle. Very bright and useful for photo-microscopy, astrophotography, and parallax focusing method.\n*'''Type D''' \u2013 plain matte screen. Best screen for use with long telephotos with small apertures.\n*'''Type E''' \u2013 Type B with a grid of 5 horizontal and 3 vertical lines. Called \"architectural screen\" and excellent for \"Rule of Thirds\" pictorialist compositions. The most popular replacement screen.\n*'''Type G''' \u2013 central 12&nbsp;mm extra-bright microprism without matte background (cannot assess depth of field). Four versions (G1\u2013G4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type H''' \u2013 fullscreen extra-bright microprism; also cannot assess depth of field. Four versions (H1\u2013H4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Intended for sports photography, but not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type J''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm microprism plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle.\n*'''Type L''' \u2013 Type A, but with rangefinder set at a 45\u00b0 angle from lower left to upper right. Permits focusing on horizontal or vertical subjects.\n*'''Type M''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm double cross hairs with marked horizontal and vertical scales. Excellent for photo-microscopy.\n*'''Type P''' \u2013 Type L, but adds 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar and fullscreen crosshair. Originally marketed as the \"Apollo P screen,\" it was a screen favored by NASA on the bodies they acquired for their use.\n*'''Type R''' \u2013 Type E, but adds a 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder to the center of the screen.\n*'''Type S''' \u2013 for F2 Data (see below) only. Type A with etched marking for data imprint area.\n*'''Type T''' \u2013 for F2 Type A with etched markings for taking pictures of TV screens.\nThe combination and wide selection of heads and screens allowed photographers to customize their F2s to their heart's content.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive.jpg|thumb|Nikon MD-2 motor drive back without camera]]\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive front.jpg|thumb|MD-2 motor drive front with camera]]\nMajor accessories for the F2 included the '''Nikon MD-1''' (introduced in 1971) and '''MD-2''' (1973) [[motor drive]]s, providing automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a '''Nikon MB-1''' battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two '''Nikon MS-1''' battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate required that the F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two '''Nikon MN-1''' nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum advance rate is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.\n\nThe F2 also accepted the lighter, cheaper and less capable '''Nikon MD-3''' motor drive. The MD-3 did not have power rewind and had an advance rate of 2.5 frame/s with the standard '''MB-2''' battery pack holding 8 AA or LR6 batteries. Optionally, it could reach 3.5 frame/s with an MB-1 battery pack with 10 AA or LR6 batteries; 4 frame/s with MB-1 and MN-1 nicad battery.\n\nThe F2 could also mount the '''Nikon MF-1''' (33/10 feet/meters film = 250 frames; required two '''Nikon MZ-1''' film cassettes) and '''MF-2''' (100/30 feet/meters film = 750 frames; required two '''MZ-2''' film cassettes) bulk film backs. These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted and needed to take more than seven seconds' worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.\n\nStarting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku introduced the '''Nikon Speedlight SB-2''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-5''' (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-6''' (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and '''SB-7E''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) [[electronic flash]]es. Note that the F2 did not use a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can be connected to the Nikon shoe via the '''Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler'''.\n\nThe '''Nikon ML-1 Modulite''' was a wireless infrared remote controller with a 200/60 feet/meters line-of-sight range. It was a two part device: a handheld transmitter plus a camera mounted receiver. Note that the receiver needed to be connected to a motor drive. The '''Nikon MW-1''' was a similar device, but was larger and more powerful and used radio signals for a longer 2300/700 feet/meters obstructed view range. The MW-1 could also control three separate F2s by broadcasting three different codes.\n\nThe '''Nikon MT-1''' intervalometer allowed completely untended time lapse photography. It could fire the F2 for a specific number of frames at a particular shutter speed at set time intervals.\n\nNippon Kogaku also made scores of minor accessories for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction lenses, supplementary close-up lenses, lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced in excess of US$110,000\u2014the most extensive and expensive in the world.\n\n==Special F2 Versions==\nThere were several special purpose versions of the F2 manufactured in small numbers. Although they were all working cameras, today they are all rare collector's items.\n\n[[File:F2 titan noname.jpg|thumb|150px|F2 T]]\nThe '''F2T''' was a special ultra-rugged version of the F2 (DE-1 head) with [[titanium]] bayonet mount, top and bottom plates, and camera back, plus a special '''DE-1T''' titanium covered meterless prism head, sold in parallel with the regular F2s from 1978 to 1980. Most F2Ts were given a special textured black finish but a very few came in natural titanium finish, including the first F2Ts and the very last F2s ever manufactured. Their serial numbers began with '92', e.g., \"F2 9201544.'\n\nThe '''F2 Titan''' was a black only late variant of the F2T, distinguished by the word \"Titan\" engraved in Roman script on the front of the camera below the shutter release. They carry the number 79 in front of the serial number.\n\nThe H in the '''F2H''' of 1978 denoted \"High Speed\". It was yet another titanium-armored F2 but this time with a fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored '''Nikon MD-100''' high-speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The depth-of-field preview button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was a modified version of the MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film advance rate. The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other. The bodies (7-digit serial number) and motordrives (6-digit serial number) do not have matching serial numbers, contrary to often repeated misinformation. Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.\n\nAs the name implies, the '''F2 Data''' had a primitive data back. It used a tiny internal flash unit to imprint the time, date or sequential number on the film. This data back recorded the time by imprinting a tiny picture of a slightly less tiny [[Seiko]] made analogue clock onto the film. It also had a special insert plate that the photographer could write on and have this note imprinted on the film. There were two versions of the F2 Data: one with the '''MF-10''' camera back for standard 35&nbsp;mm film cartridges and one with the '''MF-11''' 250 frame bulk film back. The F2 Data also came packaged with an MD-2 motor drive and your choice of DE-1, DP-11 or DP-12 head plus a special Type S focusing screen that marked the left-side data imprint area. F2 Data bodies carry the numbers '77' in front of the serial number. Approximately 5,000 units were produced.\n\nFinally there was the '''F2A Anniversary''' model. This was marketed as a collector's item of 4,000 specially numbered bodies intended to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Nikon cameras in the USA. A plate was glued to the front of the camera below the shutter release noting, \"25th Anniversary\" (which has fallen off many bodies) and came in a special silver-colored box. The F2A Anniversary was not authorized by Nippon Kogaku; it was the creation of the American importer, Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries (EPOI).\n\n==Current status==\nBecause of the F2's durability, because there were so many manufactured (816,000 units) and because film SLRs have been largely replaced with digital equivalents in many markets, the F2 is still relatively common today and is available on the used market for low prices\u2014US$200\u2013400<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2.html Nikon F2 completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref> depending on the head. However, these may be well worn examples used by professional photographers and are generally in mediocre condition.\n\nThe Nikon F2 is also collectable. If a pristine F2 body and head with date-compatible serial numbers is found, it will carry collector's items price tags. The black body version of the F2AS model, in near new condition, can exceed $1,100 at auction.<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2AS.html Nikon F2 AS completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*\"Nikon MF/AF Bodies \u2013 Lens Compatibility\" http://www.nikonlinks.com/unklbil/bodylens.htm retrieved 3 January 2006\n* Anonymous. \"Modern Photography's Annual Guide to 47 Top Cameras: Nikon F2 Photomic\" p 117.

It was manufactured by the Japanese [[optics]] company Nippon Kogaku K. K. ([[Nikon Corporation]] since 1988) in Japan from September 1971 to 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217025948/http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |archive-date=17 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It used a horizontal-travel [[focal plane shutter]] with titanium shutter curtains and a speed range of 1 to 1/2000 second (up to 10 seconds using the self-timer) plus Bulb and Time, and flash X-sync of 1/80 second. It had dimensions (with DE-1 head, see below) of 98&nbsp;mm height, 152.5&nbsp;mm width, 65&nbsp;mm depth and 730 g weight. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.\n\nThe F2 is the second member of the long line of Nikon F-series professional-level 35&nbsp;mm SLRs that began with the [[Nikon F]] (manufactured 1959\u20131974) and followed each other in a sort of dynastic succession as the top-of-the-line Nikon camera. The other members were the [[Nikon F3|F3]] (1980\u20132001), [[Nikon F4|F4]] (1988\u20131996), [[Nikon F5|F5]] (1996\u20132005) and [[Nikon F6|F6]] (2004\u2013present). The F-series do not share any major components except for the all-important bayonet lens mount ('F mount').\n\nAll Nikon professional F-series SLRs are full [[system camera]]s. This means that each camera body serves as only a modular hub.\n<gallery>\nFile:Nikon F2 body front.jpg|F2S\nFile:Nikon F2 body back open.jpg|F2S, open film door\nFile:F2-titan-11.jpg|F2 \u2013 bayonet F-mount\nFile:Nikon F2 SB SLR camera with GN Auto Nikkor 2,8 f=45mm lens.JPG|Nikon F2SB with DP-3 prism and GN Auto Nikkor 1:2,8 f=45mm lens\nFile:F2-titan-5.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\nFile:F2-titan-7.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\n</gallery>\n\n==Features==\nThe Nikon F2 is an all-metal, mechanically-controlled (springs, gears, levers), manual focus SLR with manual exposure control. The camera itself needed no batteries, though the prism [[light meter]] did (and of course the motor drive if added). The F2 replaced the Nikon F, adding many new features (a faster 1/2000-second maximum shutter speed, a swing open back for easier film loading, a wider assortment of detachable finders and metering heads, a 250 exposure film back, a larger reflex mirror to ensure no vignetting, and a shutter release nearer the front of the camera for better ergonomics). It also offered a detachable motor drive, something the F only had as a custom modification. It was the last all-mechanical professional-level Nikon SLR.\n\n==Lenses==\nThe F2 accepts all lenses with the [[Nikon F-mount|Nikon F bayonet mount]] (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera), with certain limitations or exceptions depending on the F2 version. The later F2A and F2AS Photomic variants (see below) require lenses supporting the Automatic maximum aperture Indexing (AI) feature (introduced in 1977). The manual focus Nippon Kogaku made AI lenses were the Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. The original Nikkor \"non-AI\" (introduced before 1977) lenses, will mount but require stop down metering. Nippon Kogaku had a service to retrofit non-AI lenses with a new aperture ring with the AI feature to produce \"AI'd\" lenses, but this service ended decades ago.\n\nThe older F2, F2S and F2SB Photomic variants (see below) require lenses with a \"meter coupling shoe\" (or prong, informally called \"rabbit ears\" by photography enthusiasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cameragx.com/2009/09/17/a-history-of-slr-cameras-in-50-years-of-bayonet-evolution-part-ii-of-vi/|title=50 years of lens mount evolution (Part II of VI)|date=17 September 2009}}</ref> These lenses are the Nikkor non-AI, AI'd Nikkor, Nikkor AI and Nikkor AI-S types. Lenses without rabbit ears, such as the Nikon Series E, AF Nikkor, AF Nikkor D, AF-I Nikkor and AF-S Nikkor types, will mount but require stop down metering.\n\nThe F2 with plain/eye-level DE-1 prism (no light meter; see below) will work with either lens types. Note that the Nikkor AI-S and Nikkor AI types are AI types plus have rabbit ears and will function properly on all Nikon F2 variants.\n\nNikon's most recent 35mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (2000) lacking an aperture control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's DX digital SLRs, will mount but will not function properly. A few exotic fisheye lenses from the 1960s require mirror lock-up and therefore an auxiliary viewfinder is preferred. IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's [[Advanced Photo System]] (APS) film SLRs, must not be mounted on any F2, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage even with the mirror locked up.\n\nIn 1977 Nippon Kogaku made about 55 non-AI and AI lenses, ranging from a '''Fisheye-Nikkor 6&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' 220\u00b0 circular fisheye to a '''Reflex-Nikkor 2000&nbsp;mm f/11''' super-long mirror telephoto. This was the largest lens selection in the world by far.\n\nThe standard lens for most professionals was the '''Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4''', but some preferred the '''Nikkor 35&nbsp;mm f/2''' with a wider field of view for grab shots. The '''Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/2.5''' was renowned for its superb sharpness and [[bokeh]] and was a favorite for head-and-shoulders portraits (\"head shots\").\n\nSpecial purpose lenses included the '''Micro-Nikkors 55&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' and '''55&nbsp;mm f/2.8''', '''Micro-Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/4''' for close-up \"macro\" photography, the '''Noct-Nikkor 58&nbsp;mm f/1.2''' for low light photography, the '''PC-Nikkor 28&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' shifting perspective control lens, the '''GN-Nikkor 45&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' for automatically setting the proper aperture for flash exposure based on distance (also useful as a very small/light \"pancake\" lens), the '''[[Nikkor 13mm f/5.6]]''' widest angle (118\u00b0) rectilinear lens for SLRs ever made, the '''Nikkor 300&nbsp;mm f/2.8 ED IF''' fast telephoto useful for sports and wildlife photography, the versatile, but heavy '''Zoom-Nikkor 50\u2013300&nbsp;mm f/4.5 ED''' and the quick framing, but notoriously middling optical-quality '''Zoom-Nikkor 43\u201386&nbsp;mm f/3.5'''.\n\nThere were innumerable independent manufacturer lenses available in the Nikon F mount. The most famous was probably the [[Vivitar]] Series 1 70\u2013210&nbsp;mm f/3.5 Macro Zoom (released 1974), the first independent zoom lens to meet most professional photographers' quality standards.\n\n==Viewfinders==\nHowever, it was the F2's interchangeable viewfinders (also known as \"heads\")<ref>[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f2/index.htm Nikon Article on F2's Debut], Nikon</ref> that marked it as a truly professional-level SLR and was its greatest strength. By providing updated heads every few years, Nippon Kogaku was able to introduce new versions of the F2 and keep the basic body in the latest technology until production ended in 1980. Note that F2 heads were often sold separately from the body, mostly in black finish with about 10% in chrome, and it is therefore not unusual to see body/head combinations with mismatched serial numbers and/or colors.\n\nThe head on the basic Nikon F2 was called the '''Nikon DE-1'''. It provided a virtually 100% accurate viewing image, but was a plain pentaprism eyelevel viewing head with no built-in light meter and so had no metering or exposure information display, except for a flash-ready light. Unlike the other heads, about 90% of DE-1s were chrome finished. It was unpopular because of the lack of a built-in meter, but remained available for the life of the F2. F2 bodies with DE-1 finders maintain the highest prices on the secondary market.\n\nIf a pentaprism head with a built-in light meter was mounted on the F2, the camera became an F2 Photomic. However, since Nippon Kokagu made five different metering heads over the life of the F2, there were five different F2 Photomic versions. The use of any Photomic head requires that batteries (two S76 or A76, or SR44 or LR44) be installed in the F2 body to power the head's electronics.\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 and DP-2.jpg|thumb|Nikon DP-1 and DP-2 viewfinders]]\nThe original '''Nikon F2 Photomic''', packaged with the '''Nikon DP-1''' head, was manufactured from 1971 to 1977. The DP-1 had a center-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between horizontally arranged +/\u2013 over/underexposure markers at the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the photographer's actual camera selections. Flanking the needle array on the left and right were a readout of the camera set f-stop and shutter speed, respectively. The needle array was duplicated on the top of the DP-1 head to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. A Nikon F2 Photomic with Nikkor-S 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $660 in 1972. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price.\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|Needle lightmeter on DP-1]]\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-2 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|LED lightmeter on DP-2]]\n[[Image:F2s.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nikon F2s using the DP-2 viewfinder]]\nManufactured from 1973 to 1977, the '''F2S Photomic''' used the '''DP-2''' head. Although it looked very different, the DP-2 was functionally very similar to the DP-1. It substituted an all-solid-state light-both-LEDs exposure control system using two arrow-shaped [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) over/underexposure indicators for better visibility in low light situations and better overall reliability. This was important, because the DP-2's CdS meter had better low-light sensitivity than the DP-1\u2014down to Exposure Value (EV) \u22122, instead of EV 1, at ASA 100. A chrome Nikon F2S Photomic with Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $961 in 1976. Note: SLRs were usually discounted 30 to 40 percent from list.\n\nWith the '''DP-3''' head, the camera became the '''F2SB Photomic''', available 1976 to 1977. The DP-3 introduced three innovations: a silicon photodiode light meter (a first for Nikon SLRs) for faster and more accurate light readings, a five-stage center-the-LED exposure control system using +/o/\u2212 LEDs, and an eyepiece blind.\n\nThese three early Photomic heads required Nikon F-mount lenses with a meter coupling shoe (\"rabbit ears\", see above). Rabbit ear lenses required a special mounting procedure. After mounting, the lens aperture ring must be turned back and forth to the smallest aperture (largest f-stop number) and then to the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number) to ensure that the lens and the head couple properly (Nippon Kogaku called it indexing the maximum aperture of the lens\u2014users called it the Nikon Shuffle!) and meter correctly. This system seems unwieldy to today's photographers, but it was second nature to Nikon and [[Nikkormat]] camera using photographers of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Image:Nikon-F2AS.jpg|thumb|A black body F2AS (incl DP-12 prism, as seen here) was very popular among photojournalists in the 1970s.]]\n[[Image:F2AScloseup.jpg|thumb|250|An F2AS (incl DP-12 prism). The EV metering range is a remarkable -2 to 17 with 100 ASA film.]]\nThe '''F2A Photomic''' came with the '''DP-11''' head; the '''F2AS Photomic''' used the '''DP-12''' head. The DP-11 and DP-12 (both introduced in 1977) functioned exactly the same as the DP-1 and DP-3, respectively, except that these heads supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977, see above). Nikkor AI lenses had a \"meter coupling ridge\" cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on a spring-loaded \"meter coupling lever\" on the Photomic head to transfer aperture setting information. AI lenses allowed carefree lens mounting and ended the double twisting that used to allow observers to spot a Nikon/Nikkormat user from a hundred paces. The F2AS Photomic (DP-12 head) was the most advanced F2 version and the chrome version with Nikkor AI 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $1,278 in 1978. (SLR selling prices were typically 30 to 40 percent below list.) This, the last version of the Nikon F2 Photomic, has become the most desired and collected F2 today.\n\nThe F2S Photomic (DP-2 head) and F2SB Photomic (DP-3 head) also accepted the unusual '''Nikon DS-1''' or '''DS-2 EE Aperture Control Units'''. The F2AS (DP-12) required the equivalent '''DS-12'''. These were early attempts by Nippon Kogaku to provide shutter priority autoexposure by having an electric servomotor automatically turn the lens aperture ring in response to the set shutter speed and light meter reading. The DS-1, -2 and -12 were bulky, slow and unreliable, and were feeble and inelegant attempts to add autoexposure to the manual exposure F2.\n\nThere were also three special purpose meterless heads available for the F2: the '''Nikon DW-1''' waist-level finder (a non-pentaprism head; look down directly at the mirror-reversed image on the focusing screen), the '''DA-1''' action finder (providing 60&nbsp;mm of eye relief; extremely large exit pupil that can be viewed while wearing face masks, safety goggles, etc.) and the '''DW-2''' 6X magnifying finder (waist-level finder with magnifier; good for precise focusing).\n\n==Focusing screens==\nThe F2 also had interchangeable viewfinder focusing screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard '''Type K''' screen had central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder and 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12&nbsp;mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.\n\nThe optional screens were:\n*'''Type A''' \u2013 central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Standard equipment with early F2s. Changeover to Type K occurred circa 1976.\n*'''Type B''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm focusing spot plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Useful for close ups and long telephotos.\n*'''Type C''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm clear spot with crosshair reticle. Very bright and useful for photo-microscopy, astrophotography, and parallax focusing method.\n*'''Type D''' \u2013 plain matte screen. Best screen for use with long telephotos with small apertures.\n*'''Type E''' \u2013 Type B with a grid of 5 horizontal and 3 vertical lines. Called \"architectural screen\" and excellent for \"Rule of Thirds\" pictorialist compositions. The most popular replacement screen.\n*'''Type G''' \u2013 central 12&nbsp;mm extra-bright microprism without matte background (cannot assess depth of field). Four versions (G1\u2013G4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type H''' \u2013 fullscreen extra-bright microprism; also cannot assess depth of field. Four versions (H1\u2013H4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Intended for sports photography, but not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type J''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm microprism plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle.\n*'''Type L''' \u2013 Type A, but with rangefinder set at a 45\u00b0 angle from lower left to upper right. Permits focusing on horizontal or vertical subjects.\n*'''Type M''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm double cross hairs with marked horizontal and vertical scales. Excellent for photo-microscopy.\n*'''Type P''' \u2013 Type L, but adds 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar and fullscreen crosshair. Originally marketed as the \"Apollo P screen,\" it was a screen favored by NASA on the bodies they acquired for their use.\n*'''Type R''' \u2013 Type E, but adds a 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder to the center of the screen.\n*'''Type S''' \u2013 for F2 Data (see below) only. Type A with etched marking for data imprint area.\n*'''Type T''' \u2013 for F2 Type A with etched markings for taking pictures of TV screens.\nThe combination and wide selection of heads and screens allowed photographers to customize their F2s to their heart's content.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive.jpg|thumb|Nikon MD-2 motor drive back without camera]]\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive front.jpg|thumb|MD-2 motor drive front with camera]]\nMajor accessories for the F2 included the '''Nikon MD-1''' (introduced in 1971) and '''MD-2''' (1973) [[motor drive]]s, providing automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a '''Nikon MB-1''' battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two '''Nikon MS-1''' battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate required that the F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two '''Nikon MN-1''' nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum advance rate is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.\n\nThe F2 also accepted the lighter, cheaper and less capable '''Nikon MD-3''' motor drive. The MD-3 did not have power rewind and had an advance rate of 2.5 frame/s with the standard '''MB-2''' battery pack holding 8 AA or LR6 batteries. Optionally, it could reach 3.5 frame/s with an MB-1 battery pack with 10 AA or LR6 batteries; 4 frame/s with MB-1 and MN-1 nicad battery.\n\nThe F2 could also mount the '''Nikon MF-1''' (33/10 feet/meters film = 250 frames; required two '''Nikon MZ-1''' film cassettes) and '''MF-2''' (100/30 feet/meters film = 750 frames; required two '''MZ-2''' film cassettes) bulk film backs. These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted and needed to take more than seven seconds' worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.\n\nStarting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku introduced the '''Nikon Speedlight SB-2''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-5''' (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-6''' (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and '''SB-7E''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) [[electronic flash]]es. Note that the F2 did not use a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can be connected to the Nikon shoe via the '''Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler'''.\n\nThe '''Nikon ML-1 Modulite''' was a wireless infrared remote controller with a 200/60 feet/meters line-of-sight range. It was a two part device: a handheld transmitter plus a camera mounted receiver. Note that the receiver needed to be connected to a motor drive. The '''Nikon MW-1''' was a similar device, but was larger and more powerful and used radio signals for a longer 2300/700 feet/meters obstructed view range. The MW-1 could also control three separate F2s by broadcasting three different codes.\n\nThe '''Nikon MT-1''' intervalometer allowed completely untended time lapse photography. It could fire the F2 for a specific number of frames at a particular shutter speed at set time intervals.\n\nNippon Kogaku also made scores of minor accessories for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction lenses, supplementary close-up lenses, lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced in excess of US$110,000\u2014the most extensive and expensive in the world.\n\n==Special F2 Versions==\nThere were several special purpose versions of the F2 manufactured in small numbers. Although they were all working cameras, today they are all rare collector's items.\n\n[[File:F2 titan noname.jpg|thumb|150px|F2 T]]\nThe '''F2T''' was a special ultra-rugged version of the F2 (DE-1 head) with [[titanium]] bayonet mount, top and bottom plates, and camera back, plus a special '''DE-1T''' titanium covered meterless prism head, sold in parallel with the regular F2s from 1978 to 1980. Most F2Ts were given a special textured black finish but a very few came in natural titanium finish, including the first F2Ts and the very last F2s ever manufactured. Their serial numbers began with '92', e.g., \"F2 9201544.'\n\nThe '''F2 Titan''' was a black only late variant of the F2T, distinguished by the word \"Titan\" engraved in Roman script on the front of the camera below the shutter release. They carry the number 79 in front of the serial number.\n\nThe H in the '''F2H''' of 1978 denoted \"High Speed\". It was yet another titanium-armored F2 but this time with a fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored '''Nikon MD-100''' high-speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The depth-of-field preview button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was a modified version of the MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film advance rate. The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other. The bodies (7-digit serial number) and motordrives (6-digit serial number) do not have matching serial numbers, contrary to often repeated misinformation. Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.\n\nAs the name implies, the '''F2 Data''' had a primitive data back. It used a tiny internal flash unit to imprint the time, date or sequential number on the film. This data back recorded the time by imprinting a tiny picture of a slightly less tiny [[Seiko]] made analogue clock onto the film. It also had a special insert plate that the photographer could write on and have this note imprinted on the film. There were two versions of the F2 Data: one with the '''MF-10''' camera back for standard 35&nbsp;mm film cartridges and one with the '''MF-11''' 250 frame bulk film back. The F2 Data also came packaged with an MD-2 motor drive and your choice of DE-1, DP-11 or DP-12 head plus a special Type S focusing screen that marked the left-side data imprint area. F2 Data bodies carry the numbers '77' in front of the serial number. Approximately 5,000 units were produced.\n\nFinally there was the '''F2A Anniversary''' model. This was marketed as a collector's item of 4,000 specially numbered bodies intended to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Nikon cameras in the USA. A plate was glued to the front of the camera below the shutter release noting, \"25th Anniversary\" (which has fallen off many bodies) and came in a special silver-colored box. The F2A Anniversary was not authorized by Nippon Kogaku; it was the creation of the American importer, Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries (EPOI).\n\n==Current status==\nBecause of the F2's durability, because there were so many manufactured (816,000 units) and because film SLRs have been largely replaced with digital equivalents in many markets, the F2 is still relatively common today and is available on the used market for low prices\u2014US$200\u2013400<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2.html Nikon F2 completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref> depending on the head. However, these may be well worn examples used by professional photographers and are generally in mediocre condition.\n\nThe Nikon F2 is also collectable. If a pristine F2 body and head with date-compatible serial numbers is found, it will carry collector's items price tags. The black body version of the F2AS model, in near new condition, can exceed $1,100 at auction.<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2AS.html Nikon F2 AS completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*\"Nikon MF/AF Bodies \u2013 Lens Compatibility\" http://www.nikonlinks.com/unklbil/bodylens.htm retrieved 3 January 2006\n* Anonymous. \"Modern Photography's Annual Guide to 47 Top Cameras: Nikon F2 Photomic\" p 117.

Local folk-theories of the language have often considered Swahili to be a [[mixed language]] because of its many loanwords from Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]], and the fact that the Swahili language emerged as a result of trade between the east African coastal Bantu-speaking tribes and traders from Arabia, Persia, Asia (south and southeast) as well as Europe (Portugal). However, historical linguists do not consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant enough to classify it as a mixed language, since Arabic influence is limited to lexical items, most of which have only been borrowed after 1500, while the grammatical and syntactic structure of the language is typically Bantu.<ref>Derek Nurse, Thomas T.

The Swahili language is a mix of several East African Bantu languages and Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] of traders that interacted with Bantu speaking communities at the [[Swahili coast]]. The Swahili language is a daughter language of the [[Pokomo language]] which is also known as Kingozi. Technically the [[Pokomo]] language is the pure Swahili without foreign loanwords. Most of the Bantu Swahili vocabulary is derived primarily from the Pokomo, Taita and Mijikenda languages and secondarily from other East African Bantu languages. Approximately 30% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] with Arabic contributing a majority of the foreign loan words in the Swahili language.

With  the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as teaching Islam to the local [[Bantu peoples]]. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic alphabet. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the [[Berlin conference]]. After seeing that there is already a widespread language the Germans decided to formalise it and made it the official language to be used in schools, thus schools in Swahili are called Shule(German = Schule), in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the first World war, Britain took over East Africa and found that Swahili was rooted in most areas East Africa and wasn't only spoken at the coastal regions, they decided to formalise it as language to be used across the East African region(although in British East Africa of Kenya and Uganda most areas used English and their native language while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter territorial conference attended by representatives of [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zanzibar]] took place in [[Mombasa]]. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/Swahili |title=Swahili |publisher=About World Languages}}</ref> and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lexikos.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/918/437 |title=Dictionaries and the Standardization of Spelling in Swahili |publisher=Lexikos | last=Mdee |first=James S. |volume=9 |year=1999 |pages=126\u201327 |access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Current status===\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three [[African Great Lakes]] countries ([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) where it is an official or national language while being the first language to many people in Tanzania especially along the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by local languages and dialects, and as a first language for most people born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. The widespread use of Swahili as a nation language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika got her independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. That saw the use of Swahili in all  levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children  are taught in Swahili, before switching to English in Secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). In 1985, with the 8\u20134\u20134 system of education, Swahili was made a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools.<ref name=\"laban\">{{cite news | last1=Wanambisi | first1=Laban | title=International schools must teach Kiswahili, Kenya's history \u2013 Matiang'i | url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/12/international-schools-must-teach-kiswahili-kenyas-history-matiangi/ | accessdate=8 December 2016 | agency=Capital News | date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in [[Burundi]], [[Comoros]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Rwanda]].<ref>Nurse & Thomas Spear (1985) ''The Swahili''</ref> The language was still understood in the southern ports of the [[Red Sea]] in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Kharusi\">{{cite journal | last=Kharusi | first=N.

Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Swahili, standardizing the language. Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation in the world that can approve its usage in the Swahili language.\nIn Kenya, ''Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa'' (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and propose means to which Kiswahili can be integrated to a national language.\n\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which [[language technology]] applications have been developed.

With the arrival of Arabs in East Africa they brought Islam and to which they set up Madrasas and used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more native were converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced in East Africa. While the Arabs were mostly centered at the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. With the first missionary posts in East Africa being located in the coastal areas, the missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity since it had a lot  of similarities with a lot of indigenous languages.\n\n=== Politics ===\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union|Tanganyika African  National Union]] used Swahili as language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language of the nation. Till this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity among the people and a sense of togetherness and for that Swahili remains a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Swahili for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Swahili]].}}\n\nUnlike the majority of Niger-Congo languages,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Niger-Congo-languages|title=Niger-Congo languages|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Swahili lacks [[Tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]] (pitch contour).

However, these long vowels are not considered to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]].

There are a few [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for native sounds, ''ch'' , ''sh'' , ''ng''' and ''ny''; ''q'' and ''x'' are not used,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/swahili/guide/alphabet.shtml |title=A Guide to Swahili \u2013 The Swahili alphabet |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> ''c'' is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for ''k'' in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\n\nThe language used to be written in the Arabic script. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.\n\n{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} were often conflated, but in some spellings, {{IPA|/e/}} was distinguished from {{IPA|/i/}} by rotating the ''[[kasrah|kasra]]'' 90\u00b0 and  {{IPA|/o/}} was distinguished from  {{IPA|/u/}} by writing the ''[[damma]]'' backwards.\n\nSeveral Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, [[Urdu script|Urdu]] script. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only did that mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute.

See [[Talk:Swahili language#The noun classes section needs an introduction]].|small=no|date=July 2019}}\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to [[gender]]s in other languages.  For example, just as suffix <-o> in Spanish marks masculine objects, and <-a> marks feminine ones, so, in Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: <m-> marks single human beings (''mtoto'' 'child'), <wa-> marks multiple humans (''watoto'' 'children'), <u-> marks abstract nouns (''utoto'' 'childhood'), and so on.  Similar prefixes must be used on verbs and particles in agreement with the governing noun in a phrase.  This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages of sub-Saharan Africa, and traces of it are also found in the other [[Niger-Congo]] languages of West Africa.\n\n====Semantic motivation====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe ''ki-/vi-'' class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are ''kisu'' \"knife\", ''kiti'' \"chair\" (from ''mti'' \"tree, wood\"), ''chombo'' \"vessel\" (a contraction of ''ki-ombo''). Examples of the latter are ''kitoto'' \"infant\", from ''mtoto'' \"child\"; ''kitawi'' \"frond\", from ''tawi'' \"branch\"; and ''chumba'' (''ki-umba'') \"room\", from ''nyumba'' \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is ''approximation'' and ''resemblance'' (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like ''-y'' or ''-ish'' in English). For example, there is ''kijani'' \"green\", from ''jani'' \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), ''kichaka'' \"bush\" from ''chaka'' \"clump\", and ''kivuli'' \"shadow\" from ''uvuli'' \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such ''instantiations'' (usually not very active ones) are found: ''kifo'' \"death\", from the verb ''-fa'' \"to die\"; ''kiota'' \"nest\" from ''-ota'' \"to brood\"; ''chakula'' \"food\" from ''kula'' \"to eat\"; ''kivuko'' \"a ford, a pass\" from ''-vuka'' \"to cross\"; and ''kilimia'' \"the [[Pleiades]]\", from ''-limia'' \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ''ki-/vi-'' prefixes. One example is ''chura'' (''ki-ura'') \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: ''kilema'' \"a cripple\", ''kipofu'' \"a blind person\", ''kiziwi'' \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for ''kifaru'' \"rhinoceros\", ''kingugwa'' \"spotted hyena\", and ''kiboko'' \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").\n\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the ''m-/mi-'' class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because ''mti, miti'' \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as ''mwitu'' 'forest' and ''mtama'' 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like ''mkeka'' 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as ''mwezi'' 'moon', ''mlima'' 'mountain', ''mto'' 'river'; active things, such as ''moto'' 'fire', including active body parts (''moyo'' 'heart', ''mkono'' 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as ''mji'' 'village', and, by analogy, ''mzinga'' 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of ''tree'', which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as ''mwavuli'' 'umbrella', ''moshi'' 'smoke', ''msumari'' 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as ''mfuo'' \"metal forging\", from ''-fua'' \"to forge\", or ''mlio'' \"a sound\", from ''-lia'' \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, ''mkono'' is an active body part, and ''mto'' is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as ''mpaka'' 'border' and ''mwendo'' 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as ''mwaka'' 'year' and perhaps ''mshahara'' 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\n\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.<ref>See Contini-Morava for details.</ref> In short,\n*Classes 1\u20132 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in ''-er.'' They include a couple of generic words for animals: ''mnyama'' 'beast', ''mdudu'' 'bug'.\n*Classes 5\u20136 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:\n**Augmentatives, such as ''joka'' 'serpent' from ''nyoka'' 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): ''Bwana'' 'Sir', ''shangazi'' 'aunt', ''fundi'' 'craftsman', ''kadhi'' 'judge'\n**Expanses: ''ziwa'' 'lake', ''bonde'' 'valley', ''taifa'' 'country', ''anga'' 'sky'\n***from this, mass nouns: ''maji'' 'water', ''vumbi'' 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), ''kaa'' 'charcoal', ''mali'' 'wealth', ''maridhawa'' 'abundance'\n**Collectives: ''kundi'' 'group', ''kabila'' 'language/ethnic group', ''jeshi'' 'army', ''daraja'' ' stairs', ''manyoya'' 'fur, feathers', ''mapesa'' 'small change', ''manyasi'' 'weeds', ''jongoo'' 'millipede' (large set of legs), ''marimba'' 'xylophone' (large set of keys)\n***from this, individual things found in groups: ''jiwe'' 'stone', ''tawi'' 'branch', ''ua'' 'flower', ''tunda'' 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), ''yai'' 'egg', ''mapacha'' 'twins', ''jino'' 'tooth', ''tumbo'' 'stomach' (cf. English \"guts\"), and paired body parts such as ''jicho'' 'eye', ''bawa'' 'wing', etc.\n***also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: ''neno'' 'a word', from ''kunena'' 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: ''wazo'' 'thought', ''maana'' 'meaning'); ''pigo'' 'a stroke, blow', from ''kupiga'' 'to hit'; ''gomvi'' 'a quarrel', ''shauri'' 'advice, plan', ''kosa'' 'mistake', ''jambo'' 'affair', ''penzi'' 'love', ''jibu'' 'answer', ''agano'' 'promise', ''malipo'' 'payment'\n***From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above\n*Classes 9\u201310 are used for most typical animals: ''ndege'' 'bird', ''samaki'' 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9\u201310 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9\u201310 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9\u201310 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.\n*Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an \"extended outline shape\", in either one dimension or two:\n**mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: ''uji'' 'porridge', ''wali'' 'cooked rice'\n**broad: ''ukuta'' 'wall', ''ukucha'' 'fingernail', ''upande'' 'side' (\u2248 ''ubavu'' 'rib'), ''wavu'' 'net', ''wayo'' 'sole, footprint', ''ua'' 'fence, yard', ''uteo'' 'winnowing basket'\n**long: ''utambi'' 'wick', ''utepe'' 'stripe', ''uta'' 'bow', ''ubavu'' 'rib', ''ufa'' 'crack', ''unywele'' 'a hair'\n***from 'a hair', [[singulative]]s of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: ''unyoya'' 'a feather', ''uvumbi'' 'a grain of dust', ''ushanga'' 'a bead'.\n*Class 14 are abstractions, such as ''utoto'' 'childhood' (from ''mtoto'' 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.\n*Class 15 are verbal infinitives.\n*Classes 16\u201318 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan ''mahali'' 'place(s)', but  in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: ''pahali'' 'place', ''mwahali'' 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix ''-ni'' takes class 16\u201318 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (\"at\"), class 17 if indefinite (\"around\") or involves motion (\"to, toward\"), and class 18 if it involves containment (\"within\"): ''mahali pazuri'' 'a good spot', ''mahali kuzuri'' 'a nice area', ''mahali muzuri'' (it's nice in there).\n\n===Agreement===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]], but if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1\u20132 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili ''(Kiswahili sanifu)'', based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-'' in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger ''i-, zi-''. Infinitives vary between standard ''ku-'' and reduced ''i-.''<ref>Kamil Ud Deen, 2005. ''The acquisition of Swahili''.</ref> (\"Of\" is animate ''wa'' and inanimate ''ya, za.'')\n\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-,'' and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Swahili noun-class concord\n|-\n!NC!!Semantic<br/>field!!Noun<br/>-C, -V!!Subj.!!Obj!!''-a''!!Adjective<br/>-C, -i, -e<ref group=\"*\">Most Swahili adjectives begin with either a consonant or the vowels ''i-'' or ''e-'', listed separately above.

Local folk-theories of the language have often considered Swahili to be a [[mixed language]] because of its many loanwords from Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]], and the fact that the Swahili language emerged as a result of trade between the east African coastal Bantu-speaking tribes and traders from Arabia, Persia, Asia (south and southeast) as well as Europe (Portugal). However, historical linguists do not consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant enough to classify it as a mixed language, since Arabic influence is limited to lexical items, most of which have only been borrowed after 1500, while the grammatical and syntactic structure of the language is typically Bantu.<ref>Derek Nurse, Thomas T.

The Swahili language is a mix of several East African Bantu languages and Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] of traders that interacted with Bantu speaking communities at the [[Swahili coast]]. The Swahili language is a daughter language of the [[Pokomo language]] which is also known as Kingozi. Technically the [[Pokomo]] language is the pure Swahili without foreign loanwords. Most of the Bantu Swahili vocabulary is derived primarily from the Pokomo, Taita and Mijikenda languages and secondarily from other East African Bantu languages. Approximately 30% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] with Arabic contributing a majority of the foreign loan words in the Swahili language. It was originally written  in [[Arabic script]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glcom.com/hassan/swahili_history.html |title=Swahili history |last=Juma |first=Abdurahman |publisher=glcom.com |url-status= |access-date=30 September 2017}}</ref> The Swahili language is by fact a [[creole language]] and/or hybrid language because it is mix of several East African Bantu languages with Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese and Malay and emerged as a result of interaction. \n\nThe earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies.

With  the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as teaching Islam to the local [[Bantu peoples]]. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic alphabet. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the [[Berlin conference]]. After seeing that there is already a widespread language the Germans decided to formalise it and made it the official language to be used in schools, thus schools in Swahili are called Shule(German = Schule), in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the first World war, Britain took over East Africa and found that Swahili was rooted in most areas East Africa and wasn't only spoken at the coastal regions, they decided to formalise it as language to be used across the East African region(although in British East Africa of Kenya and Uganda most areas used English and their native language while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter territorial conference attended by representatives of [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zanzibar]] took place in [[Mombasa]]. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/Swahili |title=Swahili |publisher=About World Languages}}</ref> and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lexikos.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/918/437 |title=Dictionaries and the Standardization of Spelling in Swahili |publisher=Lexikos | last=Mdee |first=James S. |volume=9 |year=1999 |pages=126\u201327 |access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Current status===\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three [[African Great Lakes]] countries ([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) where it is an official or national language while being the first language to many people in Tanzania especially along the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by local languages and dialects, and as a first language for most people born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. The widespread use of Swahili as a nation language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika got her independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. That saw the use of Swahili in all  levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children  are taught in Swahili, before switching to English in Secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). In 1985, with the 8\u20134\u20134 system of education, Swahili was made a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools.<ref name=\"laban\">{{cite news | last1=Wanambisi | first1=Laban | title=International schools must teach Kiswahili, Kenya's history \u2013 Matiang'i | url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/12/international-schools-must-teach-kiswahili-kenyas-history-matiangi/ | accessdate=8 December 2016 | agency=Capital News | date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in [[Burundi]], [[Comoros]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Rwanda]].<ref>Nurse & Thomas Spear (1985) ''The Swahili''</ref> The language was still understood in the southern ports of the [[Red Sea]] in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Kharusi\">{{cite journal | last=Kharusi | first=N.

Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Swahili, standardizing the language. Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation in the world that can approve its usage in the Swahili language.\nIn Kenya, ''Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa'' (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and propose means to which Kiswahili can be integrated to a national language.\n\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which [[language technology]] applications have been developed.

With the arrival of Arabs in East Africa they brought Islam and to which they set up Madrasas and used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more native were converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced in East Africa. While the Arabs were mostly centered at the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. With the first missionary posts in East Africa being located in the coastal areas, the missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity since it had a lot  of similarities with a lot of indigenous languages.\n\n=== Politics ===\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union|Tanganyika African  National Union]] used Swahili as language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language of the nation. Till this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity among the people and a sense of togetherness and for that Swahili remains a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Swahili for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Swahili]].}}\n\nUnlike the majority of Niger-Congo languages,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Niger-Congo-languages|title=Niger-Congo languages|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Swahili lacks [[Tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]] (pitch contour).

There are a few [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for native sounds, ''ch'' , ''sh'' , ''ng''' and ''ny''; ''q'' and ''x'' are not used,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/swahili/guide/alphabet.shtml |title=A Guide to Swahili \u2013 The Swahili alphabet |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> ''c'' is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for ''k'' in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\n\nThe language used to be written in the Arabic script. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.\n\n{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} were often conflated, but in some spellings, {{IPA|/e/}} was distinguished from {{IPA|/i/}} by rotating the ''[[kasrah|kasra]]'' 90\u00b0 and  {{IPA|/o/}} was distinguished from  {{IPA|/u/}} by writing the ''[[damma]]'' backwards.\n\nSeveral Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, [[Urdu script|Urdu]] script. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only did that mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute.

See [[Talk:Swahili language#The noun classes section needs an introduction]].|small=no|date=July 2019}}\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to [[gender]]s in other languages.  For example, just as suffix <-o> in Spanish marks masculine objects, and <-a> marks feminine ones, so, in Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: <m-> marks single human beings (''mtoto'' 'child'), <wa-> marks multiple humans (''watoto'' 'children'), <u-> marks abstract nouns (''utoto'' 'childhood'), and so on.  Similar prefixes must be used on verbs and particles in agreement with the governing noun in a phrase.  This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages of sub-Saharan Africa, and traces of it are also found in the other [[Niger-Congo]] languages of West Africa.\n\n====Semantic motivation====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe ''ki-/vi-'' class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are ''kisu'' \"knife\", ''kiti'' \"chair\" (from ''mti'' \"tree, wood\"), ''chombo'' \"vessel\" (a contraction of ''ki-ombo''). Examples of the latter are ''kitoto'' \"infant\", from ''mtoto'' \"child\"; ''kitawi'' \"frond\", from ''tawi'' \"branch\"; and ''chumba'' (''ki-umba'') \"room\", from ''nyumba'' \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is ''approximation'' and ''resemblance'' (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like ''-y'' or ''-ish'' in English). For example, there is ''kijani'' \"green\", from ''jani'' \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), ''kichaka'' \"bush\" from ''chaka'' \"clump\", and ''kivuli'' \"shadow\" from ''uvuli'' \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such ''instantiations'' (usually not very active ones) are found: ''kifo'' \"death\", from the verb ''-fa'' \"to die\"; ''kiota'' \"nest\" from ''-ota'' \"to brood\"; ''chakula'' \"food\" from ''kula'' \"to eat\"; ''kivuko'' \"a ford, a pass\" from ''-vuka'' \"to cross\"; and ''kilimia'' \"the [[Pleiades]]\", from ''-limia'' \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ''ki-/vi-'' prefixes. One example is ''chura'' (''ki-ura'') \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: ''kilema'' \"a cripple\", ''kipofu'' \"a blind person\", ''kiziwi'' \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for ''kifaru'' \"rhinoceros\", ''kingugwa'' \"spotted hyena\", and ''kiboko'' \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").\n\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the ''m-/mi-'' class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because ''mti, miti'' \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as ''mwitu'' 'forest' and ''mtama'' 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like ''mkeka'' 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as ''mwezi'' 'moon', ''mlima'' 'mountain', ''mto'' 'river'; active things, such as ''moto'' 'fire', including active body parts (''moyo'' 'heart', ''mkono'' 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as ''mji'' 'village', and, by analogy, ''mzinga'' 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of ''tree'', which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as ''mwavuli'' 'umbrella', ''moshi'' 'smoke', ''msumari'' 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as ''mfuo'' \"metal forging\", from ''-fua'' \"to forge\", or ''mlio'' \"a sound\", from ''-lia'' \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, ''mkono'' is an active body part, and ''mto'' is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as ''mpaka'' 'border' and ''mwendo'' 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as ''mwaka'' 'year' and perhaps ''mshahara'' 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\n\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.<ref>See Contini-Morava for details.</ref> In short,\n*Classes 1\u20132 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in ''-er.'' They include a couple of generic words for animals: ''mnyama'' 'beast', ''mdudu'' 'bug'.\n*Classes 5\u20136 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:\n**Augmentatives, such as ''joka'' 'serpent' from ''nyoka'' 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): ''Bwana'' 'Sir', ''shangazi'' 'aunt', ''fundi'' 'craftsman', ''kadhi'' 'judge'\n**Expanses: ''ziwa'' 'lake', ''bonde'' 'valley', ''taifa'' 'country', ''anga'' 'sky'\n***from this, mass nouns: ''maji'' 'water', ''vumbi'' 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), ''kaa'' 'charcoal', ''mali'' 'wealth', ''maridhawa'' 'abundance'\n**Collectives: ''kundi'' 'group', ''kabila'' 'language/ethnic group', ''jeshi'' 'army', ''daraja'' ' stairs', ''manyoya'' 'fur, feathers', ''mapesa'' 'small change', ''manyasi'' 'weeds', ''jongoo'' 'millipede' (large set of legs), ''marimba'' 'xylophone' (large set of keys)\n***from this, individual things found in groups: ''jiwe'' 'stone', ''tawi'' 'branch', ''ua'' 'flower', ''tunda'' 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), ''yai'' 'egg', ''mapacha'' 'twins', ''jino'' 'tooth', ''tumbo'' 'stomach' (cf. English \"guts\"), and paired body parts such as ''jicho'' 'eye', ''bawa'' 'wing', etc.\n***also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: ''neno'' 'a word', from ''kunena'' 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: ''wazo'' 'thought', ''maana'' 'meaning'); ''pigo'' 'a stroke, blow', from ''kupiga'' 'to hit'; ''gomvi'' 'a quarrel', ''shauri'' 'advice, plan', ''kosa'' 'mistake', ''jambo'' 'affair', ''penzi'' 'love', ''jibu'' 'answer', ''agano'' 'promise', ''malipo'' 'payment'\n***From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above\n*Classes 9\u201310 are used for most typical animals: ''ndege'' 'bird', ''samaki'' 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9\u201310 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9\u201310 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9\u201310 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.\n*Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an \"extended outline shape\", in either one dimension or two:\n**mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: ''uji'' 'porridge', ''wali'' 'cooked rice'\n**broad: ''ukuta'' 'wall', ''ukucha'' 'fingernail', ''upande'' 'side' (\u2248 ''ubavu'' 'rib'), ''wavu'' 'net', ''wayo'' 'sole, footprint', ''ua'' 'fence, yard', ''uteo'' 'winnowing basket'\n**long: ''utambi'' 'wick', ''utepe'' 'stripe', ''uta'' 'bow', ''ubavu'' 'rib', ''ufa'' 'crack', ''unywele'' 'a hair'\n***from 'a hair', [[singulative]]s of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: ''unyoya'' 'a feather', ''uvumbi'' 'a grain of dust', ''ushanga'' 'a bead'.\n*Class 14 are abstractions, such as ''utoto'' 'childhood' (from ''mtoto'' 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.\n*Class 15 are verbal infinitives.\n*Classes 16\u201318 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan ''mahali'' 'place(s)', but  in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: ''pahali'' 'place', ''mwahali'' 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix ''-ni'' takes class 16\u201318 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (\"at\"), class 17 if indefinite (\"around\") or involves motion (\"to, toward\"), and class 18 if it involves containment (\"within\"): ''mahali pazuri'' 'a good spot', ''mahali kuzuri'' 'a nice area', ''mahali muzuri'' (it's nice in there).\n\n===Agreement===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]], but if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1\u20132 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili ''(Kiswahili sanifu)'', based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-'' in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger ''i-, zi-''. Infinitives vary between standard ''ku-'' and reduced ''i-.''<ref>Kamil Ud Deen, 2005. ''The acquisition of Swahili''.</ref> (\"Of\" is animate ''wa'' and inanimate ''ya, za.'')\n\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-,'' and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Swahili noun-class concord\n|-\n!NC!!Semantic<br/>field!!Noun<br/>-C, -V!!Subj.!!Obj!!''-a''!!Adjective<br/>-C, -i, -e<ref group=\"*\">Most Swahili adjectives begin with either a consonant or the vowels ''i-'' or ''e-'', listed separately above.
