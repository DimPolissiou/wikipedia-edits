It has been the largest community in Tallapoosa County since 1910. It is known for [[Lake Martin]] with its {{convert|750|mi|km}} of wooded shoreline and {{convert|44,000|acre|ha}} of water. Lake Martin stands on the [[Tallapoosa River]] and offers boating, swimming, fishing, golfing, and camping. Many neighborhoods and luxury homes are located on the lake.\n\nThe city's economy was traditionally based on the textile industry, but in recent times its economic base has become more diversified as textile jobs have gone to India.\n\n==History==\nAlexander City was incorporated in 1872 as Youngsville, after its founder James Young. In 1873, the [[Savannah and Memphis Railroad]] came to the city. The city was renamed in honor of the railroad's President [[Edward Porter Alexander]], hero of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] for the Confederate States.<ref>[http://www.alexandercityonline.com/history.htm History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221115154/http://www.alexandercityonline.com/history.htm |date=2008-12-21 }}, City of Alexander City.</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 1902, at 1&nbsp;pm, a fire broke out in the Alexander City Machine shop and destroyed much of the town.

It has been the largest community in Tallapoosa County since 1910. It is known for [[Lake Martin]] with its {{convert|750|mi|km}} of wooded shoreline and {{convert|44,000|acre|ha}} of water. Lake Martin stands on the [[Tallapoosa River]] and offers boating, swimming, fishing, golfing, and camping. Many neighborhoods and luxury homes are located on the lake.\n\nThe city's economy was traditionally based on the textile industry, but in recent times its economic base has become more diversified as textile jobs have gone to India.\n\n==History==\nAlexander City was incorporated in 1872 as Youngsville, after its founder James Young. In 1873, the [[Savannah and Memphis Railroad]] came to the city. The city was renamed in honor of the railroad's President [[Edward Porter Alexander]], hero of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] for the Confederate States.<ref>[http://www.alexandercityonline.com/history.htm History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221115154/http://www.alexandercityonline.com/history.htm |date=2008-12-21 }}, City of Alexander City.</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 1902, at 1&nbsp;pm, a fire broke out in the Alexander City Machine shop and destroyed much of the town.

Formerly known as North Maryville, the town was incorporated under its present name in 1919.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early company town===\nShortly after the Pittsburgh Reduction Company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907, the company began investigating the possibility of establishing a large [[smelting]] operation in East Tennessee. The [[hydroelectric]] potential of the [[Little Tennessee River]], which exits the mountains about {{convert|20|mi}} southwest of Alcoa, was one of the primary incentives, as the company's aluminum smelting operation would require massive amounts of electricity. In 1910, the company established a base camp at what is now known as [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]], initially known as \"Alcoa\", and was known as such until the name was reapplied to the company's operations in North Maryville a few years later.<ref name=parker1>Russell Parker, \"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Early Years, 1919\u22121939.\"  ''East Tennessee Historical Society Publications'' Vol. 48 (1976), pp. 84-100.</ref>\n\nThe company considered several potential plant sites in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Etowah, Tennessee|Etowah]], and [[Monroe County, Tennessee|Monroe County]], but chose North Maryville due in part to the influence of Maryville mayor Samuel Everett (1864\u22121941).  By 1914, the company had completed the initial purchase of {{convert|700|acre|ha}} in North Maryville, and had initiated construction of the smelting plant and 150 houses for company employees. ALCOA's chief engineer Edwin Fickes and hydraulic engineer Robert Ewald drew up plans for the town to house the plant's workers. The town design initially called for the acquisition of {{convert|7500|acre|ha}}, and included four sections&mdash; Vose and Springbrook in the north (around what is now Springbrook Park) and Bassel and Hall in the south (around what is now the South Plant). Hall, named for the inventor of the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process|aluminum electrolytic process]], was originally a [[racial segregation|segregated]] community for the plant's African-American workers. Oldfield, a small community between the planned town and Maryville, would later be annexed by the city of Alcoa.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n[[World War I]] brought about a spike in the demand for aluminum, and the company quickly expanded its North Maryville operations. In 1919, a rolling mill (now West Plant) was completed, and the company purchased the Knoxville Power Company for its Little Tennessee Valley holdings. That same year, the company's town officially incorporated as \"Alcoa\". C.L. Babcock was the town's first mayor, and Victor Hultquist was the first city manager. Hultquist, who was also ALCOA's superintendent of construction, remained city manager until 1948, and oversaw much of the town's early development. In 1920, Alcoa had a population of 3,358 people living in 700 houses.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II===\nEarly Alcoa was a classic \"company town\", with the company maintaining a paternalistic relationship with the city. The city's welfare was almost wholly dependent upon the company's fortunes. This presented a problem for the company, which feared that its workforce would leave to look for jobs elsewhere during times of low production. Thus, during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the company maintained steady production levels in spite of the lack of demand for aluminum. Managers sought to cut workers' hours&mdash; which at one point dropped to 30 hours per week&mdash; rather than slash jobs. By the end of the decade, the company had stockpiled 42,000 tons of aluminum.<ref name=parker1 />\n\nThe Depression (and accompanying [[New Deal]] legislation) also brought about increased [[labor union]] activity in Alcoa. A strike in 1934 was forcibly ended when Hultquist deployed a large police force. A second strike in 1937 was broken in a similar fashion, with two striking workers shot and killed and the National Guard forced to intervene.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n[[World War II]] proved immensely profitable for ALCOA, as aluminum was needed for aircraft construction. Production increased 600% during the war, and the company's Alcoa operations workforce swelled to 12,000. In the early 1940s, the company built its North Plant, which at the time of its completion was the world's largest plant under a single roof.<ref name=parker2>Russell Parker, \"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Years of Change, 1940\u22121960.\"  ''East Tennessee Historical Society Publications'' Vol. 49 (1977), pp. 99-117.</ref>\n\n===Modern Alcoa===\nAfter World War II, the city of Alcoa became less and less dependent upon its parent company. ALCOA's public image had suffered due to its hardline stance toward labor unions, and in response, it launched a series of public relations initiatives, including the donation of land for schools, parks, and airport construction. The company also desegregated its facilities during this period. In the early 1950s, the company began selling off company housing to employees.<ref name=tehc>Tara Mitchel Mielnik, \"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=16 ALCOA, Inc.].\" ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002.

Formerly known as North Maryville, the town was incorporated under its present name in 1919.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early company town===\nShortly after the Pittsburgh Reduction Company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907, the company began investigating the possibility of establishing a large [[smelting]] operation in East Tennessee. The [[hydroelectric]] potential of the [[Little Tennessee River]], which exits the mountains about {{convert|20|mi}} southwest of Alcoa, was one of the primary incentives, as the company's aluminum smelting operation would require massive amounts of electricity. In 1910, the company established a base camp at what is now known as [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]], initially known as \"Alcoa\", and was known as such until the name was reapplied to the company's operations in North Maryville a few years later.<ref name=parker1>Russell Parker, \"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Early Years, 1919\u22121939.\"  ''East Tennessee Historical Society Publications'' Vol. 48 (1976), pp. 84-100.</ref>\n\nThe company considered several potential plant sites in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Etowah, Tennessee|Etowah]], and [[Monroe County, Tennessee|Monroe County]], but chose North Maryville due in part to the influence of Maryville mayor Samuel Everett (1864\u22121941).  By 1914, the company had completed the initial purchase of {{convert|700|acre|ha}} in North Maryville, and had initiated construction of the smelting plant and 150 houses for company employees. ALCOA's chief engineer Edwin Fickes and hydraulic engineer Robert Ewald drew up plans for the town to house the plant's workers. The town design initially called for the acquisition of {{convert|7500|acre|ha}}, and included four sections&mdash; Vose and Springbrook in the north (around what is now Springbrook Park) and Bassel and Hall in the south (around what is now the South Plant). Hall, named for the inventor of the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process|aluminum electrolytic process]], was originally a [[racial segregation|segregated]] community for the plant's African-American workers. Oldfield, a small community between the planned town and Maryville, would later be annexed by the city of Alcoa.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n[[World War I]] brought about a spike in the demand for aluminum, and the company quickly expanded its North Maryville operations. In 1919, a rolling mill (now West Plant) was completed, and the company purchased the Knoxville Power Company for its Little Tennessee Valley holdings. That same year, the company's town officially incorporated as \"Alcoa\". C.L. Babcock was the town's first mayor, and Victor Hultquist was the first city manager. Hultquist, who was also ALCOA's superintendent of construction, remained city manager until 1948, and oversaw much of the town's early development. In 1920, Alcoa had a population of 3,358 people living in 700 houses.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II===\nEarly Alcoa was a classic \"company town\", with the company maintaining a paternalistic relationship with the city. The city's welfare was almost wholly dependent upon the company's fortunes. This presented a problem for the company, which feared that its workforce would leave to look for jobs elsewhere during times of low production. Thus, during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the company maintained steady production levels in spite of the lack of demand for aluminum. Managers sought to cut workers' hours&mdash; which at one point dropped to 30 hours per week&mdash; rather than slash jobs. By the end of the decade, the company had stockpiled 42,000 tons of aluminum.<ref name=parker1 />\n\nThe Depression (and accompanying [[New Deal]] legislation) also brought about increased [[labor union]] activity in Alcoa. A strike in 1934 was forcibly ended when Hultquist deployed a large police force. A second strike in 1937 was broken in a similar fashion, with two striking workers shot and killed and the National Guard forced to intervene.<ref name=parker1 />\n\n[[World War II]] proved immensely profitable for ALCOA, as aluminum was needed for aircraft construction. Production increased 600% during the war, and the company's Alcoa operations workforce swelled to 12,000. In the early 1940s, the company built its North Plant, which at the time of its completion was the world's largest plant under a single roof.<ref name=parker2>Russell Parker, \"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Years of Change, 1940\u22121960.\"  ''East Tennessee Historical Society Publications'' Vol. 49 (1977), pp. 99-117.</ref>\n\n===Modern Alcoa===\nAfter World War II, the city of Alcoa became less and less dependent upon its parent company. ALCOA's public image had suffered due to its hardline stance toward labor unions, and in response, it launched a series of public relations initiatives, including the donation of land for schools, parks, and airport construction. The company also desegregated its facilities during this period.

[[Vietnam]] is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's crop, as of 2013.\n\nGround, dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a [[traditional medicine]]. Black pepper is the world's most traded [[spice]], and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound [[piperine]], which is a different kind of spicy from the [[capsaicin]] characteristic of [[chili pepper]]s. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a [[seasoning]], and is often paired with [[salt]] and available on dining tables in [[Salt and pepper shakers|shakers]] or [[Burr Mill|mills]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''pepper'' derives from [[Old English]] ''pipor'', [[Latin]] ''piper'', and [[Sanskrit]] ''pippali'' for \"long pepper\".<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pepper | title=Pepper (noun) | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper | date=2016 | accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref> In the 16th century, people began using ''pepper'' to also mean the unrelated [[New World]] [[chili pepper]] (genus ''[[Capsicum]]'').<ref name=oed/>\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Variants of Pepper.jpg|thumb| Six variants of peppercorns (two types of white and two types of black, based on region)]]\n\n=== Black pepper ===\nBlack pepper is produced from the still-green, unripe [[drupes|drupe]] of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean them and to prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures [[cell wall]]s in the pepper, speeding the work of [[browning (chemical process)|browning]] [[enzymes]] during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sun-dried without the boiling process.\n\nOnce the peppercorns are dried, pepper spirit and oil can be extracted from the berries by crushing them. Pepper spirit is used in many medicinal and beauty products. Pepper oil is also used as an [[ayurvedic]] massage oil and in certain beauty and herbal treatments.\n[[File:Spilled Pepper.jpg|thumb|Ground black pepper and a plastic [[Salt and pepper shakers|pepper shaker]]]]\n[[File:BlackPepperCorn.jpg|thumb|left|Roughly cracked black peppercorns, also known as ''mignonette'' or ''poivre mignonette'']]\n[[File:Dried Peppercorns.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black peppercorns on the left and white peppercorns on the right|Black and white peppercorns]]\n\n=== White pepper ===\n{{Redirect|White pepper|the Ween album|White Pepper}}\nWhite pepper consists solely of the seed of the ripe fruit of the pepper plant, with the thin darker-coloured skin (flesh) of the fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by a process known as [[retting]], where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week so the flesh of the peppercorn softens and [[decomposition|decomposes]]; rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/03/27/stories/2008032751741300.htm |title=Cleaner technology for white pepper production |work=The Hindu Business line |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509200302/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/03/27/stories/2008032751741300.htm |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGround white pepper is used commonly in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Portuguese cuisine]], but also in salads, [[White sauce|light-coloured sauces]], and [[mashed potatoes]] as a substitute, because black pepper would visibly stand out. However, white pepper lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe, resulting in a different overall flavour.\n\n=== Green pepper ===\nGreen pepper, like black pepper, is made from unripe drupes. Dried green peppercorns are treated in a way that retains the green colour, such as with [[sulphur dioxide]], [[canning]], or [[freeze-drying]]. [[Pickled]] peppercorns, also green, are unripe drupes preserved in [[brine]] or [[vinegar]].\n\nFresh, unpreserved green pepper drupes, largely unknown (and unavailable) in the West, are used in some [[Asian cuisine]]s, particularly [[Thai cuisine]]. Their flavour has been described as \"spicy and fresh\", with a \"bright aroma\".<ref>Ochef, [http://www.ochef.com/205.htm Using fresh green peppercorns].

Ripe red peppercorns can also be dried using the same colour-preserving techniques used to produce green pepper.<ref>Katzer, Gernot (2006).

Retrieved 2 December 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Pink pepper and other plants ===\n[[Pink peppercorn]]s are the fruits of the [[Peruvian pepper|Peruvian pepper tree]], ''Schinus molle'', or its relative, the [[Brazilian pepper|Brazilian pepper tree]], ''Schinus terebinthifolius,'' plants from a different family ([[Anacardiaceae]]). As they are members of the [[cashew]] family, they may cause [[allergic reactions]], including [[anaphylaxis]], for persons with a [[tree nut allergy]].\n\nThe bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' (\"canelo\" or \"winter's bark\") is used as a substitute for pepper in cold and temperate regions of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], where it is easily found and readily available. In [[New Zealand]], the seeds of [[Kawakawa (tree)|kawakawa]] (''Macropiper excelsum''), a [[Piperaceae|relative of black pepper]], are sometimes used as pepper; the leaves of ''[[Pseudowintera colorata]]'' (\"mountain horopito\") are another replacement for pepper. Several plants in the United States are also used as pepper substitutes, such as [[Lepidium campestre|field pepperwort]], [[Lepidium virginicum|least pepperwort]], [[shepherd's purse]], [[horseradish]], and [[field pennycress]].\n\n==Plants==\n[[File:Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) fruits.jpg|thumb|left|200x250px|Unripe drupes of ''P. nigrum'' (termed \"green pepper\") at [[Trivandrum]], [[Kerala]], India]]\nThe pepper plant is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[woody plant|woody]] [[vine]] growing up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height on supporting trees, poles, or trellises.

The plants are propagated by cuttings about {{convert|40|to|50|cm|abbr=on}} long, tied up to neighbouring trees or climbing frames at distances of about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} apart; trees with rough bark are favoured over those with smooth bark, as the pepper plants climb rough bark more readily. Competing plants are cleared away, leaving only sufficient trees to provide shade and permit free ventilation. The roots are covered in leaf [[mulch]] and [[manure]], and the shoots are trimmed twice a year. On dry soils, the young plants require watering every other day during the [[dry season]] for the first three years. The plants bear fruit from the fourth or fifth year, and then typically for seven years. The cuttings are usually [[cultivar]]s, selected both for yield and quality of fruit.\n\nA single stem bears 20 to 30 fruiting spikes. The harvest begins as soon as one or two fruits at the base of the spikes begin to turn red, and before the fruit is fully mature, and still hard; if allowed to ripen completely, the fruit lose pungency, and ultimately fall off and are lost.

The legacy of this trade remains in some Western legal systems that recognize the term \"[[peppercorn rent]]\" as a token payment for something that is, essentially, being given.\n\nThe ancient history of black pepper is often interlinked with (and confused with) that of [[long pepper]], the dried fruit of closely related ''Piper longum''. The Romans knew of both and often referred to either as just ''piper''. In fact, the popularity of long pepper did not entirely decline until the discovery of the New World and of [[chili pepper]]s. Chili peppers\u2014some of which, when dried, are similar in shape and taste to long pepper\u2014were easier to grow in a variety of locations more convenient to Europe.\n[[Image:Sa-pepper.jpg|thumb|right|Peppercorn close-up]]\nBefore the 16th century, pepper was being grown in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]], [[Sumatra]], [[Madagascar]], Malaysia, and everywhere in Southeast Asia. These areas traded mainly with China, or used the pepper locally.<ref>Dalby p. 93.</ref> Ports in the Malabar area also served as a stop-off point for much of the trade in other spices from farther east in the Indian Ocean. Following the British hegemony in India, virtually all of the black pepper found in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa was traded from [[Malabar region]].\n\n===Ancient times===\nBlack peppercorns were found stuffed in the nostrils of [[Ramesses II]], placed there as part of the [[mummy|mummification]] rituals shortly after his death in 1213 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J8mGcvFkatIC&pg=PT24 |title=Ramses II, Egyptian Pharaoh, Warrior, and Builder |author=Stephanie Fitzgerald |publisher=Compass Point Books |date=8 September 2008 |isbn=978-0-7565-3836-1 |page=88 |accessdate=29 January 2008 |quote=}}</ref> Little else is known about the use of pepper in [[ancient Egypt]] and how it reached the [[Nile]] from South Asia.\n\nPepper (both long and black) was known in Greece at least as early as the fourth century BCE, though it was probably an uncommon and expensive item that only the very rich could afford.\n\n[[File:Italy to India Route.svg|thumb|A Roman-era trade route from India to Italy]]\n\nBy the time of the early [[Roman Empire]], especially after Rome's conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE, open-ocean crossing of the Arabian Sea direct to Chera dynasty [[southern India]]'s Malabar Coast was near routine. Details of this trading across the Indian Ocean have been passed down in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''. According to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], the early empire sent a fleet of around 120 ships on an annual trip to India and back.<ref>Gary K. Young, Rome's Eastern Trade, 2001 p. 25 {{ISBN|0-415-24219-3}}</ref> The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea to take advantage of the predictable [[monsoon]] winds. Returning from India, the ships travelled up the [[Red Sea]], from where the cargo was carried overland or via the [[Canal of the Pharaohs|Nile-Red Sea canal]] to the Nile River, barged to [[Alexandria]], and shipped from there to Italy and Rome. The rough geographical outlines of this same trade route would dominate the pepper trade into Europe for a millennium and a half to come.\n\nWith ships sailing directly to the Malabar coast, [[Malabar pepper|Malabar black]] pepper was now travelling a shorter trade route than long pepper, and the prices reflected it. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' tells us the prices in Rome around 77 CE: \"Long pepper ... is 15 [[denarius|denarii]] per pound, while that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four.\" Pliny also complains, \"There is no year in which India does not drain the Roman Empire of 50 million [[sesterces]]\", and further moralizes on pepper:\n\n{{quote|It is quite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into fashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it is sometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance that has attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in it that can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, its only desirable quality being a certain pungency; and yet it is for this that we import it all the way from India! Who was the first to make trial of it as an article of food? and who, I wonder, was the man that was not content to prepare himself by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite?|Pliny, ''Natural History'' 12.14<ref>From Bostock and Riley's 1855 translation.

[[Apicius]]' ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', a third-century cookbook probably based at least partly on one from the first century CE, includes pepper in a majority of its recipes. [[Edward Gibbon]] wrote, in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', that pepper was \"a favorite ingredient of the most expensive Roman cookery\".\n\n===Postclassical Europe===\nPepper was so valuable that it was often used as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] or even currency. The taste for pepper (or the appreciation of its monetary value) was passed on to those who would see Rome fall. [[Alaric I|Alaric]], king of the [[Visigoths]], included 3,000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he besieged the city in fifth century.<ref>J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 134</ref> After the fall of Rome, others took over the middle legs of the [[spice trade]], first the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and then the [[Arab]]s; Innes Miller cites the account of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], who travelled east to India, as proof that \"pepper was still being exported from India in the sixth century\".<ref>Innes Miller, ''The Spice Trade'', p. 83</ref> By the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], the central portions of the spice trade were firmly under [[Islamic]] control. Once into the Mediterranean, the trade was largely monopolized by Italian powers, especially [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. The rise of these [[city-state]]s was funded in large part by the spice trade.\n\nA [[riddle]] authored by [[Saint Aldhelm]], a seventh-century [[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishop of Sherborne]], sheds some light on black pepper's role in England at that time:\n\n{{poemquote|I am black on the outside, clad in a wrinkled cover,\nYet within I bear a burning marrow.\nI season delicacies, the banquets of kings, and the luxuries of the table,\nBoth the sauces and the tenderized meats of the kitchen.\nBut you will find in me no quality of any worth,\nUnless your bowels have been rattled by my gleaming marrow.<ref>Translation from Turner, p 94. The riddle's answer is of course ''pepper''.</ref>}}\n\nIt is commonly believed that during the [[Middle Ages]], pepper was often used to conceal the taste of partially rotten meat. No evidence supports this claim, and historians view it as highly unlikely; in the Middle Ages, pepper was a [[luxury good|luxury item]], affordable only to the wealthy, who certainly had unspoiled meat available, as well.<ref>Dalby p. 156; also Turner pp. 108\u2013109, though Turner does go on to discuss spices (not pepper specifically) being used to disguise the taste of partially spoiled wine or ale.</ref> In addition, people of the time certainly knew that eating spoiled food would make them sick. Similarly, the belief that pepper was widely used as a preservative is questionable; it is true that [[piperine]], the compound that gives pepper its spiciness, has some antimicrobial properties, but at the concentrations present when pepper is used as a spice, the effect is small.<ref>{{cite journal |author1 =H.

However, pepper and other spices certainly played a role in improving the taste of long-preserved meats.\n\n[[Image:Calicut 1572.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A depiction of [[Kozhikode|Calicut, India]] published in 1572 during Portugal's control of the pepper trade]]\n\nIts exorbitant price during the Middle Ages \u2013 and the monopoly on the trade held by Italy \u2013 was one of the inducements that led the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to seek a sea route to India. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] became the first person to reach India by sailing around Africa (see [[Age of Discovery]]); asked by Arabs in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (who spoke Spanish and Italian) why they had come, his representative replied, \"we seek [[Christians]] and spices\". Though this first trip to India by way of the southern tip of Africa was only a modest success, the Portuguese quickly returned in greater numbers and eventually gained much greater control of trade on the Arabian Sea. The [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494 Treaty of Tordesillas]] with the Spanish granted Portugal exclusive rights to the half of the world where black pepper originated.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese proved unable to monopolize the spice trade. Older Arab and Venetian trade networks successfully imported enormous quantities of spices, and pepper once again flowed through Alexandria and Italy, as well as around Africa. In the 17th century, the Portuguese lost almost all of their valuable Indian Ocean trade to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[England|English]], who, taking advantage from the Spanish ruling over Portugal during [[Iberian Union]] (1580\u20131640), occupied by force almost all Portuguese dominations in the area. The pepper ports of Malabar began to trade increasingly with the Dutch in the period 1661\u20131663.\n[[Image:Le livre des merveilles de Marco Polo-pepper.jpg|thumb|Pepper harvested for the European trade, from a manuscript ''Livre des merveilles de [[Marco Polo]]'' (The book of the marvels of Marco Polo)]]\n[[File:K\u00e1v\u00e9dar\u00e1l\u00f3 (3).JPG|thumb|Pepper mill]]\nAs pepper supplies into Europe increased, the price of pepper declined (though the total value of the import trade generally did not). Pepper, which in the early Middle Ages had been an item exclusively for the rich, started to become more of an everyday seasoning among those of more average means. Today, pepper accounts for one-fifth of the world's spice trade.<ref>Jaffee, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===China===\nIt is possible that black pepper was known in [[China]] in the second century BCE, if poetic reports regarding an explorer named Tang Meng (\u5510\u8499) are correct. Sent by [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] to what is now south-west China, Tang Meng is said to have come across something called ''jujiang'' or \"sauce-betel\". He was told it came from the markets of [[Shu (state)|Shu]], an area in what is now the [[Sichuan]] province. The traditional view among historians is that \"sauce-betel\" is a sauce made from [[betel]] leaves, but arguments have been made that it actually refers to pepper, either long or black.<ref>Dalby pp. 74\u201375. The argument that ''jujiang'' was long pepper goes back to the fourth century CE botanical writings of Ji Han; Hui-lin Li's 1979 translation of and commentary on Ji Han's work makes the case that it was ''Piper nigrum''.</ref>\n\nIn the third century CE, black pepper made its first definite appearance in Chinese texts, as ''hujiao'' or \"foreign pepper\". It does not appear to have been widely known at the time, failing to appear in a fourth-century work describing a wide variety of spices from beyond China's southern border, including long pepper.<ref>Dalby p. 77.</ref> By the 12th century, however, black pepper had become a popular ingredient in the cuisine of the wealthy and powerful, sometimes taking the place of China's native [[Sichuan pepper]] (the tongue-numbing dried fruit of an unrelated plant).\n\n[[Marco Polo]] testifies to pepper's popularity in 13th-century China, when he relates what he is told of its consumption in the city of Kinsay ([[Hangzhou]]): \"...&nbsp;Messer Marco heard it stated by one of the Great Kaan's officers of customs that the quantity of pepper introduced daily for consumption into the city of Kinsay amounted to 43&nbsp;loads, each load being equal to 223&nbsp;lbs.\"<ref>[[Henry Yule|Yule, Henry]]; Cordier, Henri, Translation from [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/y#a5823 ''The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition], Vol. 2'', Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-27587-6}}. p. 204.</ref>\n[[File:White Pepper Grains.jpeg|left|thumb|White pepper grains]]\nDuring the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]] in the early 15th century, Admiral [[Zheng He]] and his expeditionary fleets returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay| first=Robert| title=The Voyages of Zheng He: Ideology, State Power, and Maritime Trade in Ming China| journal=Journal of the Historical Society| year=2008| volume=8| issue=3| page=337| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5923.2008.00250.x}}</ref>\n\n==Phytochemicals, folk medicine and research==\n[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 21.png|right|thumb|There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'

[[Vietnam]] is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's crop, as of 2013.\n\nGround, dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a [[traditional medicine]]. Black pepper is the world's most traded [[spice]], and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound [[piperine]], which is a different kind of spicy from the [[capsaicin]] characteristic of [[chili pepper]]s. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a [[seasoning]], and is often paired with [[salt]] and available on dining tables in [[Salt and pepper shakers|shakers]] or [[Burr Mill|mills]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''pepper'' derives from [[Old English]] ''pipor'', [[Latin]] ''piper'', and [[Sanskrit]] ''pippali'' for \"long pepper\".<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pepper | title=Pepper (noun) | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper | date=2016 | accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref> In the 16th century, people began using ''pepper'' to also mean the unrelated [[New World]] [[chili pepper]] (genus ''[[Capsicum]]'').<ref name=oed/>\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Variants of Pepper.jpg|thumb| Six variants of peppercorns (two types of white and two types of black, based on region)]]\n\n=== Black pepper ===\nBlack pepper is produced from the still-green, unripe [[drupes|drupe]] of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean them and to prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures [[cell wall]]s in the pepper, speeding the work of [[browning (chemical process)|browning]] [[enzymes]] during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sun-dried without the boiling process.\n\nOnce the peppercorns are dried, pepper spirit and oil can be extracted from the berries by crushing them. Pepper spirit is used in many medicinal and beauty products. Pepper oil is also used as an [[ayurvedic]] massage oil and in certain beauty and herbal treatments.\n[[File:Spilled Pepper.jpg|thumb|Ground black pepper and a plastic [[Salt and pepper shakers|pepper shaker]]]]\n[[File:BlackPepperCorn.jpg|thumb|left|Roughly cracked black peppercorns, also known as ''mignonette'' or ''poivre mignonette'']]\n[[File:Dried Peppercorns.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black peppercorns on the left and white peppercorns on the right|Black and white peppercorns]]\n\n=== White pepper ===\n{{Redirect|White pepper|the Ween album|White Pepper}}\nWhite pepper consists solely of the seed of the ripe fruit of the pepper plant, with the thin darker-coloured skin (flesh) of the fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by a process known as [[retting]], where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week so the flesh of the peppercorn softens and [[decomposition|decomposes]]; rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/03/27/stories/2008032751741300.htm |title=Cleaner technology for white pepper production |work=The Hindu Business line |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509200302/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/03/27/stories/2008032751741300.htm |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGround white pepper is used commonly in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Portuguese cuisine]], but also in salads, [[White sauce|light-coloured sauces]], and [[mashed potatoes]] as a substitute, because black pepper would visibly stand out. However, white pepper lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe, resulting in a different overall flavour.\n\n=== Green pepper ===\nGreen pepper, like black pepper, is made from unripe drupes. Dried green peppercorns are treated in a way that retains the green colour, such as with [[sulphur dioxide]], [[canning]], or [[freeze-drying]]. [[Pickled]] peppercorns, also green, are unripe drupes preserved in [[brine]] or [[vinegar]].\n\nFresh, unpreserved green pepper drupes, largely unknown (and unavailable) in the West, are used in some [[Asian cuisine]]s, particularly [[Thai cuisine]]. Their flavour has been described as \"spicy and fresh\", with a \"bright aroma\".<ref>Ochef, [http://www.ochef.com/205.htm Using fresh green peppercorns]. Retrieved 6 November 2005.</ref> They decay quickly if not dried or preserved, making them unsuitable for international shipping.\n\n=== Red peppercorns ===\nRed peppercorns usually consists of ripe peppercorn drupes preserved in brine and vinegar. Ripe red peppercorns can also be dried using the same colour-preserving techniques used to produce green pepper.<ref>Katzer, Gernot (2006). [http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Pipe_nig.html Pepper]. Gernot Katzer's Spice Pages. Retrieved 2 December 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Pink pepper and other plants ===\n[[Pink peppercorn]]s are the fruits of the [[Peruvian pepper|Peruvian pepper tree]], ''Schinus molle'', or its relative, the [[Brazilian pepper|Brazilian pepper tree]], ''Schinus terebinthifolius,'' plants from a different family ([[Anacardiaceae]]). As they are members of the [[cashew]] family, they may cause [[allergic reactions]], including [[anaphylaxis]], for persons with a [[tree nut allergy]].\n\nThe bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' (\"canelo\" or \"winter's bark\") is used as a substitute for pepper in cold and temperate regions of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], where it is easily found and readily available. In [[New Zealand]], the seeds of [[Kawakawa (tree)|kawakawa]] (''Macropiper excelsum''), a [[Piperaceae|relative of black pepper]], are sometimes used as pepper; the leaves of ''[[Pseudowintera colorata]]'' (\"mountain horopito\") are another replacement for pepper. Several plants in the United States are also used as pepper substitutes, such as [[Lepidium campestre|field pepperwort]], [[Lepidium virginicum|least pepperwort]], [[shepherd's purse]], [[horseradish]], and [[field pennycress]].\n\n==Plants==\n[[File:Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) fruits.jpg|thumb|left|200x250px|Unripe drupes of ''P. nigrum'' (termed \"green pepper\") at [[Trivandrum]], [[Kerala]], India]]\nThe pepper plant is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[woody plant|woody]] [[vine]] growing up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height on supporting trees, poles, or trellises. It is a spreading vine, rooting readily where trailing stems touch the ground. The leaves are alternate, entire, {{convert|5|to|10|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|to|6|cm|abbr=on}} across. The flowers are small, produced on pendulous spikes {{convert|4|to|8|cm|abbr=on}} long at the leaf nodes, the spikes lengthening up to {{convert|7|to|15|cm|abbr=on}} as the fruit matures.<ref name=\"Herbal Beast\"/> <!-- The fruit of the black pepper is called a drupe and when dried is known as a peppercorn.\n -->\nPepper can be grown in soil that is neither too dry nor susceptible to flooding, moist, well-drained and rich in organic matter (the vines do not do too well over an altitude of {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} above sea level). The plants are propagated by cuttings about {{convert|40|to|50|cm|abbr=on}} long, tied up to neighbouring trees or climbing frames at distances of about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} apart; trees with rough bark are favoured over those with smooth bark, as the pepper plants climb rough bark more readily. Competing plants are cleared away, leaving only sufficient trees to provide shade and permit free ventilation. The roots are covered in leaf [[mulch]] and [[manure]], and the shoots are trimmed twice a year. On dry soils, the young plants require watering every other day during the [[dry season]] for the first three years. The plants bear fruit from the fourth or fifth year, and then typically for seven years. The cuttings are usually [[cultivar]]s, selected both for yield and quality of fruit.\n\nA single stem bears 20 to 30 fruiting spikes. The harvest begins as soon as one or two fruits at the base of the spikes begin to turn red, and before the fruit is fully mature, and still hard; if allowed to ripen completely, the fruit lose pungency, and ultimately fall off and are lost. The spikes are collected and spread out to dry in the sun, then the peppercorns are stripped off the spikes.<ref name=\"Herbal Beast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.herbalbeast.com/black-pepper-cultivation-and-harvest/ |title=Black Pepper Cultivation and Harvest |publisher=Thompson Martinez |accessdate=14 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809123950/http://www.herbalbeast.com/black-pepper-cultivation-and-harvest/ |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBlack pepper is native either to [[Southeast Asia]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200005581 | work = Flora of China | title = Piper nigrum Linnaeus }}</ref> or [[South Asia]].<ref name=\"jaramillo\">{{Cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/88/4/706 | doi = 10.2307/2657072 | pmid = 11302858 | title = Phylogeny and Patterns of Floral Diversity in the Genus Piper (Piperaceae) | year = 2001 | author = Jaramillo, M.

The legacy of this trade remains in some Western legal systems that recognize the term \"[[peppercorn rent]]\" as a token payment for something that is, essentially, being given.\n\nThe ancient history of black pepper is often interlinked with (and confused with) that of [[long pepper]], the dried fruit of closely related ''Piper longum''. The Romans knew of both and often referred to either as just ''piper''. In fact, the popularity of long pepper did not entirely decline until the discovery of the New World and of [[chili pepper]]s. Chili peppers\u2014some of which, when dried, are similar in shape and taste to long pepper\u2014were easier to grow in a variety of locations more convenient to Europe.\n[[Image:Sa-pepper.jpg|thumb|right|Peppercorn close-up]]\nBefore the 16th century, pepper was being grown in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]], [[Sumatra]], [[Madagascar]], Malaysia, and everywhere in Southeast Asia.

Details of this trading across the Indian Ocean have been passed down in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''. According to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], the early empire sent a fleet of around 120 ships on an annual trip to India and back.<ref>Gary K. Young, Rome's Eastern Trade, 2001 p. 25 {{ISBN|0-415-24219-3}}</ref> The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea to take advantage of the predictable [[monsoon]] winds. Returning from India, the ships travelled up the [[Red Sea]], from where the cargo was carried overland or via the [[Canal of the Pharaohs|Nile-Red Sea canal]] to the Nile River, barged to [[Alexandria]], and shipped from there to Italy and Rome. The rough geographical outlines of this same trade route would dominate the pepper trade into Europe for a millennium and a half to come.\n\nWith ships sailing directly to the Malabar coast, [[Malabar pepper|Malabar black]] pepper was now travelling a shorter trade route than long pepper, and the prices reflected it. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' tells us the prices in Rome around 77 CE: \"Long pepper ... is 15 [[denarius|denarii]] per pound, while that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four.\" Pliny also complains, \"There is no year in which India does not drain the Roman Empire of 50 million [[sesterces]]\", and further moralizes on pepper:\n\n{{quote|It is quite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into fashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it is sometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance that has attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in it that can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, its only desirable quality being a certain pungency; and yet it is for this that we import it all the way from India! Who was the first to make trial of it as an article of food? and who, I wonder, was the man that was not content to prepare himself by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite?|Pliny, ''Natural History'' 12.14<ref>From Bostock and Riley's 1855 translation.

[[Apicius]]' ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', a third-century cookbook probably based at least partly on one from the first century CE, includes pepper in a majority of its recipes. [[Edward Gibbon]] wrote, in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', that pepper was \"a favorite ingredient of the most expensive Roman cookery\".\n\n===Postclassical Europe===\nPepper was so valuable that it was often used as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] or even currency. The taste for pepper (or the appreciation of its monetary value) was passed on to those who would see Rome fall. [[Alaric I|Alaric]], king of the [[Visigoths]], included 3,000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he besieged the city in fifth century.<ref>J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 134</ref> After the fall of Rome, others took over the middle legs of the [[spice trade]], first the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and then the [[Arab]]s; Innes Miller cites the account of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], who travelled east to India, as proof that \"pepper was still being exported from India in the sixth century\".<ref>Innes Miller, ''The Spice Trade'', p. 83</ref> By the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], the central portions of the spice trade were firmly under [[Islamic]] control. Once into the Mediterranean, the trade was largely monopolized by Italian powers, especially [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. The rise of these [[city-state]]s was funded in large part by the spice trade.\n\nA [[riddle]] authored by [[Saint Aldhelm]], a seventh-century [[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishop of Sherborne]], sheds some light on black pepper's role in England at that time:\n\n{{poemquote|I am black on the outside, clad in a wrinkled cover,\nYet within I bear a burning marrow.\nI season delicacies, the banquets of kings, and the luxuries of the table,\nBoth the sauces and the tenderized meats of the kitchen.\nBut you will find in me no quality of any worth,\nUnless your bowels have been rattled by my gleaming marrow.<ref>Translation from Turner, p 94. The riddle's answer is of course ''pepper''.</ref>}}\n\nIt is commonly believed that during the [[Middle Ages]], pepper was often used to conceal the taste of partially rotten meat. No evidence supports this claim, and historians view it as highly unlikely; in the Middle Ages, pepper was a [[luxury good|luxury item]], affordable only to the wealthy, who certainly had unspoiled meat available, as well.<ref>Dalby p. 156; also Turner pp. 108\u2013109, though Turner does go on to discuss spices (not pepper specifically) being used to disguise the taste of partially spoiled wine or ale.</ref> In addition, people of the time certainly knew that eating spoiled food would make them sick. Similarly, the belief that pepper was widely used as a preservative is questionable; it is true that [[piperine]], the compound that gives pepper its spiciness, has some antimicrobial properties, but at the concentrations present when pepper is used as a spice, the effect is small.<ref>{{cite journal |author1 =H.

However, pepper and other spices certainly played a role in improving the taste of long-preserved meats.\n\n[[Image:Calicut 1572.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A depiction of [[Kozhikode|Calicut, India]] published in 1572 during Portugal's control of the pepper trade]]\n\nIts exorbitant price during the Middle Ages \u2013 and the monopoly on the trade held by Italy \u2013 was one of the inducements that led the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to seek a sea route to India. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] became the first person to reach India by sailing around Africa (see [[Age of Discovery]]); asked by Arabs in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (who spoke Spanish and Italian) why they had come, his representative replied, \"we seek [[Christians]] and spices\". Though this first trip to India by way of the southern tip of Africa was only a modest success, the Portuguese quickly returned in greater numbers and eventually gained much greater control of trade on the Arabian Sea. The [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494 Treaty of Tordesillas]] with the Spanish granted Portugal exclusive rights to the half of the world where black pepper originated.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese proved unable to monopolize the spice trade. Older Arab and Venetian trade networks successfully imported enormous quantities of spices, and pepper once again flowed through Alexandria and Italy, as well as around Africa. In the 17th century, the Portuguese lost almost all of their valuable Indian Ocean trade to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[England|English]], who, taking advantage from the Spanish ruling over Portugal during [[Iberian Union]] (1580\u20131640), occupied by force almost all Portuguese dominations in the area. The pepper ports of Malabar began to trade increasingly with the Dutch in the period 1661\u20131663.\n[[Image:Le livre des merveilles de Marco Polo-pepper.jpg|thumb|Pepper harvested for the European trade, from a manuscript ''Livre des merveilles de [[Marco Polo]]'' (The book of the marvels of Marco Polo)]]\n[[File:K\u00e1v\u00e9dar\u00e1l\u00f3 (3).JPG|thumb|Pepper mill]]\nAs pepper supplies into Europe increased, the price of pepper declined (though the total value of the import trade generally did not). Pepper, which in the early Middle Ages had been an item exclusively for the rich, started to become more of an everyday seasoning among those of more average means. Today, pepper accounts for one-fifth of the world's spice trade.<ref>Jaffee, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===China===\nIt is possible that black pepper was known in [[China]] in the second century BCE, if poetic reports regarding an explorer named Tang Meng (\u5510\u8499) are correct. Sent by [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] to what is now south-west China, Tang Meng is said to have come across something called ''jujiang'' or \"sauce-betel\". He was told it came from the markets of [[Shu (state)|Shu]], an area in what is now the [[Sichuan]] province. The traditional view among historians is that \"sauce-betel\" is a sauce made from [[betel]] leaves, but arguments have been made that it actually refers to pepper, either long or black.<ref>Dalby pp. 74\u201375. The argument that ''jujiang'' was long pepper goes back to the fourth century CE botanical writings of Ji Han; Hui-lin Li's 1979 translation of and commentary on Ji Han's work makes the case that it was ''Piper nigrum''.</ref>\n\nIn the third century CE, black pepper made its first definite appearance in Chinese texts, as ''hujiao'' or \"foreign pepper\". It does not appear to have been widely known at the time, failing to appear in a fourth-century work describing a wide variety of spices from beyond China's southern border, including long pepper.<ref>Dalby p. 77.</ref> By the 12th century, however, black pepper had become a popular ingredient in the cuisine of the wealthy and powerful, sometimes taking the place of China's native [[Sichuan pepper]] (the tongue-numbing dried fruit of an unrelated plant).\n\n[[Marco Polo]] testifies to pepper's popularity in 13th-century China, when he relates what he is told of its consumption in the city of Kinsay ([[Hangzhou]]): \"...&nbsp;Messer Marco heard it stated by one of the Great Kaan's officers of customs that the quantity of pepper introduced daily for consumption into the city of Kinsay amounted to 43&nbsp;loads, each load being equal to 223&nbsp;lbs.\"<ref>[[Henry Yule|Yule, Henry]]; Cordier, Henri, Translation from [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/y#a5823 ''The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition], Vol. 2'', Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-27587-6}}. p. 204.</ref>\n[[File:White Pepper Grains.jpeg|left|thumb|White pepper grains]]\nDuring the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]] in the early 15th century, Admiral [[Zheng He]] and his expeditionary fleets returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay| first=Robert| title=The Voyages of Zheng He: Ideology, State Power, and Maritime Trade in Ming China| journal=Journal of the Historical Society| year=2008| volume=8| issue=3| page=337| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5923.2008.00250.x}}</ref>\n\n==Phytochemicals, folk medicine and research==\n[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 21.png|right|thumb|There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'

Long pepper, being stronger, was often the preferred medication, but both were used.
