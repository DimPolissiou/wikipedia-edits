This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a [[bank run]]. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Federal Reserve Board\">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2003/20031024/default.htm | format=text | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}\n\n====Lender of last resort====\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector \"clearing houses\" which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l lender of last resort], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]], Retrieved May 21, 2010,</ref><ref>{{cite document|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas M.|title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History|ssrn=2125371|publisher=Social Science Research Network|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>\n\n====Fluctuations====\nThrough its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).\n\nBy making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<ref name=\"dfeverydayecon\"/> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85&nbsp;billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).<ref name=\"Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16\">{{cite web | url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm | title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16\">\n{{cite news | first=Edmund L. | last= Andrews |first2= Michael J. |last2=de la Merced |first3=Mary Williams |last3=Walsh | title= Fed's $85 Billion Loan Rescues Insurer | date=September 16, 2008 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html | newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate =September 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Central bank===\n{{Further|Central bank}}\n[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]\n\nIn its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.<ref name=\"Fed_currency\">{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | url= http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html | title=How Currency Gets into Circulation |date=June 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> During the [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.<ref name=\"Bureau_cost\">{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |url=http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |title=Annual Production Figures |access-date=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125657/http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |archive-date=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}http://www.bep.treas.gov/resources/productionannual.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bep.gov/images/2013_CFO_Report.pdf |title=Chief Financial Officer Performance and Accountability Report |website=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |page=25 |access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Federal funds====\n{{Main|Federal funds}}\n\nFederal funds are the reserve balances (also called [[Federal Reserve Deposits]]) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.<ref name=\"fed funds\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html | title=Federal Funds | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/special_reports/instruments_of_the_money_market/pdf/full_publication.pdf |editor-first=Timothy Q. |editor-last=Cook|editor2-first=Robert K.|editor2-last=Laroche | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | title=Instruments of the Money Market | year=1993 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.\n\nFederal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.\n\n===Bank regulation===\nThe Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm | title=Speech \u2013 Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.\n\nThe legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}\n\nThe balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\n====Government regulation and supervision====\n[[File:House Financial Services Committee hearing with Ben Bernanke.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Bernanke (lower-right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing on February 10, 2009.

The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] supervises national banks, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] supervises [[state bank]]s that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSome regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [[state bank]]s that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], such as the [[Truth in Lending Act|Truth in Lending]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Equal Credit Opportunity]], and [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]s. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.\n\nMembers of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.\n\nThe Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}\n\nThere is a very strong economic consensus in favor of independence from political influence.<ref name=\"igmchicago.org\">http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments</ref>\n\n=====Regulatory and oversight responsibilities=====\nThe board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in United States Code:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/301- | title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301.

The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.}}\n\n===National payments system===\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system.

The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [[open market operations]], the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThere is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.<ref name=\"igmchicago.org\"/>\n\n===Federal Advisory Council===\n{{Main|Federal Advisory Council}}\n\nThe Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction.\n\n===Federal Reserve Banks===\n{{Main|Federal Reserve Bank}}\n[[File:Federal Reserve Districts Map - Banks & Branches.png|upright=1.8|right|thumb|Map of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, with the twelve Federal Reserve Banks marked as black squares, and all Branches within each district (24 total) marked as red circles.

What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]] gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.<ref name=\"mp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm | title= Federal Open Market Committee | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 22, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"mpb\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/pagenotfound?aspxerrorpath=/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153340/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm|url-status=dead|title=We Apologize|archive-date=January 5, 2010|website=www.federalreserveeducation.org}}</ref>\n\n===Interbank lending===\nThe Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [[federal funds rate]], which is the rate of interbank lending of [[excess reserves]]. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three \"tools\" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:\n\n{{quote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.<ref name=\"BoG 2005 pp=27\"/>}}\n\nEffects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Federal Reserve System in Action | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | access-date=November 24, 2012 | year=2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nThere are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks:<ref name=\"mp\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tool\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Open market operations]]\n|Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities{{nsmdns}}the Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years.

This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.\n\nOpen market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called \"Treasury bills\" or more informally \"T-bills\" or \"Treasuries\". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.<ref name=\"FRB of NY\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operations | publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank |date=August 2007 | accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:<ref name=\"mpb\"/>\n\n{{quote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.\n\nOpen market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.\n\nThe Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}\n\n=====Repurchase agreements=====\n{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}\n\nTo smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html | title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York | website=Ny.frb.org |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Discount rate====\n{{Further|Discount window}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve System also directly sets the \"discount rate\", which is the interest rate for \"discount window lending\", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed.

By removing \"excess deposits\" from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that:\n\n{{quote| Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy. The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100430a.htm | title=Federal Reserve Board approves amendments to Regulation D authorizing Reserve Banks to offer term deposits | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=April 30, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five \"small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100510b.htm | title=Board authorizes small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100908a.htm | title=Board authorizes ongoing small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=September 8, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News:\n\n{{quote| Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than $1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zumbrun | first = Joshua | title = Fed to Sell Term Deposits to Ensure Exit 'Readiness' | work = Bloomberg | date = September 8, 2010 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-08/fed-to-sell-5-billion-of-term-deposits-to-ensure-readiness-.html | accessdate = September 10, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms:\n\n{{quote| Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....\n\nAs an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.\n\nWhen these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.<ref>[http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 Testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding \"Unwinding Emergency Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs and Implications for Economic Recovery.\" March 25, 2010.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007044419/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 |date=October 7, 2010 }} https://web.archive.org/web/20151015224731/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087, also at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/useftp.cgi?IPaddress=162.140.64.184&filename=56764.pdf&directory=/diska/wais/data/111_house_hearings GPO Access Serial No. 111\u2013118] Retrieved September 10, 2010</ref>}}\n\n=====Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility=====\nThe Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF.

Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3&nbsp;trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify.

This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a [[bank run]]. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Federal Reserve Board\">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2003/20031024/default.htm | format=text | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}\n\n====Lender of last resort====\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector \"clearing houses\" which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l lender of last resort], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]], Retrieved May 21, 2010,</ref><ref>{{cite document|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas M.|title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History|ssrn=2125371|publisher=Social Science Research Network|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>\n\n====Fluctuations====\nThrough its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).\n\nBy making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<ref name=\"dfeverydayecon\"/> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85&nbsp;billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).<ref name=\"Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16\">{{cite web | url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm | title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16\">\n{{cite news | first=Edmund L. | last= Andrews |first2= Michael J. |last2=de la Merced |first3=Mary Williams |last3=Walsh | title= Fed's $85 Billion Loan Rescues Insurer | date=September 16, 2008 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html | newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate =September 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Central bank===\n{{Further|Central bank}}\n[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]\n\nIn its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.<ref name=\"Fed_currency\">{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | url= http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html | title=How Currency Gets into Circulation |date=June 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> During the [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.<ref name=\"Bureau_cost\">{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |url=http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |title=Annual Production Figures |access-date=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125657/http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |archive-date=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}http://www.bep.treas.gov/resources/productionannual.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bep.gov/images/2013_CFO_Report.pdf |title=Chief Financial Officer Performance and Accountability Report |website=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |page=25 |access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Federal funds====\n{{Main|Federal funds}}\n\nFederal funds are the reserve balances (also called [[Federal Reserve Deposits]]) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.<ref name=\"fed funds\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html | title=Federal Funds | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/special_reports/instruments_of_the_money_market/pdf/full_publication.pdf |editor-first=Timothy Q. |editor-last=Cook|editor2-first=Robert K.|editor2-last=Laroche | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | title=Instruments of the Money Market | year=1993 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.\n\nFederal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.\n\n===Bank regulation===\nThe Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm | title=Speech \u2013 Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.\n\nThe legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}\n\nThe balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\n====Government regulation and supervision====\n[[File:House Financial Services Committee hearing with Ben Bernanke.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Bernanke (lower-right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing on February 10, 2009. Members of the board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one. The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the [[Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]].]]\n\nThe Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions Federal Reserve System |access-date=February 19, 2010 |quote=The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Reserve System as a whole are all subject to several levels of audit and review.

Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the board of governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3).

A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks<ref>See example: {{cite web |url=http://www.state.ar.us/bank/benefits_advantages.html |publisher=Arkansas State Bank Department |title=Advantages of Being/Becoming a State Chartered Bank |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that are members of the Federal Reserve System, [[Bank holding company|bank holding companies]] (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and [[Edge Act]] and \"agreement corporations\" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] supervises national banks, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] supervises [[state bank]]s that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSome regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [[state bank]]s that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], such as the [[Truth in Lending Act|Truth in Lending]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Equal Credit Opportunity]], and [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]s. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.\n\nMembers of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.\n\nThe Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}\n\nThere is a very strong economic consensus in favor of independence from political influence.<ref name=\"igmchicago.org\">http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments</ref>\n\n=====Regulatory and oversight responsibilities=====\nThe board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in United States Code:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/301- | title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301.

The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.}}\n\n===National payments system===\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [[Fedwire|Fedwire Funds Service]] and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Main|Structure of the Federal Reserve System}}\n[[File:FederalReserve System.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Organization of the Federal Reserve System]]\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has a \"unique structure that is both public and private\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Role of the Federal Reserve System|url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm|website=Innovation and Education: Renewing the Northeast Ohio Economy|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]]|access-date=June 24, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315065708/http://clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm|archive-date=March 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}{{cite web |url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208042053/https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |archive-date=December 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and is described as \"[[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent within the government]]\" rather than \"[[Privatization|independent of government]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm|website=Who Owns the Federal Reserve?|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}</ref> The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal.<ref name=FRBPhilPubPriv>[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/teachers/resources/fed-today/fed-today_lesson-3.pdf \"Is The Fed Public Or Private?\"] [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]].

The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [[open market operations]], the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThere is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.<ref name=\"igmchicago.org\"/>\n\n===Federal Advisory Council===\n{{Main|Federal Advisory Council}}\n\nThe Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction.\n\n===Federal Reserve Banks===\n{{Main|Federal Reserve Bank}}\n[[File:Federal Reserve Districts Map - Banks & Branches.png|upright=1.8|right|thumb|Map of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, with the twelve Federal Reserve Banks marked as black squares, and all Branches within each district (24 total) marked as red circles.

The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three \"tools\" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:\n\n{{quote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.<ref name=\"BoG 2005 pp=27\"/>}}\n\nEffects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Federal Reserve System in Action | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | access-date=November 24, 2012 | year=2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nThere are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks:<ref name=\"mp\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tool\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Open market operations]]\n|Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities{{nsmdns}}the Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy.

This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.\n\nOpen market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called \"Treasury bills\" or more informally \"T-bills\" or \"Treasuries\". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.<ref name=\"FRB of NY\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operations | publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank |date=August 2007 | accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:<ref name=\"mpb\"/>\n\n{{quote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.\n\nOpen market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.\n\nThe Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}\n\n=====Repurchase agreements=====\n{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}\n\nTo smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html | title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York | website=Ny.frb.org |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Discount rate====\n{{Further|Discount window}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve System also directly sets the \"discount rate\", which is the interest rate for \"discount window lending\", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed.

As stated in Bloomberg News:\n\n{{quote| Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than $1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zumbrun | first = Joshua | title = Fed to Sell Term Deposits to Ensure Exit 'Readiness' | work = Bloomberg | date = September 8, 2010 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-08/fed-to-sell-5-billion-of-term-deposits-to-ensure-readiness-.html | accessdate = September 10, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms:\n\n{{quote| Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....\n\nAs an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.\n\nWhen these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.<ref>[http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 Testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding \"Unwinding Emergency Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs and Implications for Economic Recovery.\" March 25, 2010.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007044419/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 |date=October 7, 2010 }} https://web.archive.org/web/20151015224731/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087, also at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/useftp.cgi?IPaddress=162.140.64.184&filename=56764.pdf&directory=/diska/wais/data/111_house_hearings GPO Access Serial No. 111\u2013118] Retrieved September 10, 2010</ref>}}\n\n=====Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility=====\nThe Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF.

It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called \"Annual Report: Budget Review\".
