Magne was not sure if he would win the race, because that stage would be over cobbles, on which the Belgian cyclists were considered experts. The night before the stage, Magne could not sleep, and his roommate Leducq suggested that he could read some fan mail. Magne considered reading fan mail before the race was over as giving bad luck, but one oversized letter made him curious.<ref name=\"revealed\"/> Magne opened it, and read a letter from a fan who claimed that Belgian cyclist [[Gaston Rebry]] (who had won the 1931 [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]] race over the same cobbles) had written to his mother that he was planning to attack on the penultimate stage, together with Jef Demuysere. Leducq thought the letter was a joke, but Magne did not take the risk and told his teammates to stay close to Rebry and Demuysere.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=100\u2013103}}\nAfter 60&nbsp;km, Rebry and Demuysere took off, and Magne followed them. The Belgians took turns to attack Magne, but they could not get away from him.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=100\u2013103}} They finished more than seventeen minutes ahead of Pesenti, which secured the victory for Magne and had Demuysere overtake Pesenti for the second place.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Results==\n\nIn stages 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12, the national teams started 10 minutes before the touriste-routiers; in all other stages all cyclists started together. The cyclist to reach the finish in the least time was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], these times were added together. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\n\nThe team classification was calculated by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per team; the team with the least time was the winner.\n\n===Stage winners===\n\nFive stages were won by touriste-routiers: Stages 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17, the highest number of stages ever won by touriste-routiers.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=100\u2013103}}\n[[File:Fabio Battesini.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with a dirty face holding his bicycle, spare tires wrapped around his shoulders.

For the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], these times were added together. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\n\nThe team classification was calculated by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per team; the team with the least time was the winner.\n\n===Stage winners===\n\nFive stages were won by touriste-routiers: Stages 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17, the highest number of stages ever won by touriste-routiers.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=100\u2013103}}\n[[File:Fabio Battesini.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with a dirty face holding his bicycle, spare tires wrapped around his shoulders.

Rome's expansion into southern Italy probably made it inevitable that it would eventually clash with Carthage over Sicily on some pretext.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=166\u2013167}} The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]).{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nBy 241&nbsp;BC the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to defeat the Carthaginians decisively and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} In 260 BC the Romans built a large fleet and over the following ten years defeated the Carthaginians in a succession of naval battles.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100, 107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}} The Romans also slowly gained control of most of Sicily, including the major cities of [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (modern Agrigento; Agrigentum in Latin; captured in 262 BC) and Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]; captured in 254 BC).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=158}}\n\n== Prelude ==\nDuring 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}} In 250 BC the [[Roman Senate]] decided to raise an army to decisively put an end to the fighting in [[Sicily]]. To this end, a new fleet was commissioned to be made up of 240 ships. The two [[Roman consul|consuls]] that year were sent to Sicily at the head of four [[Roman legion|legions]]. The Roman forces were likely made up of up to 100,000 men, including the crews of galleys and the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]] that normally accompanied the legions.  In 250&nbsp;BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but [[Battle of Panormus|were defeated]], losing most of their elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}} Contemporary accounts do not report either side's other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nBy mid-250 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, \n\nCaius Atilius Regulus Serranus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus both had significant military experience having both previously served as consuls. The Romans arrived at [[Lilybaeum]] and began their siege of the city, building siege works around the city including [[Battering ram|rams]], walls, [[trenches]], [[catapult]]s and [[siege tower]]s. They further attempted to mine underneath the city walls and to block the city's port with their fleet.\n\nThe Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]], but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n== Siege ==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nThe Carthaginian force was based, up to this point, almost exclusively on a force of 10,000 [[mercenaries]] inside the city.  Historically, Carthage had typically relied on mercenary armies and did not maintain its own standing army. According to the historian [[Polybius]], many of the mercenary captains gathered together and decided to desert to the Roman side after fears were raised that they did not stand a chance against the Romans. The Carthaginian command gained knowledge of this plot through [[Alexon]] and the traitors were not allowed to return to the city once they entered the Roman camp. The loyalty of the remaining mercenaries was thereafter not in question and the city was shortly thereafter reinforced by fresh troops from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. The fleet that brought these reinforcements sailed to the Carthaginian base at modern day [[Trapani]] (then called Drepana) and were able to consistently run the Roman blockade of Lilybaeum to bring supplies to the town.\n\nAfter a storm destroyed the Roman defensive works protecting their siege craft, the Carthaginians came out of the city on sorties and set most of the Roman siege weapons on fire, destroying them. \n\nPulcher decided to attack the Carthaginian fleet, which was in the harbour of the nearby city of Drepana (modern Trapani). The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack, but became scattered in the dark. The Carthaginian commander [[Adherbal (admiral)|Adherbal]] was able to lead his fleet out to sea before they were trapped and counter-attacked in the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Romans were pinned against the shore and after a hard day's fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013121}} Carthage turned to the maritime offensive, inflicting another heavy naval defeat at the [[Battle of Phintias]] and all but swept the Romans from the sea.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=88\u201391}} It was to be seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=163}}\n\nThe Romans attempted to reroute all trade away from the city in an effort to isolate Drepana. In response, Carthage designated [[Hamilcar Barca]], the Carthaginian chief of Sicily in 247 BC to concentrate his forces elsewhere on the island.\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on a captured blockade runner with especially good qualities.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding, and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there to use as marines.

Rome's expansion into southern Italy probably made it inevitable that it would eventually clash with Carthage over Sicily on some pretext.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=166\u2013167}} The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]).{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nBy 241&nbsp;BC the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to defeat the Carthaginians decisively and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} In 260 BC the Romans built a large fleet and over the following ten years defeated the Carthaginians in a succession of naval battles.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100, 107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}} The Romans also slowly gained control of most of Sicily, including the major cities of [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (modern Agrigento; Agrigentum in Latin; captured in 262 BC) and Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]; captured in 254 BC).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=158}}\n\n== Prelude ==\nDuring 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}} In 250 BC the [[Roman Senate]] decided to raise an army to decisively put an end to the fighting in [[Sicily]]. To this end, a new fleet was commissioned to be made up of 240 ships. The two [[Roman consul|consuls]] that year were sent to Sicily at the head of four [[Roman legion|legions]]. The Roman forces were likely made up of up to 100,000 men, including the crews of galleys and the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]] that normally accompanied the legions.  In 250&nbsp;BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but [[Battle of Panormus|were defeated]], losing most of their elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}} Contemporary accounts do not report either side's other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nBy mid-250 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, \n\nCaius Atilius Regulus Serranus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus both had significant military experience having both previously served as consuls. The Romans arrived at [[Lilybaeum]] and began their siege of the city, building siege works around the city including [[Battering ram|rams]], walls, [[trenches]], [[catapult]]s and [[siege tower]]s. They further attempted to mine underneath the city walls and to block the city's port with their fleet.\n\nThe Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]], but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n== Siege ==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nThe Carthaginian force was based, up to this point, almost exclusively on a force of 10,000 [[mercenaries]] inside the city.  Historically, Carthage had typically relied on mercenary armies and did not maintain its own standing army. According to the historian [[Polybius]], many of the mercenary captains gathered together and decided to desert to the Roman side after fears were raised that they did not stand a chance against the Romans. The Carthaginian command gained knowledge of this plot through [[Alexon]] and the traitors were not allowed to return to the city once they entered the Roman camp. The loyalty of the remaining mercenaries was thereafter not in question and the city was shortly thereafter reinforced by fresh troops from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. The fleet that brought these reinforcements sailed to the Carthaginian base at modern day [[Trapani]] (then called Drepana) and were able to consistently run the Roman blockade of Lilybaeum to bring supplies to the town.\n\nAfter a storm destroyed the Roman defensive works protecting their siege craft, the Carthaginians came out of the city on sorties and set most of the Roman siege weapons on fire, destroying them. \n\nPulcher decided to attack the Carthaginian fleet, which was in the harbour of the nearby city of Drepana (modern Trapani). The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack, but became scattered in the dark. The Carthaginian commander [[Adherbal (admiral)|Adherbal]] was able to lead his fleet out to sea before they were trapped and counter-attacked in the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Romans were pinned against the shore and after a hard day's fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013121}} Carthage turned to the maritime offensive, inflicting another heavy naval defeat at the [[Battle of Phintias]] and all but swept the Romans from the sea.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=88\u201391}} It was to be seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=163}}\n\nThe Romans attempted to reroute all trade away from the city in an effort to isolate Drepana. In response, Carthage designated [[Hamilcar Barca]], the Carthaginian chief of Sicily in 247 BC to concentrate his forces elsewhere on the island.\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on a captured blockade runner with especially good qualities.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding, and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there to use as marines.

Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily.

In 1929, he had removed the sponsors, but this had had no effect; the Alcyon team members still cooperated and managed to let [[Maurice Dewaele]] win the race, even though he was sick.\nFor 1930, Desgrange replaced the trade teams by national teams. He gave up on the idea that he could keep team tactics away from the Tour, but decided that he could still try to keep commercial team tactics away.<ref name=\"veloarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1930.php|title=1930: The coming of national teams|author=Tom James|date=15 August 2003|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>\nThe race started with five national teams of eight cyclists each, completed by 60 touriste-routiers.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/><ref name=\"mdc1930\"/> All cyclists raced on identical, yellow-coloured bicycles.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nThe trade teams did not like the national teams, because they lost the publicity during the most important race of the season, while they still had to pay for the riders' salary. The trade teams used to supply food, transport and lodging for the cyclists during the race, but now the Tour organisation had to pay for all this. To pay for this, the publicity caravan was started.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} In 1930, only three companies were in that publicity caravan, but it has grown since.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} The most popular sponsor in the publicity was Menier chocolates, whose advertising manager had advised the Tour organisation to start the publicity caravan; 500.000 fans came to the Tour de France stages early to receive chocolate handouts.<ref name=\"revealed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1930.htm|publisher=Cycling revealed|author=Barry Boyce|year=2004|title=New ideas!

This had caused [[Victor Fontan]] to quit the race while he was leading. In 1930, this rule was abandoned, and from now on, cyclists could get help when they had mechanical problems.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nFrom 1927 to 1929, some stages were run in the team-time-trial format.

The cyclist who led the general classification, and therefore wore the yellow jersey, received the ''Maillot d'or'' (French for ''golden jersey''), which was 1000 francs for every stage. The best touriste-routier in the general classification received the ''Maillot d'argent'' (French for ''silver jersey''), which was 500 francs per stage. Despite the name, there was no silver jersey worn by the best touriste-routier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1223|title=Le myst\u00e8re du maillot argent r\u00e9solu|date=5 July 2005|accessdate=18 July 2013|language=French|publisher=Cyclismag|first=Sandrine|last=Viollet|author2=Turgis, Dominique|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215419/http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1223|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1930 Tour de France}}\n\nFor the first time, the Tour was run with national teams.

The Italian [[Learco Guerra]] dominated the race. For the general classification, no big things happened, except for the fall of [[Alfredo Binda]] in the seventh stage, which caused him to lose one hour, and abandon his hopes for the Tour victory.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} Binda won the eighth and ninth stage, before he dropped out in the tenth stage.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\nIn the ninth stage, touriste-routier [[Beno\u00eet Faur\u00e9]] led the race over the first mountains, and dropped many cyclists.

[[Learco Guerra]], second placed in the general classification with a margin of more than 16 minutes, saw an opportunity and was away as fast as he could, together with [[Jef Demuysere]]. Just before the climb of the [[Col du T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe]], Leducq's pedal broke. His teammate [[Marcel Bidot]] got a pedal from a spectator's bicycle. Leducq thought of abandoning the race, but he was convinced by his teammates to get back on his bicycle. They had 60&nbsp;km to go, and managed to get back to Guerra. In the end, Leducq even managed to win the sprint.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nWith no more mountain stages to come, Leducq had secured his victory. Charles P\u00e9lissier made the victory of the French team even more glorious, as he won the last four stages.\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\nIn all stages, all cyclists started together. The cyclist to reach the finish first was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], these times were added together; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\n\nThe touriste-routiers had been divided into regional teams, for which a separate team classification was made. The South-East team became the winner of this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1930\"/> For ''touriste-routiers'', cyclists that were not part of national teams, there were additional awards. The best-placed touriste-routier received a prize, but was not identified by a jersey. Some of the touriste-routiers were assigned to a regional team. A regional team classification was also made, according to the same rules as the national team classification.\n\nThe organing newspaper, [[l'Auto]] named a ''meilleur grimpeur'' (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern [[King of the Mountains]] competition. This award was won by [[Beno\u00eet Faur\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-giro-vuelta.net|title=Tour-giro-vuelta|accessdate=29 September 2009|author=Michiel van Lonkhuyzen}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time, there was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team competition]]. The team classification was calculated in 1930 by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per national team; the national team with the least time was the winner.

This format proved to be a very successful format for the French riders, six of which placed in the top ten. Andr\u00e9 Leducq was the star of the French team, winning the overall classification, however, Charles P\u00e9lissier, who finished ninth overall achieved a stunning eight stage wins.<ref name=\"letour.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1930/histoire.html|title=The Tour - Year 1930|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|accessdate=30 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716154747/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1930/histoire.html|archive-date=16 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1930 was the first year of the publicity caravan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.letour.fr/2008/TDF/COURSE/us/histoire_home.html |title=Le Tour (official site), History, 1930 |access-date=27 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615022439/http://www.letour.fr/2008/TDF/COURSE/us/histoire_home.html |archive-date=15 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nTour director [[Henri Desgrange]] had tried many things to remove the team tactics from the Tour de France, because he wanted the race to be won on individual strength. In 1929, he had removed the sponsors, but this had had no effect; the Alcyon team members still cooperated and managed to let [[Maurice Dewaele]] win the race, even though he was sick.\nFor 1930, Desgrange replaced the trade teams by national teams. He gave up on the idea that he could keep team tactics away from the Tour, but decided that he could still try to keep commercial team tactics away.<ref name=\"veloarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1930.php|title=1930: The coming of national teams|author=Tom James|date=15 August 2003|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>\nThe race started with five national teams of eight cyclists each, completed by 60 touriste-routiers.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/><ref name=\"mdc1930\"/> All cyclists raced on identical, yellow-coloured bicycles.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nThe trade teams did not like the national teams, because they lost the publicity during the most important race of the season, while they still had to pay for the riders' salary. The trade teams used to supply food, transport and lodging for the cyclists during the race, but now the Tour organisation had to pay for all this. To pay for this, the publicity caravan was started.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} In 1930, only three companies were in that publicity caravan, but it has grown since.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} The most popular sponsor in the publicity was Menier chocolates, whose advertising manager had advised the Tour organisation to start the publicity caravan; 500.000 fans came to the Tour de France stages early to receive chocolate handouts.<ref name=\"revealed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1930.htm|publisher=Cycling revealed|author=Barry Boyce|year=2004|title=New ideas!

This had caused [[Victor Fontan]] to quit the race while he was leading. In 1930, this rule was abandoned, and from now on, cyclists could get help when they had mechanical problems.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nFrom 1927 to 1929, some stages were run in the team-time-trial format. This was completely abandoned in 1930.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nThe first live radio broadcast from the Tour de France happened in 1930.<ref name=\"letour.fr\"/>\n\nTwo extra prizes were given in 1930, donated by the Soors brothers from ''Grand Sport''. The cyclist who led the general classification, and therefore wore the yellow jersey, received the ''Maillot d'or'' (French for ''golden jersey''), which was 1000 francs for every stage. The best touriste-routier in the general classification received the ''Maillot d'argent'' (French for ''silver jersey''), which was 500 francs per stage. Despite the name, there was no silver jersey worn by the best touriste-routier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1223|title=Le myst\u00e8re du maillot argent r\u00e9solu|date=5 July 2005|accessdate=18 July 2013|language=French|publisher=Cyclismag|first=Sandrine|last=Viollet|author2=Turgis, Dominique|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215419/http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1223|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1930 Tour de France}}\n\nFor the first time, the Tour was run with national teams. Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany and France each sent a team composed of eight cyclists. Additionally, 60 cyclists started as ''touriste-routiers'', most of them French.

The Italian [[Learco Guerra]] dominated the race. For the general classification, no big things happened, except for the fall of [[Alfredo Binda]] in the seventh stage, which caused him to lose one hour, and abandon his hopes for the Tour victory.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}} Binda won the eighth and ninth stage, before he dropped out in the tenth stage.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\nIn the ninth stage, touriste-routier [[Beno\u00eet Faur\u00e9]] led the race over the first mountains, and dropped many cyclists. In the end, he was dropped by Binda, Leducq, Pierre Magne and Antonin Magne.\n\nIn the sixteenth stage, going down from the [[Col du Galibier|Galibier]], the leader of the race [[Andr\u00e9 Leducq]] fell down.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> He lost consciousness, and when he woke up, [[Pierre Magne (cyclist)|Pierre Magne]] put him back on his bicycle, and his French teammates helped him to get back. [[Learco Guerra]], second placed in the general classification with a margin of more than 16 minutes, saw an opportunity and was away as fast as he could, together with [[Jef Demuysere]]. Just before the climb of the [[Col du T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe]], Leducq's pedal broke. His teammate [[Marcel Bidot]] got a pedal from a spectator's bicycle. Leducq thought of abandoning the race, but he was convinced by his teammates to get back on his bicycle. They had 60&nbsp;km to go, and managed to get back to Guerra. In the end, Leducq even managed to win the sprint.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=94\u2013100}}\n\nWith no more mountain stages to come, Leducq had secured his victory. Charles P\u00e9lissier made the victory of the French team even more glorious, as he won the last four stages.\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\nIn all stages, all cyclists started together. The cyclist to reach the finish first was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], these times were added together; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\n\nThe touriste-routiers had been divided into regional teams, for which a separate team classification was made. The South-East team became the winner of this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1930\"/> For ''touriste-routiers'', cyclists that were not part of national teams, there were additional awards. The best-placed touriste-routier received a prize, but was not identified by a jersey. Some of the touriste-routiers were assigned to a regional team. A regional team classification was also made, according to the same rules as the national team classification.\n\nThe organing newspaper, [[l'Auto]] named a ''meilleur grimpeur'' (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern [[King of the Mountains]] competition. This award was won by [[Beno\u00eet Faur\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-giro-vuelta.net|title=Tour-giro-vuelta|accessdate=29 September 2009|author=Michiel van Lonkhuyzen}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time, there was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team competition]]. The team classification was calculated in 1930 by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per national team; the national team with the least time was the winner.

His hedonistic ways are however temporary halted when his Uncle Charlie dies and Custer is pitted against his relatives. His Uncle leaves Custer a fortune in the will, but only on the condition that he marries and has a child within 12 months, otherwise it all goes to his relatives.

It is noted for [[Bill Murray]]'s first film appearance in a starring role and for launching the directing career of Reitman, whose later comedies included ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981) and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), both starring Murray. The film also introduced teenage actor [[Chris Makepeace]] in the role of Rudy Gerner. It was followed by several [[sequel]]s, of which only ''[[Meatballs III: Summer Job]]'' (1986) had any connection to the original.\n\n==Plot==\nTripper Harrison is the head counsellor of a group of new counsellors-in-training (CITs) at Camp North Star, a cut-rate [[summer camp]] located in [[Upstate New York]]. Camp director Morty Melnick (called Mickey by everyone, a play on [[Mickey Mouse#Origin|Mortimer Mouse]]) falls victim to Tripper-led practical jokes, mainly by being taken from his cabin in the middle of the night and waking up in unusual places.\n\nRudy Gerner, a lonely boy who is sent to summer camp by his [[workaholic]] father, decides to run away from camp. Noticing Rudy is shy and having difficulty fitting in, Tripper tracks Rudy to a nearby bus station and takes him under his wing. Each morning they go jogging and rapidly bond as friends. Tripper helps Rudy gain confidence while Rudy encourages the reluctant Tripper to start a romance with Roxanne, the girl's head counsellor. Love is also in the air for many of the CITs; Candace \"kidnaps\" Crockett in a speedboat and confesses her feelings for him. Wheels, who had broken up with A.L. the year before, successfully rekindles their relationship during a dance. The nerdy Spaz develops a crush on Jackie.\n\nA subplot deals with North Star's rivalry with Camp Mohawk, a wealthy summer camp located across the lake. During a basketball game, North Star is being beaten by Mohawk when they attempt their own perverse form of victory. This sets the stage for the yearly [[Olympiad]] held between the camps in which Mohawk carries a 12\u20130 record.\n\nDuring the first day of competition, Mohawk dominates North Star, cheating in many cases to win. Crockett fails to clear the high jump bar, Hardware gets pummelled in boxing, and Jackie suffers a broken leg in [[field hockey]], thanks to the dirty work of two Mohawk girls. The score at the end of Day One is: Mohawk 170, North Star 63. That evening at the North Star Lodge, Tripper gives a rousing speech, telling the demoralized campers that it doesn't matter whether they win or lose. In unison, Camp North Star begins to chant, \"It just doesn't matter!\" Day Two of the Olympiad belongs to newly inspired North Star as they win every event. Wheels outwrestles his opponent, Spaz defeats Rhino in a stacking contest with inspiration from Jackie and a thwarted Mohawk cheating attempt, and, after 12 years of North Star defeats, Fink finally beats \"The Stomach\" in the hot dog eating contest. North Star now trails by only 10 points with one event left, a four-mile [[cross country running|cross country run]] for 20 points. Tripper steps forward and selects a surprised Rudy to compete against Horse, Mohawk's star runner. The many mornings Rudy spent jogging and training with Tripper pay off as he wins the race, giving North Star its first Olympiad victory by a score of 230\u2013220.\n\nLater that evening, Morty, Tripper, Roxanne, and the CITs sing around a campfire and say their final goodbyes as the camp prepares to close at the end of summer. Rudy has already decided to return to camp next year and Roxanne agrees to live with Tripper. The two ride off on Tripper's motorcycle, leading the buses out of camp and leaving Morty behind, in bed, on a raft in the middle of the lake.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Tripper\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Morty (\"Mickey\")\n* [[Kate Lynch]] as Roxanne\n* [[Russ Banham]] as Crockett\n* [[Kristine DeBell]] as A.L.\n* Sarah Torgov as Candace\n* [[Jack Blum]] as Spaz\n* [[Keith Knight (actor)|Keith Knight]] as Fink\n* Cindy Girling as Wendy\n* Todd Hoffman as Wheels\n* Margot Pinvidic as Jackie\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Hardware (billed as Matt Cravenn)\n* Norma Dell\u2019Agnese as Brenda\n* [[Chris Makepeace]] as Rudy\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Critical response {{anchor|Critics}} ==\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 72% based on 36 reviews.

[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] issued a special-edition DVD (with an anamorphic transfer, a [[audio commentary|director's commentary]], and a \"Making of\" featurette) on June 5, 2007. The sequels did not receive the same treatment of re-release.

It is noted for [[Bill Murray]]'s first film appearance in a starring role and for launching the directing career of Reitman, whose later comedies included ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981) and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), both starring Murray. The film also introduced teenage actor [[Chris Makepeace]] in the role of Rudy Gerner. It was followed by several [[sequel]]s, of which only ''[[Meatballs III: Summer Job]]'' (1986) had any connection to the original.\n\n==Plot==\nTripper Harrison is the head counsellor of a group of new counsellors-in-training (CITs) at Camp North Star, a cut-rate [[summer camp]] located in [[Upstate New York]]. Camp director Morty Melnick (called Mickey by everyone, a play on [[Mickey Mouse#Origin|Mortimer Mouse]]) falls victim to Tripper-led practical jokes, mainly by being taken from his cabin in the middle of the night and waking up in unusual places.\n\nRudy Gerner, a lonely boy who is sent to summer camp by his [[workaholic]] father, decides to run away from camp. Noticing Rudy is shy and having difficulty fitting in, Tripper tracks Rudy to a nearby bus station and takes him under his wing. Each morning they go jogging and rapidly bond as friends. Tripper helps Rudy gain confidence while Rudy encourages the reluctant Tripper to start a romance with Roxanne, the girl's head counsellor. Love is also in the air for many of the CITs; Candace \"kidnaps\" Crockett in a speedboat and confesses her feelings for him. Wheels, who had broken up with A.L. the year before, successfully rekindles their relationship during a dance. The nerdy Spaz develops a crush on Jackie.\n\nA subplot deals with North Star's rivalry with Camp Mohawk, a wealthy summer camp located across the lake. During a basketball game, North Star is being beaten by Mohawk when they attempt their own perverse form of victory. This sets the stage for the yearly [[Olympiad]] held between the camps in which Mohawk carries a 12-0 record.\n\nDuring the first day of competition, Mohawk dominates North Star, cheating in many cases to win. Crockett fails to clear the high jump bar, Hardware gets pummelled in boxing, and Jackie suffers a broken leg in [[field hockey]], thanks to the dirty work of two Mohawk girls. The score at the end of Day One is: Mohawk 170, North Star 63. That evening at the North Star Lodge, Tripper gives a rousing speech, telling the demoralized campers that it doesn't matter whether they win or lose. In unison, Camp North Star begins to chant, \"It just doesn't matter!\" Day Two of the Olympiad belongs to newly inspired North Star as they win every event. Wheels outwrestles his opponent, Spaz defeats Rhino in a stacking contest with inspiration from Jackie and a thwarted Mohawk cheating attempt, and, after 12 years of North Star defeats, Fink finally beats \"The Stomach\" in the hot dog eating contest. North Star now trails by only 10 points with one event left, a four-mile [[cross country running|cross country run]] for 20 points. Tripper steps forward and selects a surprised Rudy to compete against Horse, Mohawk's star runner. The many mornings Rudy spent jogging and training with Tripper pay off as he wins the race, giving North Star its first Olympiad victory by a score of 230\u2013220.\n\nLater that evening, Morty, Tripper, Roxanne, and the CITs sing around a campfire and say their final goodbyes as the camp prepares to close at the end of summer. Rudy has already decided to return to camp next year and Roxanne agrees to live with Tripper. The two ride off on Tripper's motorcycle, leading the buses out of camp and leaving Morty behind, in bed, on a raft in the middle of the lake.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Tripper\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Morty (\"Mickey\")\n* [[Kate Lynch]] as Roxanne\n* [[Russ Banham]] as Crockett\n* [[Kristine DeBell]] as A.L.\n* Sarah Torgov as Candace\n* [[Jack Blum]] as Spaz\n* [[Keith Knight (actor)|Keith Knight]] as Fink\n* Cindy Girling as Wendy\n* Todd Hoffman as Wheels\n* Margot Pinvidic as Jackie\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Hardware (billed as Matt Cravenn)\n* Norma Dell\u2019Agnese as Brenda\n* [[Chris Makepeace]] as Rudy\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Critical response {{anchor|Critics}} ==\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 72% based on 36 reviews.
