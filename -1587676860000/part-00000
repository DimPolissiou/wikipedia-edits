[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.<ref name=\"Ministry of the Environment\">{{Cite book |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/159060 |title=Everyman's rights and the code of conduct on private land |date=December 2015 |publisher=Ministry of the Environmentnd |isbn=9789521144561 |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOne may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species). One may [[Angling|fish with a rod and line]] (only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain restrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can walk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from selling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free.

However, the exact definition remains mostly uncodified and based on the principle of ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (what is not illegal cannot be punished).\n\n==== Norway ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nEveryone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through, uncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old [[consuetudinary]] law called the ''allemannsrett'' (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/doc/Laws/Acts/Outdoor-Recreation-Act.html?id=172932 |title=Outdoor Recreation Act |date=28 June 1957 |publisher=regjeringen.no |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref> It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms ''utmark'' and ''innmark'' divide areas where the right to roam is valid (''utmark'', literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out Field]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (''innmark'', \"land inside [the boundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies ''innmark'' thoroughly,<ref>\"g\u00e5rdsplass, hustomt, dyrket mark, engsl\u00e5tt, kulturbeite og skogplantefelt og liknende omr\u00e5der hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier eller bruker. Udyrkede, mindre grunnstykker som ligger i dyrket mark eller engsl\u00e5tt eller er gjerdet inn sammen med slikt omr\u00e5de, regnes ogs\u00e5 som innmark. Det samme gjelder omr\u00e5der for industrielt eller annen s\u00e6rlig \u00f8yemed hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier, bruker eller andre.\"{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}<!-- This extended quotation should be rendered in english on this en:wp --></ref> and all areas not covered by this definition are defined as ''utmark'', generally speaking uninhabited and uncultivated areas. Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing license. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a license, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. {{Citation needed}}\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

Restrictions apply for [[nature reserve]]s and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon''). The ''hemfridszon's'' size depends on conditions but can be as large as 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house.<ref name=\"NaturBB\" /> To better protect access to water and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not permitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or shoreline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1998:808#K7 |title=Milj\u00f6balk (1998:808) (MB) |publisher=Lagen.nu |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref>\n\nFishing remains essentially private\u2014apart from on the biggest five lakes and the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], [[\u00d6resund|the Sound]], [[Kattegat]] and [[Skagerrak]].

However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref> The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.

[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards).

Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing license. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a license, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. <ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon'').

Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref> The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.

bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal suspects and criminal fugitives to territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some authoritarian countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests.

The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

Protesters demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead despite calls asking for her resignation.

'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal suspects and criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries issued travel warnings to their citizens concerning Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests.

The establishment waited for demonstrators' aggression to increase so they could justify greater militarisation of the police and dismiss the protesters as \"insurgents\" and also their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts formed within the government with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer holds a blue flag warning the protesters to disperse at an unapproved march.]]\nThe reputation of the police took a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October 2019, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, their aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represents hostility and suppression.

Criminals took advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain illegal acts such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency than the same period the year before.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead despite calls asking for her resignation.

'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

Most of the cathedral is below ground, with only the {{convert|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter {{convert|42|m|adj=on|sp=us}} roof of the cathedral, the ovoid roof of the baptistry, and the bell tower visible above ground. The shape of the roof is based in a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution with asymmetric sections. The [[hyperboloid structure]] consists of 16 identical concrete columns assembled on site. These columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing {{convert|90|tonne}}, represent two hands moving upwards to heaven.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The cathedral metr galleryfull.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral with baptistry in the foreground]]\nThe cornerstone was laid on September 15, 1958, and the structure was finished on April 21, 1960, with only the roof structure visible above ground. Once the presidential term of [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] ended, the big push to finish many structures in Brasilia stalled. Although it is likely that Kubitschek intended the cathedral as an \"ecumenical cathedral\" to be paid for by the state and open to all faiths, governments after that did not provide funding, and the building was eventually turned over to the Catholic Church to complete. The cathedral was consecrated on October 12, 1968 (still with no roof), and was officially opened by Cardinal D. Eugenio Salles on May 31, 1970. The ovoid baptistry was dedicated on October 5, 1977, and the cathedral was declared a national historic and artistic monument on July 15, 1990.<ref name=\"timeline\"/><ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://doc.brazilia.jor.br/Centro/Catedral-Brasilia-construcao.shtml\n|title=Catedral de Bras\u00edlia: A longa constru\u00e7\u00e3o\n|work=brazilia.jor.br\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=December 28, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral sees some 1,000,000 visitors each year,<ref name=\"aboutbrasilia\"/>\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of Brasilia, major renovations were begun on April 21, 2012 to update and repair the building and infrastructure, and address issues with the roof. The exterior glazing is being replaced, and the original stained glass designed by Marianne Peretti (which used hand made glass and thus varied widely in thickness) is being replaced by uniform glass cut and assembled in Brazil from plates manufactured in Germany.

Once the presidential term of [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] ended, the big push to finish many structures in Brasilia stalled. Although it is likely that Kubitschek intended the cathedral as an \"ecumenical cathedral\" to be paid for by the state and open to all faiths, governments after that did not provide funding, and the building was eventually turned over to the Catholic Church to complete. The cathedral was consecrated on October 12, 1968 (still with no roof), and was officially opened by Cardinal D. Eugenio Salles on May 31, 1970. The ovoid baptistry was dedicated on October 5, 1977, and the cathedral was declared a national historic and artistic monument on July 15, 1990.<ref name=\"timeline\"/><ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://doc.brazilia.jor.br/Centro/Catedral-Brasilia-construcao.shtml\n|title=Catedral de Bras\u00edlia: A longa constru\u00e7\u00e3o\n|work=brazilia.jor.br\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=December 28, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral sees some 1,000,000 visitors each year,<ref name=\"aboutbrasilia\"/>\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of Brasilia, major renovations were begun on April 21, 2012 to update and repair the building and infrastructure, and address issues with the roof. The exterior glazing is being replaced, and the original stained glass designed by Marianne Peretti (which used hand made glass and thus varied widely in thickness) is being replaced by uniform glass cut and assembled in Brazil from plates manufactured in Germany. In addition to the roof repairs, all marble surfaces will be polished, concrete repaired and painted, the angels in the nave will be cleaned and re-mounted, and the bell mechanisms will be replaced.
