The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]; however, the [[Government of the Republic of China]] continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of [[List of islands of the Republic of China|Taiwan and a number of smaller islands]] compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler|title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|first=Sigrid|last=Winkler|date=June 2012|accessdate=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count.

This is because the UN does not consider them to possess [[sovereignty]], mainly due to the lack of [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] or due to opposition from one of the permanent members.\n\nIn addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to become [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observers at the UN General Assembly]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Secretariat |title=UN GA invitations to non-member states |url=https://undocs.org/en/A/INF/74/3 |website=United Nations |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>, allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings, but not vote.

Father Matteo is a wise and respected person who really manages to understand people's problems, and always appears to be willing to help. Thanks to his charm and positivity, he often helps criminals on their way to redeeming and he always convinces them to confess their crimes and to accept their responsibilities.\n\nComedian [[Nino Frassica]] portrays Marshal Antonio Cecchini, a middle aged [[Carabinieri|Carabiniere]] who also happens to be Matteo's best friend. Cecchini is one of the main co-protagonists and often provides the humor and comic relief in the series. Other notable cast members include [[Flavio Insinna]], who portrayed Captain Flavio Anceschi from 2000 to 2006, [[Milena Miconi]], who played Laura, the mayor of Gubbio as well as Anceschi's love interest and [[Simone Montedoro]] who has been playing the role of Captain Giulio Tommasi, successor to Anceschi, since the sixth season.\n\nFrom season 8, Don Matteo is filmed in [[HDTV]] [[1080i]].\n\n== Syndication ==\nThe series is syndicated in the United States by [[MHz Networks]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Young Montalbano Premieres Exclusively on MHz Next Week |url=http://www.mhznetworks.org/about/press/young-montalbano-premieres-exclusively-mhz-next-week |last=MHz Networks |accessdate=Jan 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot primarily revolves around the titular Matteo, a Catholic priest with an impressive insight in human nature, aiding the [[Carabinieri]], the national as opposed to local police force personnel in solving crimes (usually murder cases). In this he usually finds support in marshal Antonio Cecchini, a warrant officer who often shares with him important details and clues, but also hostility, in the figure of Cecchini's direct superior, captain Flavio Anceschi (and later Giulio Tommasi and Anna Olivieri), who has little tolerance for the priest's continuous interference with the investigation.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Terence Hill]] as Father Matteo Minelli-Bondini: The series' protagonist and a Catholic priest with an impressive insight in human nature, aiding the carabinieri (police) station in solving crimes (usually murder cases).

Father Matteo is a wise and respected person who really manages to understand people's problems, and always appears to be willing to help. Thanks to his charm and positivity, he often helps criminals on their way to redeeming and he always convinces them to confess their crimes and to accept their responsibilities.\n\nComedian [[Nino Frassica]] portrays Marshal Antonio Cecchini, a middle aged [[Carabinieri|Carabiniere]] who also happens to be Matteo's best friend. Cecchini is one of the main co-protagonists and often provides the humor and comic relief in the series. Other notable cast members include [[Flavio Insinna]], who portrayed Captain Flavio Anceschi from 2000 to 2006, [[Milena Miconi]], who played Laura, the mayor of Gubbio as well as Anceschi's love interest and [[Simone Montedoro]] who has been playing the role of Captain Giulio Tommasi, successor to Anceschi, since the sixth season.\n\nFrom season 8, Don Matteo is filmed in [[HDTV]] [[1080i]].\n\n== Syndication ==\nThe series is syndicated in the United States by [[MHz Networks]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Young Montalbano Premieres Exclusively on MHz Next Week |url=http://www.mhznetworks.org/about/press/young-montalbano-premieres-exclusively-mhz-next-week |last=MHz Networks |accessdate=Jan 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot primarily revolves around the titular Matteo, a Catholic priest with an impressive insight in human nature, aiding the [[Carabinieri]], the national as opposed to local police force personnel in solving crimes (usually murder cases). In this he usually finds support in marshal Antonio Cecchini, a warrant officer who often shares with him important details and clues, but also hostility, in the figure of Cecchini's direct superior, captain Flavio Anceschi (and later Giulio Tommasi and Anna Olivieri), who has little tolerance for the priest's continuous interference with the investigation.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Terence Hill]] as Father Matteo Minelli-Bondini: The series' protagonist and a Catholic priest with an impressive insight in human nature, aiding the carabinieri (police) station in solving crimes (usually murder cases).

Two gas-powered [[headlamp]]s provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. Wider axles were available for use in the Southern region of the United States, where a 60-inch tread fit wagon ruts on country roads.<ref>{{cite web |title=Liberty-Brush automobile |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=3 March 2020 |archive-date=3 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903125759/http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html}}</ref> The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a squeeze bulb affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat. \n\nThe engines were a single-cylinder, four-stroke water cooled design, producing 6BHP, with power going to a chain-driven rear axle. The rear-axle disengaged one of the rear wheels while driving around a curve to avoid undue wear and tear on the drivetrain. A feature of engines designed by Brush was that they ran counter-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise. This was Brush's idea intended to make them safer for a right-handed person to crank-start by hand. Prior to the invention of the [[electric starter]], crank-starting a clockwise-running engines frequently resulted in dislocated thumbs and broken forearms if the hand crank kicked back on starting. \n\nAccording to a contemporary review from ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Jouranl'' in 1907, author Hugh Dolnar described the recently introduced Brush as a \"...very, very new and also very, very old, as will be seen from the detailed constrction illistrations below...\" In his critique of the Brush, Dolnar was referencing the decision to use wooden axles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lamond |first1=Robert A |title=The Brush Rounabout - everyman's car, 1907 to 1913 : a tribute to Alanson Partridge Brush, self taught engineer, designer and manufacturer of the Brush Rounabout |isbn=9780646949000 |pages=44 |url=https://brushownersregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Brush-Runabout-Everymans-Car.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Runabout, Brush advertised a $600 \"Package Car\" (also advertised as the \"Delivery Car\") based on the same chassis as the runabout.

[[Runabout (car)|Runabouts]], in general, fell out of vogue quickly, partly due to the lack of protection from the weather.\n\nAfter Brush and the other companies of the USMC folded into [[Maxwell Motor Company]], President [[Walter Flanders]] wrote in 1913 document \"Why We Did Not Use All Our Plants\", the Brush factory in Detroit (along with the [[Flanders (automobile company)|Flanders]] and [[Sampson (automobile)|Sampson]]  Plants) were to remain open and running as factories.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Motor Age |date=January 2, 1913 |volume=Volume 23 |page=54-55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCofAQAAMAAJ&ppis=_c&lpg=RA11-PA54&ots=Ojh37-pidB&dq=Maxwell%20Motor%20Company%20Why%20We%20Did%20Not%20Use%20ALl%20Our%20Plants&pg=RA11-PA54#v=onepage&q=Maxwell%20Motor%20Company%20Why%20We%20Did%20Not%20Use%20ALl%20Our%20Plants&f=false |publisher=Class Journal Company}}</ref> \n<br>\n==Design==\n\n===Brush===\n\nTouted as the \"Everyman's Car\", Brush designed a light car with a wooden chassis (wooden rails and iron cross-members), friction drive transmission and \"underslung\" coil springs in tension instead of compression on both sides of each axle. Two gas-powered [[headlamp]]s provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. Wider axles were available for use in the Southern region of the United States, where a 60-inch tread fit wagon ruts on country roads.<ref>{{cite web |title=Liberty-Brush automobile |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=3 March 2020 |archive-date=3 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903125759/http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html}}</ref> The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a squeeze bulb affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat. \n\nThe engines were a single-cylinder, four-stroke water cooled design, producing 6BHP, with power going to a chain-driven rear axle. The rear-axle disengaged one of the rear wheels while driving around a curve to avoid undue wear and tear on the drivetrain. A feature of engines designed by Brush was that they ran counter-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise. This was Brush's idea intended to make them safer for a right-handed person to crank-start by hand. Prior to the invention of the [[electric starter]], crank-starting a clockwise-running engines frequently resulted in dislocated thumbs and broken forearms if the hand crank kicked back on starting. \n\nAccording to a contemporary review from ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Jouranl'' in 1907, author Hugh Dolnar described the recently introduced Brush as a \"...very, very new and also very, very old, as will be seen from the detailed constrction illistrations below...\" In his critique of the Brush, Dolnar was referencing the decision to use wooden axles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lamond |first1=Robert A |title=The Brush Rounabout - everyman's car, 1907 to 1913 : a tribute to Alanson Partridge Brush, self taught engineer, designer and manufacturer of the Brush Rounabout |isbn=9780646949000 |pages=44 |url=https://brushownersregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Brush-Runabout-Everymans-Car.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Runabout, Brush advertised a $600 \"Package Car\" (also advertised as the \"Delivery Car\") based on the same chassis as the runabout.

Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group.

Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]].

In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]].

Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality, such as the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]], and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]; anarchists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]], and [[Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Saornil]]; and socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campling|first1=Valerie Bryson.

[[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group.

Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman.

Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black & Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world \u2013 such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India \u2013 argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian left|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}\nThe original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=\"Knapp\"/> [[Karl Marx]] asserted that \"[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.

In 1918, \"ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot\" and \"children were deprived of any religious education outside the home\".<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41\u201343.</ref> Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].\n\nHowever, ,religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality, such as the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]], and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]; anarchists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]], and [[Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Saornil]]; and socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campling|first1=Valerie Bryson.

[[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

Its member organisations have a total of more than one million members, which makes up about one fifth of the country's population.\n[[File:Suomen Ammattiliittojen Keskusj\u00e4rjest\u00f6 SAK.jpg|thumb|Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, Hakaniemi, Helsinki]]\n==History==\nThe other two Finnish trade unions confederations are the [[Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees]] (STTK) and the [[Confederation of Unions for Academic Professionals in Finland]] (AKAVA). The most important negotiating partner of SAK is the ''Elinkeinoel\u00e4m\u00e4n keskusliitto/Finlands N\u00e4ringsliv'' (the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]], EK), which represents the majority of Finnish employers.\n\nThe current SAK was founded in 1969 as the [[Finnish Federation of Trade Unions]] (SAK 1930\u20131969), controlled by [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SKDL]] and [[Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders|TPSL]], and the [[Finnish Trade Union Federation (1960)|Finnish Trade Union Federation]] (SAJ 1960\u20131969), controlled by [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]], settled their disputes and merged. The SAK, however, considers itself the continuation of the first Finnish central organisation, the [[Finnish Trade Union Federation]] (SAJ 1907\u20131930).\n\nThe SAK is generally supportive of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], and has spent money on advertisments backing the party.  In 2007, advertisements it placed on behalf of the SDP were found to be defaming, leading the SAK to withdraw them.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/SAK+luopuu+kohutuista+televisiomainoksistaan/1135225569230 SAK luopuu kohutuista televisiomainoksistaan].
