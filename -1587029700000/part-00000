{"title_page": "Atomic spies", "text_new": "[[Image:Klaus Fuchs ID badge.png|right|thumb|[[Klaus Fuchs]], arguably the most important of the identified \"atomic spies\" for his extensive access to high-level scientific data and his ability to make sense of it through his technical training.]]\n\n'''Atomic spies''' or '''atom spies''' were people in the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Canada]] who are known to have [[espionage|illicitly given information]] about [[nuclear weapon]]s production or design to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and the early [[Cold War]]. Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it, are still matters of some scholarly dispute. In some cases, some of the arrested suspects or government witnesses had given strong testimonies or confessions which they recanted later or said was fabricated.  Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. At the same time, numerous nuclear scientists wanted to share the information with the world scientific community, but this proposal was firmly quashed by the United States government. \n\nConfirmation about espionage work came from the [[Venona project]], which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after World War II. These provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available to the government during the 1950s trials, but it was not usable in court as it was highly classified. Additionally, historians have found that records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.\n\n==Importance==\nBefore [[World War II]], the theoretical possibility of [[nuclear fission]] resulted in intense discussion among leading physicists world-wide. Scientists from the [[Soviet Union]] were later recognized for their contributions to the understanding of a nuclear reality, and won several Nobel Prizes. Soviet scientists such as [[Igor Kurchatov]], [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], and [[Cyril Sinelnikov|Kirill Sinelnikov]] helped establish the idea of, and prove the existence of, a splittable atom. Dwarfed by the [[Manhattan Project]] conducted by the US during the war, the significance of the Soviet contributions has been rarely understood or credited outside the field of physics. According to several sources, it was understood on a theoretical level that the atom provided for extremely powerful and novel releases of energy, and could possibly be used in the future for military purposes.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. ''The Russian-A(merican) Bomb: The Role of Espionage in the Soviet Atomic Bomb Project.'' J. Undergrad. Sci. 3: 103\u2013108 (Summer 1996) http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0302/schwartz.pdf</ref><!-- Isn't there another source? --> \n\nIn recorded comments, physicists lamented their inability to achieve any kind of practical application from the discoveries. They thought that creation of an atomic weapon was unattainable. According to a United States Congressional joint committee, although the scientists could conceivably have been first to generate a man-made fission reaction, they lacked the ambition, funding, engineering capability, [[leadership]], and ultimately, the capability to do so. The undertaking would be of an unimaginable scale, and the resources required to engineer for such use as a nuclear bomb, and nuclear power were deemed too great to pursue.<ref name=\"archive.org\">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. ''Soviet Atomic Espionage.'' Chapters 2\u20133 United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1951. https://archive.org/stream/sovietatomicespi1951unit#page/n3/mode/2up</ref>\n\nAt the urging of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leo Szilard]] in their [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|letter of August 2, 1939]], the [[United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]]&nbsp;\u2014 recognized the potential significance of an atomic bomb. They embarked in 1942 upon work to achieve a usable device. Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb, an investment of $2 billion, 86,000 tons of silver{{clarify|date=April 2020}} and 24,000 skilled workers drove the research and development phase of the project.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08</ref>  Those skilled workers included the people to maintain and operate the machinery necessary for research. The largest Western facility had five hundred scientists working on the project, as well as a team of fifty to derive the equations for the cascade of neutrons required to drive the reaction. The fledgling equivalent Soviet program was quite different: The program consisted of fifty scientists, and two mathematicians trying to work out the equations for the particle cascade.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08f</ref>  The research and development of techniques to produce sufficiently enriched uranium and plutonium were beyond the scope and efforts of the Soviet group. The knowledge of techniques and strategies that the Allied programs employed, and which Soviet espionage obtained, may have played a role in the rapid development of the Soviet bomb after the war.\n\nThe research and development of methods suitable for [[dopant|doping]] and separating the highly reactive isotopes needed to create the payload for a nuclear warhead took years, and consumed a vast amount of resources. The United States and Great Britain dedicated their best scientists to this cause and constructed three plants, each with a different isotope-extraction method.<ref>Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage: from Fuchs to the Rosenburgs\" in ''The Haunted Wood,'' (New York: Random House Inc, 1999), 172\u2013222.</ref>  The Allied program decided to use gas-phase extraction to obtain the pure uranium necessary for an atomic detonation.<ref name=\"archive.org\" />  Using this method took large quantities of uranium ore and other rare materials, such as graphite, to successfully purify the U-235 isotope. The quantities required for the development were beyond the scope and purview of the Soviet program.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not have natural uranium-ore mines at the start of the nuclear arms race. A lack of materials made it very difficult for them to conduct novel research or to map out a clear pathway to achieving the fuel they needed. The Soviet scientists became frustrated with the difficulties of producing uranium fuel cheaply, and they found their industrial techniques for refinement lacking. The use of information stolen from the [[Manhattan Project]] eventually rectified the problem.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180\u201385</ref> Without such information, the problems of the Soviet atomic team would have taken many years to correct, affecting the production of a Soviet atomic weapon significantly.\n\nSome historians believe that the Soviet Union achieved its great leaps in its atomic program by the espionage information and technical data that [[Moscow]] succeeded in obtaining from the Manhattan Project. Once the Soviets had learned of the American plans to develop an atomic bomb during the 1940s, Moscow began recruiting agents to get information.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage,\" pp. 190\u2013200</ref>  Moscow sought very specific information from its intelligence cells in America, and demanded updates on the progress of the Allied project. Moscow was also greatly concerned with the procedures being used for U-235 separation, what method of detonation was being used, and what industrial equipment was being used for these techniques.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union needed spies who had security clearance high enough to have access to classified information at the Manhattan Project and who could understand and interpret what they were stealing. Moscow also needed reliable spies who believed in the communist cause and would provide accurate information. [[Theodore Hall]] was a spy who had worked on the development of the plutonium bomb the US dropped in Japan.<ref>Holmes,Marian. \"Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets\". ''Smithsonian Magazine,'' 20 April 2009. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Spies-Who-Spilled-Atomic-Bomb-Secrets.html</ref> Hall provided the specifications of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This information allowed the Soviet scientists a first-hand look at the set up of a successful atomic weapon built by the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe most influential of the atomic spies was [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Fuchs, a German-born British physicist, went to the United States to work on the atomic project and became one of its lead scientists. Fuchs had become a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany | Communist Party]] in 1932 while still a student in Germany. At the onset of the Third Reich in 1933, Fuchs fled to Great Britain. He eventually became one of the lead nuclear physicists in the British program. In 1943 he moved to the United States to collaborate on the Manhattan Project.<ref>Holmes, ''Spies Who Spilled'', 1\u20132</ref> Due to Fuchs's position in the atomic program, he had access to most, if not all, of the material Moscow desired. Fuchs was also able to interpret and understand the information he was stealing, which made him an invaluable resource. Fuchs provided the Soviets with detailed information on the gas-phase separation process. He also provided specifications for the payload, calculations and relationships for setting of the fission reaction, and schematics for labs producing weapons-grade isotopes.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage\", 200\u2013210</ref>  This information helped the smaller under-manned and under-supplied Soviet group move toward the successful detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear program would have eventually been able to develop a nuclear weapon without the aid of espionage. It did not develop a basic understanding of the usefulness of an atomic weapon, the sheer resources required, and the talent until much later.{{When|date=October 2016}} Espionage helped the Soviet scientists identify which methods worked and prevented their wasting valuable resources on techniques which the development of the American bomb had proven ineffective. The speed at which the Soviet nuclear program achieved a working bomb, with so few resources, depended on the amount of information acquired through espionage. During the Cold War trials, the United States emphasized the significance of that espionage.<ref>Joint Committee Chapter 2</ref>\n\n==Notable spies==\n[[File:Greenglass bomb diagram.png|right|thumb|Sketch of an implosion-type [[nuclear weapon design]] made by [[David Greenglass]] as state's evidence, illustrating what he gave the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]] to pass on to the Soviet Union.]]\n\n*[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2014 an American, \"Thanks to Cohen, designers of the Soviet atomic bomb got piles of technical documentation straight from the secret laboratory in Los Alamos,\" the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said.

Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it, are still matters of some scholarly dispute. In some cases, some of the arrested suspects or government witnesses had given strong testimonies or confessions which they recanted later or said was fabricated.  Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. At the same time, numerous nuclear scientists wanted to share the information with the world scientific community, but this proposal was firmly quashed by the United States government. \n\nConfirmation about espionage work came from the [[Venona project]], which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after World War II. These provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available to the government during the 1950s trials, but it was not usable in court as it was highly classified. Additionally, historians have found that records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.\n\n==Importance==\nBefore [[World War II]], the theoretical possibility of [[nuclear fission]] resulted in intense discussion among leading physicists world-wide. Scientists from the [[Soviet Union]] were later recognized for their contributions to the understanding of a nuclear reality, and won several Nobel Prizes. Soviet scientists such as [[Igor Kurchatov]], [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], and [[Cyril Sinelnikov|Kirill Sinelnikov]] helped establish the idea of, and prove the existence of, a splittable atom. Dwarfed by the [[Manhattan Project]] conducted by the US during the war, the significance of the Soviet contributions has been rarely understood or credited outside the field of physics. According to several sources, it was understood on a theoretical level that the atom provided for extremely powerful and novel releases of energy, and could possibly be used in the future for military purposes.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. ''The Russian-A(merican) Bomb: The Role of Espionage in the Soviet Atomic Bomb Project.'' J. Undergrad. Sci. 3: 103\u2013108 (Summer 1996) http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0302/schwartz.pdf</ref><!-- Isn't there another source? --> \n\nIn recorded comments, physicists lamented their inability to achieve any kind of practical application from the discoveries. They thought that creation of an atomic weapon was unattainable. According to a United States Congressional joint committee, although the scientists could conceivably have been first to generate a man-made fission reaction, they lacked the ambition, funding, engineering capability, [[leadership]], and ultimately, the capability to do so. The undertaking would be of an unimaginable scale, and the resources required to engineer for such use as a nuclear bomb, and nuclear power were deemed too great to pursue.<ref name=\"archive.org\">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. ''Soviet Atomic Espionage.'' Chapters 2\u20133 United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1951. https://archive.org/stream/sovietatomicespi1951unit#page/n3/mode/2up</ref>\n\nAt the urging of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leo Szilard]] in their [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|letter of August 2, 1939]], the [[United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]]&nbsp;\u2014 recognized the potential significance of an atomic bomb. They embarked in 1942 upon work to achieve a usable device. Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb, an investment of $2 billion, 86,000 tons of silver{{clarify}} and 24,000 skilled workers drove the research and development phase of the project.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08</ref>  Those skilled workers included the people to maintain and operate the machinery necessary for research. The largest Western facility had five hundred scientists working on the project, as well as a team of fifty to derive the equations for the cascade of neutrons required to drive the reaction. The fledgling equivalent Soviet program was quite different: The program consisted of fifty scientists, and two mathematicians trying to work out the equations for the particle cascade.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08f</ref>  The research and development of techniques to produce sufficiently enriched uranium and plutonium were beyond the scope and efforts of the Soviet group. The knowledge of techniques and strategies that the Allied programs employed, and which Soviet espionage obtained, may have played a role in the rapid development of the Soviet bomb after the war.\n\nThe research and development of methods suitable for [[dopant|doping]] and separating the highly reactive isotopes needed to create the payload for a nuclear warhead took years, and consumed a vast amount of resources. The United States and Great Britain dedicated their best scientists to this cause and constructed three plants, each with a different isotope-extraction method.<ref>Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage: from Fuchs to the Rosenburgs\" in ''The Haunted Wood,'' (New York: Random House Inc, 1999), 172\u2013222.</ref>  The Allied program decided to use gas-phase extraction to obtain the pure uranium necessary for an atomic detonation.<ref name=\"archive.org\" />  Using this method took large quantities of uranium ore and other rare materials, such as graphite, to successfully purify the U-235 isotope. The quantities required for the development were beyond the scope and purview of the Soviet program.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not have natural uranium-ore mines at the start of the nuclear arms race. A lack of materials made it very difficult for them to conduct novel research or to map out a clear pathway to achieving the fuel they needed. The Soviet scientists became frustrated with the difficulties of producing uranium fuel cheaply, and they found their industrial techniques for refinement lacking. The use of information stolen from the [[Manhattan Project]] eventually rectified the problem.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180\u201385</ref> Without such information, the problems of the Soviet atomic team would have taken many years to correct, affecting the production of a Soviet atomic weapon significantly.\n\nSome historians believe that the Soviet Union achieved its great leaps in its atomic program by the espionage information and technical data that [[Moscow]] succeeded in obtaining from the Manhattan Project. Once the Soviets had learned of the American plans to develop an atomic bomb during the 1940s, Moscow began recruiting agents to get information.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage,\" pp. 190\u2013200</ref>  Moscow sought very specific information from its intelligence cells in America, and demanded updates on the progress of the Allied project. Moscow was also greatly concerned with the procedures being used for U-235 separation, what method of detonation was being used, and what industrial equipment was being used for these techniques.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union needed spies who had security clearance high enough to have access to classified information at the Manhattan Project and who could understand and interpret what they were stealing. Moscow also needed reliable spies who believed in the communist cause and would provide accurate information. [[Theodore Hall]] was a spy who had worked on the development of the plutonium bomb the US dropped in Japan.<ref>Holmes,Marian. \"Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets\". ''Smithsonian Magazine,'' 20 April 2009. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Spies-Who-Spilled-Atomic-Bomb-Secrets.html</ref> Hall provided the specifications of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This information allowed the Soviet scientists a first-hand look at the set up of a successful atomic weapon built by the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe most influential of the atomic spies was [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Fuchs, a German-born British physicist, went to the United States to work on the atomic project and became one of its lead scientists. Fuchs had become a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany | Communist Party]] in 1932 while still a student in Germany. At the onset of the Third Reich in 1933, Fuchs fled to Great Britain. He eventually became one of the lead nuclear physicists in the British program. In 1943 he moved to the United States to collaborate on the Manhattan Project.<ref>Holmes, ''Spies Who Spilled'', 1\u20132</ref> Due to Fuchs's position in the atomic program, he had access to most, if not all, of the material Moscow desired. Fuchs was also able to interpret and understand the information he was stealing, which made him an invaluable resource. Fuchs provided the Soviets with detailed information on the gas-phase separation process. He also provided specifications for the payload, calculations and relationships for setting of the fission reaction, and schematics for labs producing weapons-grade isotopes.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage\", 200\u2013210</ref>  This information helped the smaller under-manned and under-supplied Soviet group move toward the successful detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear program would have eventually been able to develop a nuclear weapon without the aid of espionage. It did not develop a basic understanding of the usefulness of an atomic weapon, the sheer resources required, and the talent until much later.{{When|date=October 2016}} Espionage helped the Soviet scientists identify which methods worked and prevented their wasting valuable resources on techniques which the development of the American bomb had proven ineffective. The speed at which the Soviet nuclear program achieved a working bomb, with so few resources, depended on the amount of information acquired through espionage. During the Cold War trials, the United States emphasized the significance of that espionage.<ref>Joint Committee Chapter 2</ref>\n\n==Notable spies==\n[[File:Greenglass bomb diagram.png|right|thumb|Sketch of an implosion-type [[nuclear weapon design]] made by [[David Greenglass]] as state's evidence, illustrating what he gave the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]] to pass on to the Soviet Union.]]\n\n*[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2014 an American, \"Thanks to Cohen, designers of the Soviet atomic bomb got piles of technical documentation straight from the secret laboratory in Los Alamos,\" the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said.
