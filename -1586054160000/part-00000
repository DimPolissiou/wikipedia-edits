Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschel's companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide [[binary star]] system.<ref name=gore/>\n\nWorking at his private observatory in [[Tulse Hill]], [[England]], in 1864 [[William Huggins]] performed the first studies of the spectrum of Aldebaran, where he was able to identify the lines of nine elements, including [[iron]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]]. In 1886, [[Edward Charles Pickering|Edward C. Pickering]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] used a photographic plate to capture fifty [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of Aldebaran. This became part of the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|Draper Catalogue]], published in 1890. By 1887, the photographic technique had improved to the point that it was possible to measure a star's [[radial velocity]] from the amount of [[Doppler shift]] in the spectrum. By this means, the recession velocity of Aldebaran was estimated as {{nowrap|30 miles per second}} (48&nbsp;km/s), using measurements performed at [[Potsdam Observatory]] by [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann C.

It is expected to make its closest approach in about two million years.<ref name=cp48_1_41/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=aaa526_A100>{{cite journal | title=Surface convection and red-giant radius measurements | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=526 | page=A100 |date=February 2011 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201014442 | bibcode=2011A&A...526A.100P | arxiv=1010.3649 | last1=Piau | first1=L | last2=Kervella | first2=P | last3=Dib | first3=S | last4=Hauschildt | first4=P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LASCO\">{{cite web\n  |date=2008\n  |title=LASCO Star Maps (identify objects in the field of view for any day of the year)\n  |publisher=Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO)\n  |author=Star Maps created using XEphem\n  |url=http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p=sky/starmap\n  |accessdate=2012-06-01}} [http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/REPROCESSING/Completed/2012/c3/20120601/20120601_0930_c3_1024.jpg 2012 (with Venus and Mercury)] and [http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/REPROCESSING/Completed/2011/c3/20110601/20110601_0006_c3_1024.jpg 2011]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ohnaka2013\">{{cite journal\n | last1=Ohnaka | first1=K.\n | title=Spatially resolved, high-spectral resolution observation of the K giant Aldebaran in the CO first overtone lines with VLTI/AMBER\n | journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics\n | volume=553 | id=A3 | pages=8 | date=May 2013\n | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321207\n | bibcode=2013A&A...553A...3O\n |arxiv = 1303.4763 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Farr2018\">{{cite journal | bibcode=2018ApJ...865L..20F | title=Aldebaran b's Temperate Past Uncovered in Planet Search Data | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=865 | issue=2 | pages=L20 | last1=Farr | first1=Will M. | last2=Pope | first2=Benjamin J.

It is the brightest [[star]] in Taurus and generally the [[list of brightest stars|fourteenth-brightest star]] in the night sky, though it varies slowly in brightness between magnitude 0.75 and 0.95. Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the mass of [[Jupiter]], named {{nowrap|[[Aldebaran b]]}}.\n\nAldebaran is a red giant, cooler than the sun with a surface temperature of {{val|3,900|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, but its radius is about 44 times [[solar radius|the sun's]], so it is over 400 times as [[solar luminosity|luminous]].

Aldebaran is the red dot to the right, barely visible in the thumbnail.]]\nOn 11 March AD&nbsp;509, a lunar [[occultation]] of Aldebaran was observed in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].<ref name=lynn/> English astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] studied the timing of this event, and in 1718 concluded that Aldebaran must have changed position since that time, moving several minutes of arc further to the north. This, as well as observations of the changing positions of stars [[Sirius]] and [[Arcturus]], led to the discovery of [[proper motion]]. Based on present day observations, the position of Aldebaran has shifted 7\u2032 in the last 2000 years; roughly a quarter the diameter of the [[full moon]].<ref name=halley/><ref name=burnham/>  Due to [[precession of the equinoxes]], 5,000 years ago the [[Vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]] was close to Aldebaran.<ref name=marduk/>\n\nEnglish astronomer [[William Herschel]] discovered a faint companion to Aldebaran in 1782;<ref name=CD/> an 11th magnitude star at an [[angular separation]] of 117[[arc second|\u2033]]. This star was shown to be itself a close [[double star]] by [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham|S. W. Burnham]] in 1888, and he discovered an additional 14th magnitude companion at an angular separation of 31\u2033. Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschel's companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide [[binary star]] system.<ref name=gore/>\n\nWorking at his private observatory in [[Tulse Hill]], [[England]], in 1864 [[William Huggins]] performed the first studies of the spectrum of Aldebaran, where he was able to identify the lines of nine elements, including [[iron]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]]. In 1886, [[Edward Charles Pickering|Edward C. Pickering]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] used a photographic plate to capture fifty [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of Aldebaran. This became part of the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|Draper Catalogue]], published in 1890. By 1887, the photographic technique had improved to the point that it was possible to measure a star's [[radial velocity]] from the amount of [[Doppler shift]] in the spectrum. By this means, the recession velocity of Aldebaran was estimated as {{nowrap|30 miles per second}} (48&nbsp;km/s), using measurements performed at [[Potsdam Observatory]] by [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann C. Vogel]] and his assistant [[Julius Scheiner]].<ref name=clerke/>\n\nAldebaran was observed using an interferometer attached to the [[Hooker Telescope]] at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in 1921 in order to measure its [[angular diameter]], but it was not resolved in these observations.<ref name=pease/>\n\nThe extensive history of observations of Aldebaran led to it being included in the list of 33 stars chosen as benchmarks for the [[Gaia mission]] to calibrate derived stellar parameters.<ref name=sahldoldt/>  It had previously been used to calibrate instruments on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref name=heiter/>\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Aldebaran-Sun comparison-en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Size comparison between Aldebaran and the [[Sun]]]]\n\nAldebaran is listed as the [[stellar classification|spectral standard]] for [[K-type giant|type K5+ III stars]].<ref name=perkins/>  Its spectrum shows that it is a [[giant star]] that has evolved off the [[main sequence]] band of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]] after exhausting the [[hydrogen]] at its core.

After pleading to the lord [[Shiva]] the curse was held at bay and the moon was rejuvenated by shiva's grace for 15 days and desiccated for another 15 days thus waning and waxing to make a lunar month.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}-->\n\n===Names in other languages===\n* In [[Hindu astronomy]] it is identified as the [[Rohini (nakshatra)|lunar mansion Rohini]] (\"the red one\") and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of [[Daksha]] and the wife of the god [[Chandra]] (Moon).\n<!--* In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], it is named Stacidan due to the stars noticeably orange-reddish hue.{{cn|date=April 2018}}-->\n<!--* In [[Persia]] it was known as Tascheter.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->\n<!--* The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''{{lang|la|[[Parilia|Palilicium]]}}''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->\n* In [[Ancient Greek]] it has been called {{lang|el|\u039b\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}} ''Lampadias'', literally \"torch-like ''or'' -bearer\".<ref name=lsj/>\n<!--* In the Middle Ages it was sometimes called Cor Tauri (the Heart of the Bull/Taurus).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->\n* In [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], {{lang|zh|\u7562\u5bbf}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|B\u00ec Xi\u00f9}}), meaning ''[[Net (Chinese constellation)|Net]]'', refers to an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consisting Aldebaran, [[Epsilon Tauri|\u03b5 Tauri]], [[Delta3 Tauri|\u03b4<sup>3</sup> Tauri]], [[Delta1 Tauri|\u03b4<sup>1</sup> Tauri]], [[Gamma Tauri|\u03b3 Tauri]], [[71 Tauri]] and [[Lambda Tauri|\u03bb Tauri]].<ref name=zh/> Consequently, the [[Chinese star names|Chinese name]] for Aldebaran itself is {{lang|zh|\u7562\u5bbf\u4e94}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|B\u00ec Xi\u00f9 w\u01d4}}), \"the Fifth Star of Net\".<ref name=lcsd/>\n\n===In modern culture===\n[[File:Nave Aldebaran.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Italian frigate F590 Aldebaran]]\nThe name Aldebaran or Alpha Tauri has been adopted many times, including\n* [[Aldebaran Rock]]  in Antarctica\n* United States Navy stores ship {{USS|Aldebaran|AF-10}} and Italian frigate [[Italian frigate Aldebaran (F 590)|''Aldebaran'' (F 590)]]\n* proposed micro-satellite launch vehicle  [[Aldebaran (rocket)|Aldebaran]]\n* French company [[Aldebaran Robotics]]\n* fashion brand [[AlphaTauri]]\n* [[Formula 1]] team [[Scuderia AlphaTauri]], previously known as [[Toro Rosso]]\n\nThe star also appears in [[Aldebaran in fiction|works of fiction]] such as ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' and ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''.

This [[substellar object]] would be nearly 12&nbsp;times the [[mass of Jupiter]] and be located roughly at the same orbital distance from Arcturus as the Earth is from the Sun, at 1.1&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.<ref name=Kgiants>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/173002|title=Long-period radial velocity variations in three K giants|author=Hatzes, A.|author2=Cochran, W.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=413|issue = 1|pages=339\u2013348|date=August 1993|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H}}</ref>\n<!--\n{{PlanetboxOrbit begin}}\n{{PlanetboxOrbit hypothetical\n| exoplanet = [[Arcturus b|b]]\n| mass = 11.7\n| period = 233\n| semimajor = 1.1\n| eccentricity = 0.147\n}}\n{{PlanetboxOrbit end}}\nPut the starbox in once a planet has been confirmed, if it is a planet and not a brown dwarf.-->\n\n==Other names==\n\n=== In Arabic ===\nIn [[Arabic]], Arcturus is one of two stars called ''al-sim\u0101k'' \"the uplifted ones\" (the other is [[Spica]]).

Arcturus is the [[zenith]] star of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Using H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled canoes from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer night sky. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade winds]] to landfall. If H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai\u02bbi]]. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use Sirius, the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s ''[[H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba]]'' has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this [[wayfinding]] technique in their non-instrument navigation.\n\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], it was linked to the god [[Enlil]], and also known as Shudun, \"yoke\",<ref name=rogers982/> or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the ''Three Stars Each'' [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and later [[MUL.APIN]] around 1100 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = John H. | date = 1998 | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

This [[substellar object]] would be nearly 12&nbsp;times the [[mass of Jupiter]] and be located roughly at the same orbital distance from Arcturus as the Earth is from the Sun, at 1.1&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.<ref name=Kgiants>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/173002|title=Long-period radial velocity variations in three K giants|author=Hatzes, A.|author2=Cochran, W.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=413|issue = 1|pages=339\u2013348|date=August 1993|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H}}</ref>\n<!--\n{{PlanetboxOrbit begin}}\n{{PlanetboxOrbit hypothetical\n| exoplanet = [[Arcturus b|b]]\n| mass = 11.7\n| period = 233\n| semimajor = 1.1\n| eccentricity = 0.147\n}}\n{{PlanetboxOrbit end}}\nPut the starbox in once a planet has been confirmed, if it is a planet and not a brown dwarf.-->\n\n==Other names==\n\n=== In Arabic ===\nIn [[Arabic]], Arcturus is one of two stars called ''al-sim\u0101k'' \"the uplifted ones\" (the other is [[Spica]]).

In the [[Society Islands]], Arcturus, called ''Ana-tahua-taata-metua-te-tupu-mavae'' (\"a pillar to stand by\"), was one of the ten \"pillars of the sky\", bright stars that represented the ten heavens of the [[Tahiti]]an afterlife.<!--{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=199}}--><ref name=\"makemson\"/> In [[Hawaii]], the pattern of Bo\u00f6tes was called ''Hoku-iwa'', meaning \"stars of the frigatebird\".

Arcturus is the [[zenith]] star of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Using H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled canoes from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer night sky. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade winds]] to landfall. If H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai\u02bbi]]. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use Sirius, the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s ''[[H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba]]'' has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this [[wayfinding]] technique in their non-instrument navigation.\n\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], it was linked to the god [[Enlil]], and also known as Shudun, \"yoke\",<ref name=rogers982/> or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the ''Three Stars Each'' [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and later [[MUL.APIN]] around 1100 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = John H. | date = 1998 | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.
