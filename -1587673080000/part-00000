Penguin has his henchmen Hawkeye and Sparrow distribute free umbrellas to patrons outside the House of Ali Baba Jewelry store and a local bank. The men passing them out call it a promotion, but the owners of the jewelry store and bank know that they were not hired by them. \n\nWhile everyone's inside with the umbrellas, they explode and start spinning and cause a distraction, however even though it was the perfect setup for Hawkeye and Sparrow to commit a robbery, no heist was pulled. When [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] hears of it, he knows Penguin has returned and calls Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in to investigate. Along with Warden Crichton, they view Penguin's [[security camera]] from prison but are able to find out little on his next crime except he has the idea of somehow making Batman help him. Batman and Robin decide to pay a call on [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], who, under the alias K.G. Bird (\"''cagey bird''\") now operates an umbrella store. As soon as they leave, Penguin launches a giant umbrella, featuring a multicolored umbrella (complete with Oswald's hidden transmitter) attached to its handle, from his store's roof.\n\nThe umbrella lands in the middle of the street, and the Duo investigate. While they discover nothing special about it beyond its immense size, they do retrieve the normal-sized umbrella that is hanging from the giant's handle. Convinced it's a clue to Penguin's next crime, Batman and Robin take the umbrella back with them to the [[Batcave]] to further examine it. Unable to discover the significance of the Batbrella, Batman goes in his true identity as [[Bruce Wayne]] inside the umbrella store and, while the Penguin is not looking, he plants a tiny transistor microphone (disguised as a [[spider]]) there so they can find out what he's up to.\n\nUnfortunately, Bruce apparently did not count on the Penguin actually installing a [[burglar alarm]] in his store, and a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] goes off to alert there is a bug being placed in the room. The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow immediately release a net on Bruce and, unaware of his identity but mistaking him for a spy from a rival and competing umbrella store, the Penguin knocks him out with his \"gas-umbrella\". He then has Hawkeye and Sparrow tie him up and toss him into the furnace. Still entangled in the net, Bruce is placed on a conveyor belt that leads to the 10,000 [[degree (temperature)|degree]] furnace.\n\n==Cliffhanger text==\n{{Quote|<poem>OH, THE IRONY OF IT!\nTHE HORROR!\nTHE FLAMING END OF THE CAPED CRUSADER\nCAN BRUCE POSSIBLY ESCAPE??\nFOR BATMAN'S SAKE!
