{"title_page": "Kalam cosmological argument", "text_new": "{{short description|Argument for the existence of God}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}The '''Kal\u0101m cosmological argument''' is a modern formulation of the [[cosmological argument]] for the [[existence of God]]; named for the ''[[kalam]]'' (medieval Islamic scholasticism), it was popularized by  [[William Lane Craig]] in his  ''[[The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument]]'' (1979).\n\nThe argument is similar to the [[unmoved mover]] in [[Aristotelianism]] due to its basis in the nature of causality and argument against the possibility of an infinite regress. However, [[Aristotle]] himself did not believe in a temporally finite universe and his argument is concerned with simultaneously existing causes. The Kal\u0101m argument is named after the Arabic word for \"speech\" ({{lang-ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645}}) because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]] in time, traced the idea to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. The implication of the name is that God spoke (or, to be more precise, willed) the universe into existence.\n \nSince Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and [[Quentin Smith]], and has been used in [[Christian apologetics]].<ref>Graham Smith, \u201cArguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,\u201d Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34\u201361. See also: [[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]</ref> According to [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and [[Richard Swinburne]] are \"among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy\",<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 101</ref> while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, \"there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation\".<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref> \n\nThe Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite and/or the traversing of infinite time, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments (as was mentioned) such as [[Five Ways (Aquinas)|that of Thomas Aquinas]], which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 October 2017 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#TypoCosmArgu |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Form of the argument==\n\nThe most prominent form of the argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, states the Kalam cosmological argument as the following brief [[syllogism]]:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 102</ref>\n#Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\n#The universe began to exist.\n#Therefore, the universe has a cause.\n\nGiven the conclusion, Craig appends a further premise and conclusion based upon a conceptual analysis of the properties of the cause:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 194</ref>\n#The universe has a cause.\n#If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who ''sans (without)'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful.\n#Therefore, an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful.\n\nReferring to the implications of [[Classical Theism]] that follow from this argument, Craig writes:\n\n:\"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ''[[ex nihilo]]'' ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth.\"<ref>[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n{{off topic|date=September 2014}}\nThe Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].<ref>Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.</ref> Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.\n\nIts historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],<ref>[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67\u201375</ref> [[Al-Ghazali]],<ref>al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by \u00ce. A. \u00c7ubuk\u00e7u and H.

His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work \"On First Philosophy\".<ref>Nasr, trans. Seyyed Hossein, An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Albany : State University of New York Press, 1993 pp. 168</ref> He writes:\n\n:\"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.\"<ref name=\"Craig, 1994: 80\">[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 80</ref>\n\nBetween the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).<ref>Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58</ref> It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).\n\nIslamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].<ref>Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986</ref> Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:\n\n:\"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.\"<ref>Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also stated:\n\n:\"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds.\"\n\n==Contemporary influence==\n\nAccording to the atheist philosopher [[Quentin Smith]], \"a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig\u2019s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher\u2019s contemporary formulation of an argument for God\u2019s existence.\"<ref>Quentin Smith, \"Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism\", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183</ref>\n\nThe Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as [[J. L. Mackie]], [[Graham Oppy]], [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], Quentin Smith, physicists [[Paul Davies]], [[Lawrence Krauss]] and [[Victor Stenger]], and authors such as [[Dan Barker]].<ref>[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 4.1</ref>\n\nModern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science ([[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]]), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as:\n:\"... whether there needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether something like the universe can be finite and yet not have a beginning, and the nature of infinities and their connection with reality\".<ref>[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.6</ref>\n\n===Premise one: \"Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\"===\n\nCraig defends the first premise as follows:<ref name=\"Craig, 1994: 92\">[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 92</ref><ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 182-190</ref>\n\n#[[Rationalism#The_intuition/deduction_thesis|Rational intuition]]: He states that the first premise is [[axiom|self-evidently]] true, being based upon the  [[causality|Causal Principle]] that \"something cannot come into being from nothing\", or [[Nothing comes from nothing|\"Ex nihilo nihil fit\"]], originating from [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] philosophy. He affirms that this is a crucial [[first principle]] of science.\n#[[Reductio ad absurdum]]: If false, it would be inexplicable why anything and everything does not randomly appear into existence without a cause.\n#[[Inductive reasoning]] from both common experience and scientific evidence, which constantly verifies and never falsifies the truth of the first premise.\n\nAccording to Reichenbach, \"the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism\", which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.<ref>[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.1</ref>\n\n====Philosophical objections====\n\n[[Graham Oppy]], [[J.

Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to [[David Hume]]'s thesis (''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'') that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world.<ref>[[#Mack|Mackie, 1982]]: 85</ref> This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], who point out the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability.<ref>[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 3.4</ref><ref>G.E.M. Anscombe, '\"Whatever has a beginning of existence must have a cause\": Hume's argument exposed', Analysis XXXIV (1974), 150.</ref> Craig notes:\n\n:\"Hume himself clearly believed in the causal principle. He presupposes throughout the Enquiry that events have causes, and in 1754 he wrote to John Stewart, 'But allow me to tell you that I never asserted so absurd a Proposition as that anything might arise without a cause'\".<ref>[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/professor-mackie-and-the-kalam-cosmological-argument Professor Mackie and the Kalam Cosmological Argument], William Lane Craig</ref><ref>David Hume to John Stewart, February 1754, in The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols., ed. J. T. Grieg (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1932), 1, 187</ref>\n\nMorriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states:\n\n:\"We have no experience of the origin of worlds to tell us that worlds don't come into existence like that. We don't even have experience of the coming into being of anything remotely analogous to the \u201cinitial singularity\u201d that figures in the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.\"<ref>Morriston W (2000). Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause? A Critical Examination of the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Faith and Philosophy, 17:149.</ref>\n\nIn reply, Craig has maintained that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are \"not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist\", remarking:\n\n:\"The history of twentieth century astrophysical cosmology belies Morriston's claim that people have no strong intuitions about the need of a causal explanation of the origin of time and the universe.\"<ref>[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause?: A Rejoinder], William Lane Craig</ref>\n\n====Quantum physics====\n\nA common objection to premise one appeals to the phenomenon of [[quantum indeterminacy]], where, at the subatomic level, the [[causality|causal principle]] appears to break down.<ref>{{cite book |title= Superforce|edition= |last= Davies|first= Paul|year= 1982|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= |page= 94}}</ref> Craig replies that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] of [[Quantum Mechanics]], pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning [[David Bohm]]) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.<ref>Moreland, James Porter, and William Lane. Craig. Philosophical foundations for a Christian worldview. Downers Grove, Ill: InterVarsity P. 469</ref>\n\nPhilosopher Quentin Smith has cited the example of [[virtual particles]], which appear and disappear from observation, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena.<ref>Smith, Q (1988), \"The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe,\" Philosophy of Science 55:39-57.</ref> In his book ''[[A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing]]'', cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how space-time and matter can emerge from 'nothing' (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:\n\n:\"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused. Despite Craig's claim that theories postulating that the universe 'could pop into existence uncaused' are incapable of 'sincere affirmation,' such similar theories are in fact being taken seriously by scientists.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 106.

In a review of Krauss's book, he states:\n\n:\"Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states\u2014no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems\u2014are particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn\u2019t this or that particular arrangement of the fields\u2014what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple ''absence'' of the fields.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0 On the Origin of Everything], David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012</ref>\n\nLikewise, Craig has argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as 'nothing', therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as 'uncaused'. On the topic of virtual particles, he writes:\n\n:\"For virtual particles do not literally come into existence spontaneously out of nothing. Rather the energy locked up in a vacuum fluctuates spontaneously in such a way as to convert into evanescent particles that return almost immediately to the vacuum.\"<ref>\"The Caused Beginning of the Universe: a Response to Quentin Smith.\" British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 44 (1993): 623-639.</ref>\n\nCosmologist Alexander Vilenkin has stated that even \"the absence of space, time and matter\" cannot truly be defined as 'nothing' given that the laws of physics are still present, though it would be \"as close to nothing as you can get\".<ref>[http://now.tufts.edu/articles/beginning-was-beginning In the Beginning Was the Beginning], Tufts Now 2014</ref>\n\n===Premise two: \"The universe began to exist.\"===\n\nCraig justifies premise two using both physical arguments with evidence from cosmology and physics, and metaphysical arguments for the impossibility of [[actual infinities]] in reality.\n\n====Cosmology and physics====\n\nFor physical evidence, Craig appeals to:\n\n#Scientific confirmation against a past-infinite universe in the form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-existence-of-god-and-the-beginning-of-the-universe The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe], William Lane Craig</ref>\n#Scientific evidence that the universe began to exist a finite time ago at the Big Bang.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n#The [[Borde\u2013Guth\u2013Vilenkin theorem]],<ref>A.

We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein\u2019s equations.

This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nAndrew Loke has argued against the metaphysical possibility of a beginningless universe as well as that of an actual infinite existing in the real world.<ref>[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61, 67-68</ref>\n\nAnother criticism comes from Thomist philosopher [https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/yeah-but-is-it-actually-actually.html Dr. Edward Feser] who claims that past and future events are potential rather than actual, meaning that an infinite past could exist in a similar way to how an infinite number of potential halfway points exist between any two given points (as was discussed in one of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]'s paradoxes).\n\n====Traversing an Infinite====\n\nAn alternative way to argue against the past eternity of the universe is through the impossibility of traversing  (counting/crossing/completing) infinity. The argument generally goes something like this:\n\n#If the past were infinitely long, an infinite amount of time would have had to pass before today.\n#An infinite amount of time can never truly pass (because infinite time would never run out).\n#Therefore, the universe cannot be infinitely old.\n#Therefore, the universe began to exist. \n\nThis argument presupposes presentism or the A Theory of time. If A Theory is correct, all past moments would have to occur before the present, which would vindicate the first premise. The second premise follows also from A Theory along with the nature of infinity being endless. Therefore, it follows that the universe cannot be infinitely old and began to exist.\n\n===Conclusion: \"The universe has a cause.\"===\n\nGiven that the Kalam cosmological argument is a [[deductive argument]], if both premises are true, the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily.\n\nIn a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',<ref>[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]</ref> published in 1979, Michael Martin states:\n:\"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref>\nMartin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \"''ex nihilo''\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \"creating\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103\u201314</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.\n#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.\n#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. \n#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. \n#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.\n\nCraig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \"uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.\n\nIn addition to the above arguments, several points can be made which draw further conclusions about the nature of the cause.\n#The Principle of Proportional Causality (PPC), which states that whatever is present in the effect must be somehow present in the cause, would require the patterns and information of the universe to be present within the cause somehow. Since this information cannot exist in a material way (e.g., how a ball possesses a spherical pattern), it must exist in an immaterial way. But for information to exist in an immaterial way is what is classically defined as intellect (e.g. the mental concept of a sphere). Therefore, the cause must possess all information in the universe and is thus all-knowing.\n#If the PPC is not accepted, given that the cause of the universe must be a personal and free agent, the complexity and precision of the universe implies extreme intelligence.\n#In addition to Occam's Razor, it may be argued that the unicity and coherence of the universe implies a single agent behind the creation of the universe.\n\n===Theories of time===\n\nCraig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the \"tensed theory of time\" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the \"tenseless theory of time\" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \"begin to exist\":\n\n:\"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction.

However, [[Aristotle]] himself did not believe in a temporally finite universe and his argument is concerned with simultaneously existing causes. The Kal\u0101m argument is named after the Arabic word for \"speech\" ({{lang-ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645}}) because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]] in time, traced the idea to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. The implication of the name is that God spoke (or, to be more precise, willed) the universe into existence.\n \nSince Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and [[Quentin Smith]], and has been used in [[Christian apologetics]].<ref>Graham Smith, \u201cArguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,\u201d Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34\u201361. See also: [[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]</ref> According to [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and [[Richard Swinburne]] are \"among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy\",<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 101</ref> while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, \"there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation\".<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref> \n\nThe Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite and/or the traversing of infinite time, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments (as was mentioned) such as [[Five Ways (Aquinas)|that of Thomas Aquinas]], which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 October 2017 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#TypoCosmArgu |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Form of the argument==\n\nThe most prominent form of the argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, states the Kalam cosmological argument as the following brief [[syllogism]]:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 102</ref>\n#Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\n#The universe began to exist.\n#Therefore, the universe has a cause.\n\nGiven the conclusion, Craig appends a further premise and conclusion based upon a conceptual analysis of the properties of the cause:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 194</ref>\n#The universe has a cause.\n#If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who ''sans (without)'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful.\n#Therefore, an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful.\n\nReferring to the implications of [[Classical Theism]] that follow from this argument, Craig writes:\n\n:\"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ''[[ex nihilo]]'' ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth.\"<ref>[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n{{off topic|date=September 2014}}\nThe Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].<ref>Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.</ref> Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.\n\nIts historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],<ref>[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67\u201375</ref> [[Al-Ghazali]],<ref>al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by \u00ce. A. \u00c7ubuk\u00e7u and H.

His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work \"On First Philosophy\".<ref>Nasr, trans. Seyyed Hossein, An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Albany : State University of New York Press, 1993 pp. 168</ref> He writes:\n\n:\"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.\"<ref name=\"Craig, 1994: 80\">[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 80</ref>\n\nBetween the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).<ref>Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58</ref> It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).\n\nIslamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].<ref>Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986</ref> Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:\n\n:\"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.\"<ref>Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also stated:\n\n:\"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds.\"\n\n==Contemporary influence==\n\nAccording to the atheist philosopher [[Quentin Smith]], \"a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig\u2019s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher\u2019s contemporary formulation of an argument for God\u2019s existence.\"<ref>Quentin Smith, \"Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism\", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183</ref>\n\nThe Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as [[J.

Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience.

Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:\n\n:\"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused.

In a review of Krauss's book, he states:\n\n:\"Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states\u2014no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems\u2014are particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn\u2019t this or that particular arrangement of the fields\u2014what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple ''absence'' of the fields.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0 On the Origin of Everything], David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012</ref>\n\nLikewise, Craig has argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as 'nothing', therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as 'uncaused'.

This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nAndrew Loke has argued against the metaphysical possibility of a beginningless universe as well as that of an actual infinite existing in the real world.<ref>[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61, 67-68</ref>\n\nAnother criticism comes from Thomist philosopher [https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/yeah-but-is-it-actually-actually.html Dr. Edward Feser] who claims that past and future events are potential rather than actual, meaning that an infinite past could exist in a similar way to how an infinite number of potential halfway points exist between any two given points (as was discussed in one of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]'s paradoxes).\n\n====Traversing an Infinite====\n\nAn alternative way to argue against the past eternity of the universe is through the impossibility of traversing  (counting/crossing/completing) infinity. The argument generally goes something like this:\n\n#If the past were infinitely long, an infinite amount of time would have had to pass before today.\n#An infinite amount of time can never truly pass (because infinite time would never run out).\n#Therefore, the universe cannot be infinitely old.\n#Therefore, the universe began to exist. \n\nThis argument presupposes presentism or the A Theory of time. If A Theory is correct, all past moments would have to occur before the present, which would vindicate the first premise. The second premise follows also from A Theory along with the nature of infinity being endless. Therefore, it follows that the universe cannot be infinitely old and began to exist.\n\n===Conclusion: \"The universe has a cause.\"===\n\nGiven that the Kalam cosmological argument is a [[deductive argument]], if both premises are true, the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily.\n\nIn a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',<ref>[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]</ref> published in 1979, Michael Martin states:\n:\"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref>\nMartin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \"''ex nihilo''\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \"creating\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103\u201314</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.\n#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.\n#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. \n#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. \n#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.\n\nCraig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \"uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.\n\nIn addition to the above arguments, several points can be made which draw further conclusions about the nature of the cause.\n#The Principle of Proportional Causality (PPC), which states that whatever is present in the effect must be somehow present in the cause, would require the patterns and information of the universe to be present within the cause somehow. Since this information cannot exist in a material way (e.g., how a ball possesses a spherical pattern), it must exist in an immaterial way. But for information to exist in an immaterial way is what is classically defined as intellect (e.g. the mental concept of a sphere). Therefore, the cause must possess all information in the universe and is thus all-knowing.\n#If the PPC is not accepted, given that the cause of the universe must be a personal and free agent, the complexity and precision of the universe implies extreme intelligence.\n#In addition to Occam's Razor, it may be argued that the unicity and coherence of the universe implies a single agent behind the creation of the universe.\n\n===Theories of time===\n\nCraig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the \"tensed theory of time\" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the \"tenseless theory of time\" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \"begin to exist\":\n\n:\"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived.\"<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 183\u2013184</ref>\n\nCraig has defended the A-theory against objections from [[J.

A [[sequel]] to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by [[anime]] with most of the animation being done by [[Studio Mir]] of South Korea and some by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] Co. of Japan.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the series is set in a [[fictional universe]] in which some people can manipulate, or \"bend\", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the \"Avatar,\" can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar [[Korra]], the successor of [[Aang]] from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\n\nThe main characters are voiced by [[Janet Varney]], [[Seychelle Gabriel]], [[David Faustino]], [[P. J. Byrne]], [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Mindy Sterling]], and supporting voice actors include [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Lisa Edelstein]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Anne Heche]] and [[Zelda Williams]]. Several people involved in the creation of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (such as designer [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], writer Tim Hedrick and composers [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] and [[Benjamin Wynn]]) returned to work on ''The Legend of Korra''. \n''The Legend of Korra'' ran for 52 episodes, separated into <!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\". See consensus at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra/Archive_2#Book_2_and_season_2 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra#Books_vs._Seasons -->four seasons (\"books\"). The series has been continued as a [[The Legend of Korra (comics)|comics series]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''The Legend of Korra'' received critical acclaim, drawing favorable comparisons with the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It has been praised for its writing and production values. The series has been nominated for and won awards from the [[Annie Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]], and a [[Gracie Award]]. The series was also praised for addressing [[sociopolitical]] issues such as [[social unrest]] and [[terrorism]], as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of The Legend of Korra episodes}}\n''The Legend of Korra'' was initially conceived as a twelve-episode [[miniseries]]. Nickelodeon declined the creators' [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for an ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' follow-up animated movie based on what then became the three-part comics ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Promise|The Promise]], [[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Search|The Search]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Rift|The Rift]]'', choosing instead to expand ''Korra'' to 26 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Avatar: The Search' was pitched as a movie by Mike DiMartino, but Nick opted for 'Korra' Book 2|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=March 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514003635/http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|archivedate=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes.

The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.  The distinguishing element of the series is \"bending\", the ability of some people to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] manipulate the classical element associated with their nation ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], or [[Air (classical element)|air]]). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a result of a [[genocide]] in the series's [[backstory]], there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.\n\nOnly one person, the \"[[Avatar]]\", can bend all four elements. Cyclically [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] among the world's four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. ''The Legend of Korra'' focuses on Avatar [[Korra (The Legend of Korra)|Korra]], a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar [[Aang]] from ''The Last Airbender''.\n\nThe first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of ''The Last Airbender''. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as \"if [[Manhattan]] had happened in Asia\" by the series' creators,<ref name=\"Korra Nation fan questions\">{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|last2=DiMartino|first2=Michael Dante|title=The Legend of Korra: All Answered Questions|url=http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|work=Korra Nation|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150736/http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}} ([http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150624/http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the |date=September 26, 2013 }})</ref> and its residents are united by their passion for \"pro-bending\", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/|title=Politics and Privilege in The Legend of Korra|work=The Artifice|date=July 15, 2013|first=Kevin|last=Wong|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004752/https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/#|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season adds the southern polar region as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe first season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'', sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], Avatar [[Aang]]'s son. She enters the pro-bending league, and befriends the brothers [[Bolin (The Legend of Korra)|Bolin]] and [[Mako (The Legend of Korra)|Mako]], as well as [[Asami Sato]], heiress to Future Industries, a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the \"Equalists\", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong and United Forces General Iroh, unmask Amon as a bloodbender and Tarrlok's brother, ending the Equalists' coup. A spiritual meeting with her predecessor Aang allows Korra to realize her powers and to restore the bending abilities of Amon's victims.\n\nThe second season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'', begins six months later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra turns to her spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, starting a civil war in which he is opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison her opponent, the spirit of darkness, Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. During their fight, Unalaq/Vaatu pulls Raava out of Korra and destroys her, severing Korra's link to the previous Avatars; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq and revives Raava from within Vaatu. Korra then fuses with Raava again but the link to the previous Avatars has been permanently severed. Korra decides to leave the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.\n\nThe third season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'', begins two weeks later with nonbenders all over the world obtaining airbending powers as a result of the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads, the newly airbending criminal [[Zaheer (The Legend of Korra)|Zaheer]] escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic [[secret society]]&nbsp;\u2013 kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is defeated by a giant cyclone led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.\n\nThe final season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 4)|Book Four: Balance]],'' is set three years later. Korra slowly recovers from the injuries incurred in the fight with Zaheer, traveling the world alone and haunted by fear. Meanwhile, Suyin's former head of security, Kuvira, reunites the fractured Earth Kingdom with the metalbenders loyal to her, and refuses to release power to the unpopular heir to the throne, Prince Wu. At the head of her new, totalitarian \"Earth Empire\", Kuvira seizes Suyin's city of Zaofu and sets her sights on the United Republic, which she claims for her nation. With [[Toph Beifong]]'s help, Korra frees herself of the remnants of Zaheer's poison, but after losing a duel to Kuvira at Zaofu, she allows Zaheer to help her overcome her fears and fully reconnect with her [[List of light deities|Avatar Spirit]], Raava. When Kuvira attacks Republic City with a giant [[mecha]] carrying a spirit-powered superweapon, it takes all the efforts of Korra and her friends, including the inventor Varrick and his assistant Zhu Li, to stop the colossus. Only after Korra saves her from the blast wave that Kuvira's weapon discharges when it's destroyed, blowing open a third portal to the Spirit World and destroying much of the city, does she concede defeat. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, and with Korra and Asami leaving together for a vacation in the Spirit World.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=9 | Main cast\n|-\n| [[File:Janet Varney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|Janet Varney]]\n| [[File:David Faustino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|David Faustino]]\n| [[File:P.

The series mostly abstains from using the [[Anime#Attributes|visual tropes]] characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.\n\nAs in ''Avatar'', the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in [[traditional Chinese characters]], without translating it. For example, on the \"Wanted\" posters seen in the episode \"The Stakeout\", the names of the protagonists are written as \u5bc7\u62c9 (Korra), \u99ac\u9ad8 (Mako) and \u613d\u6797 (Bolin).\n\n===Music===\n''The Legend of Korra'' is set to music by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], who previously wrote the music for ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' with [[Benjamin Wynn]]. For ''The Legend of Korra'', Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead [[sound designer]]; the two collaborate with [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] artist Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schick|first=Michal|title=SeptBender Interview: Jeremy Zuckerman discusses music-bending on 'The Legend of Korra'|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/23/the-legend-of-korra-jeremy-zuckerman-track-team-interview/|accessdate=September 23, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=September 23, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111052/http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/23/the-legend-of-korra-jeremy-zuckerman-track-team-interview/|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Konietzko and DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend [[traditional Chinese music]] with [[Jazz#1920s and 1930s|early jazz]].

A [[sequel]] to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by [[anime]] with most of the animation being done by [[Studio Mir]] of South Korea and some by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] Co. of Japan.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the series is set in a [[fictional universe]] in which some people can manipulate, or \"bend\", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the \"Avatar,\" can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar [[Korra]], the successor of [[Aang]] from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\n\nThe main characters are voiced by [[Janet Varney]], [[Seychelle Gabriel]], [[David Faustino]], [[P. J. Byrne]], [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Mindy Sterling]], and supporting voice actors include [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Lisa Edelstein]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Anne Heche]] and [[Zelda Williams]]. Several people involved in the creation of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (such as designer [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], writer Tim Hedrick and composers [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] and [[Benjamin Wynn]]) returned to work on ''The Legend of Korra''. \n''The Legend of Korra'' ran for 52 episodes, separated into <!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\".

The series has been continued as a [[The Legend of Korra (comics)|comics series]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''The Legend of Korra'' received critical acclaim, drawing favorable comparisons with the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It has been praised for its writing and production values. The series has been nominated for and won awards from the [[Annie Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]], and a [[Gracie Award]]. The series was also praised for addressing [[sociopolitical]] issues such as [[social unrest]] and [[terrorism]], as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of The Legend of Korra episodes}}\n''The Legend of Korra'' was initially conceived as a twelve-episode [[miniseries]]. Nickelodeon declined the creators' [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for an ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' follow-up animated movie based on what then became the three-part comics ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Promise|The Promise]], [[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Search|The Search]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Rift|The Rift]]'', choosing instead to expand ''Korra'' to 26 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Avatar: The Search' was pitched as a movie by Mike DiMartino, but Nick opted for 'Korra' Book 2|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=March 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514003635/http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|archivedate=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons (\"Books\") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes (\"Chapters\") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. ''The Legend of Korra'' concluded with the fourth season.<ref name=\"season2\">{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Konietzko|title=I'm Sure This Meme Is Dead By Now But It Still|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716052845/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n<!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\".

The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.  The distinguishing element of the series is \"bending\", the ability of some people to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] manipulate the classical element associated with their nation ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], or [[Air (classical element)|air]]). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a result of a [[genocide]] in the series's [[backstory]], there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.\n\nOnly one person, the \"[[Avatar]]\", can bend all four elements. Cyclically [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] among the world's four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. ''The Legend of Korra'' focuses on Avatar [[Korra (The Legend of Korra)|Korra]], a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar [[Aang]] from ''The Last Airbender''.\n\nThe first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of ''The Last Airbender''. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as \"if [[Manhattan]] had happened in Asia\" by the series' creators,<ref name=\"Korra Nation fan questions\">{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|last2=DiMartino|first2=Michael Dante|title=The Legend of Korra: All Answered Questions|url=http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|work=Korra Nation|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150736/http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}} ([http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150624/http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the |date=September 26, 2013 }})</ref> and its residents are united by their passion for \"pro-bending\", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/|title=Politics and Privilege in The Legend of Korra|work=The Artifice|date=July 15, 2013|first=Kevin|last=Wong|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004752/https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/#|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season adds the southern polar region as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe first season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'', sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], Avatar [[Aang]]'s son. She enters the pro-bending league, and befriends the brothers [[Bolin (The Legend of Korra)|Bolin]] and [[Mako (The Legend of Korra)|Mako]], as well as [[Asami Sato]], heiress to Future Industries, a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the \"Equalists\", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong and United Forces General Iroh, unmask Amon as a bloodbender and Tarrlok's brother, ending the Equalists' coup. A spiritual meeting with her predecessor Aang allows Korra to realize her powers and to restore the bending abilities of Amon's victims.\n\nThe second season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'', begins six months later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra turns to her spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, starting a civil war in which he is opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison her opponent, the spirit of darkness, Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. During their fight, Unalaq/Vaatu pulls Raava out of Korra and destroys her, severing Korra's link to the previous Avatars; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq and revives Raava from within Vaatu. Korra then fuses with Raava again but the link to the previous Avatars has been permanently severed. Korra decides to leave the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.\n\nThe third season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'', begins two weeks later with nonbenders all over the world obtaining airbending powers as a result of the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads, the newly airbending criminal [[Zaheer (The Legend of Korra)|Zaheer]] escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic [[secret society]]&nbsp;\u2013 kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is defeated by a giant cyclone led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.\n\nThe final season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 4)|Book Four: Balance]],'' is set three years later. Korra slowly recovers from the injuries incurred in the fight with Zaheer, traveling the world alone and haunted by fear. Meanwhile, Suyin's former head of security, Kuvira, reunites the fractured Earth Kingdom with the metalbenders loyal to her, and refuses to release power to the unpopular heir to the throne, Prince Wu. At the head of her new, totalitarian \"Earth Empire\", Kuvira seizes Suyin's city of Zaofu and sets her sights on the United Republic, which she claims for her nation. With [[Toph Beifong]]'s help, Korra frees herself of the remnants of Zaheer's poison, but after losing a duel to Kuvira at Zaofu, she allows Zaheer to help her overcome her fears and fully reconnect with her [[List of light deities|Avatar Spirit]], Raava. When Kuvira attacks Republic City with a giant [[mecha]] carrying a spirit-powered superweapon, it takes all the efforts of Korra and her friends, including the inventor Varrick and his assistant Zhu Li, to stop the colossus. Only after Korra saves her from the blast wave that Kuvira's weapon discharges when it's destroyed, blowing open a third portal to the Spirit World and destroying much of the city, does she concede defeat. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, and with Korra and Asami leaving together for a vacation in the Spirit World.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=9 | Main cast\n|-\n| [[File:Janet Varney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|Janet Varney]]\n| [[File:David Faustino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|David Faustino]]\n| [[File:P.

The series mostly abstains from using the [[Anime#Attributes|visual tropes]] characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.\n\nAs in ''Avatar'', the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in [[traditional Chinese characters]], without translating it. For example, on the \"Wanted\" posters seen in the episode \"The Stakeout\", the names of the protagonists are written as \u5bc7\u62c9 (Korra), \u99ac\u9ad8 (Mako) and \u613d\u6797 (Bolin).\n\n===Music===\n''The Legend of Korra'' is set to music by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], who previously wrote the music for ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' with [[Benjamin Wynn]].

These risks may enter Australia after people enter the countries from other places (whether on holiday or any other reason), having developed [[infection]]s through food, water, insect bites, or contact with animals or other people. Often the infection is unknown because it is not obvious, and the infected person is not aware of it themselves, until they become unwell some time later. Some of these diseases may be serious, and biosecurity measures are necessary to ensure that the infection does not spread throughout the population.<ref name=dohbio/>\n\nThe Act lists specific diseases (Listed Human Diseases, or LHDs) which are [[contagious disease|contagious]] and can cause significant harm to human health; {{as of|lc=yes|March 2020}}, these LHDs include:<ref name=dohbio/>\n{{div col}}\n*[[human influenza]] with [[pandemic]] potential\n*[[plague (disease)|plague]] \n*[[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS)\n*[[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS)\n*[[smallpox]] \n*[[viral haemorrhagic fever]]s (VHDs) \n*[[yellow fever]] \n*Human [[coronavirus]] with [[pandemic]] potential{{#tag:ref|Note: The coronavirus group includes SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. |group=Note}} \n{{div col end}}\n\nBiosecurity Officers from the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources must be informed by any aircraft [[captain]] or [[sea captain|ship's master]], should any of their passengers show signs of an infectious disease.<ref name=dohbio/>\n\n===Agriculture===\n====Animals====\nAnimal biosecurity involves protecting Australian livestock industries, [[Australian wildlife|native wildlife]], human health and the environment from exotic or emerging animal pests and diseases.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nAustralia is free of many highly infectious animal diseases, such as [[foot and mouth disease]], highly pathogenic forms of [[avian influenza]] (bird flu), [[African swine fever]] and many others. An outbreak of any of these diseases could significantly impact the productivity of livestock industries, and make it very difficult to trade agricultural products overseas, as well as resulting in significant social and economic costs.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nThe [[2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak]] showed just how disruptive such disease outbreaks can be. Avian influenza was detected on poultry farms in [[New South Wales]], followed by widespread [[cull]]ing, causing widespread disruption to the industry. Strict farm level biosecurity is becoming increasingly the norm.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nEmerging infectious diseases in livestock often originate in wild, native species, and these diseases may also affect human health \u2013 so-called [[zoonotic disease]]s comprised about 70% of all emerging diseases affecting human populations in 2013. These included bird flu, avian influenza, SARS and [[Hendra virus]]. The impacts of these diseases can be extremely severe, hence the need to manage livestock and human health risks in a unified way.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\n====Plants====\n\nPlant pests and diseases can damage plant industries, by reducing yields, lowering the quality of food, increasing production costs, and reducing the viability of sales to international markets. They have enormous potential for damage in the huge expanses of the [[wheat]] industry, as well as in the more intensive high-value production of [[horticulture]], wine, [[cotton]] and sugar industries. Fewer pest and disease problems mean lower production costs. Plant pests and diseases can also cause significant damage to the natural environment.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nAustralia is free of many damaging pests prevalent elsewhere, such as [[citrus greening]], [[varroa mite]] (which has devastated [[honeybee]] productivity in every continent except Australia).<ref name=fitt2013/>\n====Food safety====\n{{main|Food safety in Australia}}\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is also responsible for [[food safety]] in Australia.

These risks may enter Australia after people enter the countries from other places (whether on holiday or any other reason), having developed [[infection]]s through food, water, insect bites, or contact with animals or other people. Often the infection is unknown because it is not obvious, and the infected person is not aware of it themselves, until they become unwell some time later.

An outbreak of any of these diseases could significantly impact the productivity of livestock industries, and make it very difficult to trade agricultural products overseas, as well as resulting in significant social and economic costs.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nThe [[2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak]] showed just how disruptive such disease outbreaks can be. Avian influenza was detected on poultry farms in [[New South Wales]], followed by widespread [[cull]]ing, causing widespread disruption to the industry.

These included bird flu, avian influenza, SARS and [[Hendra virus]]. The impacts of these diseases can be extremely severe, hence the need to manage livestock and human health risks in a unified way.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\n====Plants====\n\nPlant pests and diseases can damage plant industries, by reducing yields, lowering the quality of food, increasing production costs, and reducing the viability of sales to international markets. They have enormous potential for damage in the huge expanses of the [[wheat]] industry, as well as in the more intensive high-value production of [[horticulture]], wine, [[cotton]] and sugar industries. Fewer pest and disease problems mean lower production costs. Plant pests and diseases can also cause significant damage to the natural environment.<ref name=fitt2013/>\n\nAustralia is free of many damaging pests prevalent elsewhere, such as [[citrus greening]], [[varroa mite]] (which has devastated [[honeybee]] productivity in every continent except Australia).<ref name=fitt2013/>\n====Food safety====\n{{main|Food safety in Australia}}\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is also responsible for [[food safety]] in Australia.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

More clever and opportunistic than brave or heroic, Snarf displays a certain \"courage under pressure\" and is usually able to talk or bluff his way through danger. His basic goals are to become rich and famous; however, he would rather steal treasure than directly fight for it. His full name\u2014known only to family and close friends\u2014is Snarfenia D\u00e9 Gottago [Also 'Snarfenja'].\n\n'''Aveeare''' \u2013 Aveeare is a robot from space. Aveeare's ship crashed while surveying Snarf's homeworld. Snarf managed to convince the gullible Aveeare that he (Snarf) was a being of great importance: while Snarf was rummaging through a magical pack of holding (a magical belt pack that can hold as much as a large chest to the point that an average sized humanoid can physically climb into it with some effort), Aveeare was astonished at Snarf's apparent ability to change the natural laws of physics. Aveeare became Snarf's faithful sidekick. The name \"Aveeare\" is a shortened version of his identity code: he introduces himself to Snarf as \"a VR-X9-4-M2 Galactic Probe, Government Issue Robot.\" Snarf thinks Aveeare is actually an armored [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]].\n\n'''Telerie Windyarm''' \u2013 Telerie is a beautiful human woman and professional warrior. She is Snarf's faithful companion and romantic interest. Telerie is far more courageous (in some respects) than Snarf; she also lacks a sense of [[modesty]], which tends to embarrass Snarf. Her surname is derived from her magical sword that can \"split the wind.\" It can also deflect [[Magic (fantasy)|spells]], such as lightning bolts.\n\n'''Prince Raffendorf''' \u2013 Snarf's first traveling companion, Prince Raffendorf is human. However, some time ago he was [[Shape-change#Punitive changes|turned]] into humanoid rat by the evil wizard Suthaze. Raffendorf wears an eye patch over his right eye, and is missing his tail\u2014apparently by injury\u2014He is more polite and has better manners than Snarf. The curse on Prince Raffendorf can only be reversed by Suthaze\u2014not likely to occur, since Raffendorf helped Snarf destroy Suthaze's tower.\n\n'''Suthaze''' \u2013 Suthaze is a bald, bearded, evil wizard. He used to have a \"magic time jumping glass\" \u2013 an hourglass that could transport the user into the future for 72 hours \u2013 with which he would plunder the future for fantastic treasures. According to his apprentice, Geezel, Suthaze was able to transport into the years 1967, 1978, and 1983, which apparently coincide with the \"real world\". On his visit to 1983, Suthaze acquired a motorcycle, a [[Revolver|six-shot revolver]], and [[Hells Angels|stereotypical biker]] attire. Suthaze was a clever and powerful wizard; his tower was guarded by a variety of [[Monster|evil humanoids]] and the dragon Willie (see below). His tower was ultimately destroyed, accidentally, by Snarf and Prince Raffendorf in a conflict with Suthaze outside.\n\n'''Geezel''' \u2013 Geezel is almeer, a humanoid being with a lizard-like face and over-sized ears. Although he was an apprentice for Suthaze, he is not evil: he merely wants to become a powerful wizard, and is willing to make any sacrifice to do so. He is not currently a very powerful wizard. For his role in recovering her stolen [[Magic (fantasy)#Magical objects|wand]], he was granted a [[wish]] by Etheah of the Woodland (see below); he wished that she would fall in love with him and teach him magic, which she did.\n\n'''Willie / Kizarvexius''' \u2013 Kizarvexius is an evil dragon; he has a split personality named \"Willie\" who believes that he is a duck. According to Geezel, the dragon was struck in the head by lightning during a powerful storm, and forgot who or what he was. Suthaze [[curse]]d the dragon into believing that he was a duck. Thus, Suthaze gained a powerful servant that could be easily controlled. In his \"Willie\" personality, the dragon spoke with a pronounced lisp, was afraid of snakes, played in an oversize water bowl, was quite gullible, and was friendly\u2014even good-natured. He quickly became friends with the charming Snarf, and allowed Snarf to loot Suthaze's treasure room. Upon learning that the word \"Dragon\" broke the spell that Suthaze had placed on him, Snarf shouted the word at the dragon when leaving the room. As Snarf intended, upon hearing it, Willie reverted to his true personality as Kizarvexius, an evil, fire-breathing dragon and attacked his captors who were pursuing Snarf and his friends. After being caught in the explosion of Suthaze's tower, he once again considered himself to be a duck. So far, this has been permanent; hearing the word Dragon has not caused him to revert.\n\n'''Etheah of the Woodland''' \u2013 Etheah is a good sorceress who lives in her own forested domain. Her wand of wishes was stolen from her by Suthaze, and she was not powerful enough to fight him in his own lair to win it back. She hired Snarf and Prince Raffendorf to rescue it, in return for one wish each on delivery of the wand. Because of the wish that Geezel made, Etheah is in love with Geezel and is teaching him magic.\n\n'''Leech''' \u2013 The leech is a small, octopus-like creature with a single clawed arm. Originally called a \"Gaggaleech\", it came into Snarf's possession when he bought a Gagglezoomer in the town of 'Keynovia'. ~~ Gagglezoomer- a large, unintelligent lizard that will run at high speeds whenever anything touched the sensitive section of its back. (Hitched to a cart or wagon, Gagglezoomers could be used as fast, if unpredictable, beasts of burden.)~~ It was later revealed that the \"Gaggaleech\" was, in fact, a Darkshade death leech\u2014an extremely venomous type of bloodsucking creature. Because of its heroic service in one instance, the leech was grudgingly given a diamond ring which turned out to grant its wearer a wish. The leech wished for the ability to communicate with every living thing, giving it telepathic ability. While trying unsuccessfully to communicate with Aveeare, it accidentally slipped one of its tentacles into one of Aveeare's dataports and seemed to absorb Aveeare's knowledge of science and technology; the leech fell into a coma, and was last seen tied to the back of a Whazzat Lizard, chased away by the spaceman 'Fred' and his Spaceship/Silver Dragon.\n\n==External links==\n*http://larryelmore.com/snarfquest/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:SnarfQuest}}\n[[Category:Fantasy comics]]\n[[Category:Fantasy parodies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox comic strip\n|title= SnarfQuest\n|image= \n|caption=\n|author= [[Larry Elmore]]\n|website=\n|rss=\n|atom=\n|status=\n|syndicate=\n|publisher= [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]\n|first= 1983\n|last= 1989\n|genre= Humor, Fantasy\n|rating=\n|preceded by=\n|followed by=\n}}\n\n'''''SnarfQuest''''', drawn and written by [[Larry Elmore]], is a fantasy [[comic strip]] with sci-fi and modern elements.

Trews could be trimmed with leather, usually [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]], especially on the inner leg to prevent wear from riding on horseback.\n\n[[Tartan]] trews shared the fate of other items of Highland dress, including proscription under  the [[Dress Act]] of 1746 that banned men and boys from wearing the truis (\"Trowse\") outside of military service. The Dress Act lasted until 1782 when it was repealed under the reign of King [[George III]].\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe tartan truis or trousers date back to 1538 as a style of woven [[tartan]] cloth trousers<ref>The Scottish historical review\n, Volume 4 Edinburgh University Press for the Scottish Historical Review Trust, 1907dinburgh University Press for the Scottish Historical Review Trust, 1907</ref> as a garment preferably used during the Highland winter where the kilt would be impractical in such cold weather.<ref>A Companion to Scottish culture David Diaches Holmes & Meier Publishers, 1982 - History - 441 pages</ref> The word is ''triubhas'' in Scottish Gaelic.

Mark, ''The Gaelic-English Dictionary''</ref>\n\n== Traditional trews ==\n\n[[File:Scottish soldiers in service of Gustavus Adolphus, 1631.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|17th century Scottish mercenary (centre) wearing an early example of trews, or possibly tartan [[Hose (clothing)|hosen]] and [[breeches]].]]\n\nTraditional trews were form-fitting garments, similar to the footed [[hose (clothing)|hose]] of the [[Renaissance]], from which they probably evolved. (However, Tacitus says that in 69 BCE the Roman general Caecina was considered, by his wearing of the foreign trews when meeting with toga-clad Romans, to show indication of a haughty spirit.<ref>Tacitus 2.20</ref>) They could be cut as [[Knee-breeches]] or full length.\n\nThese trews were cut on the [[cross-grain]] (US [[bias (textile)|bias]]), which allowed the fabric to stretch sufficiently to mould to the body, and placed the [[tartan]] \"sett\" on the diagonal.\n\nTraditional trews are actually long hose. These hose came all the way up to the waist and were attached to a linen cloth (NB: These were not trousers). They were fastened at the lower leg, below the knee, by a [[garter (stockings)|garter]] (the precursor to the flashes of the [[Highland Dress]]) as can be seen in the painting by [[David Morier]] of the [[Battle of Culloden]]. It is said in Scottish traditional [[folklore]] that these ''triubhas'' were actually the common garment of the 16th to 18th Centuries in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].<ref name=reid>James MacDonald Reid, ''Notes on Scottish Lore'', 2009</ref> It is also a fascinating note that when travelling, in order to avoid getting the trews wet when crossing streams, the [[G\u00e0idhealtachd|Highlander]] would wear shorter hose, ones that would only reach up to the knee, and wrap his \"bed-garments\" around his waist, a form of the [[Belted plaid|Great Kilt]].<ref name=reid/>\n\n== Modern trews and military trews ==\nModern trews are more like trousers with the fabric cut on the [[straight grain]] but without a side [[seam (sewing)|seam]], and are often high-waisted, usually to be worn with a short [[jacket]], as an alternative to the [[kilt]].\n\nColonel [[Sir John Sinclair]] of Ulbster, proved to his own satisfaction that \"the truis\" was an older dress than kilts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishmilitaryresearch.org.uk/ |title=The Lineage and Uniforms of the Regiments of Scotland - Past and Present |last=McKay |first=James (?) |work=Scottish Military History Website  |accessdate=20 October 2010}}{{Citation needed (lead)|October 2010|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUntil the establishment of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] in 2006, military trews were usually worn by members of the [[Scottish Lowlands|lowland Scottish]] regiments as part of their No 1, [[Mess dress|mess]] and [[full dress uniform]]s.  Members of [[Scottish Highlands|highland Scottish]] regiments were usually authorized to wear [[kilt]]s with these orders of dress. However, all Highland regiments, in more recent times, wore trews with less formal orders of barracks and training dress.  They were also part of the uniform of the composite [[regiment]] known as [[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)]] formed in 1994. The new Royal Regiment of Scotland comprises all the former Scottish infantry line infantry regiments and continues to wear trews in certain limited orders of dress.\n\nHistorically trews were part of the Highland cultural tradition, not Lowland.  As such, when Lowland regiments became the first of the Scottish regiments to be formed in the mid-1660s to late 1680s, the Lowland soldiers wore  standard British military uniform and had no desire to wear tartan items and march to the bagpipes, which they considered to be part of a foreign and savage culture.  From these early beginnings up to 1881, the famous Lowland regiments ([[1st Regiment of Foot|1st]], [[21st Regiment of Foot|21st]], [[25th Regiment of Foot|25th]], [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|26th]], [[70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot|70th]], [[90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers)|90th]], [[94th Regiment of Foot|94th]] and [[99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot|99th]]) wore standard British uniform.\n\nMeanwhile, from 1739 onward, the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] regiments which were raised insisted on the familiarity of their native dress and Great Highland war-pipes, albeit in a modified form to suit a British military identity, as part of their cultural identity. They wore the complex [[belted plaid]] and latterly, to encourage recruits unfamiliar with such garb, they adopted the simpler kilt.  However, trews were increasingly worn as off-duty dress and even campaign dress from the late 18th century. Highland regiments stationed in hot or unhealthy surroundings often took to wearing simple white cotton trousers or tartan trews.  For example, the 91st Highland Regt of Foot wore trews during the [[Walcheren]] campaign of 1809 and more famously, the 93rd Highland Regiment of Foot wore trews and round unfeathered Highland bonnets during the War of 1812 (from 1812 to 1815) against the US, when taking part in the British campaign to capture New Orleans in January 1815 and during the disastrous [[Battle of Chalmette Plain]] itself (lithographs of the battle wrongly depict them wearing kilts).\n\nIn 1822, following King George IV's successful first visit to Scotland, he ordered the resumption of Highland dress and traditions for one de-kilted regiment. The regiment chosen was the most senior of the de-kilted regiments, the 72nd. They adopted the Highland feather bonnet, the Highland version of the red [[coatee]], but in lieu of kilts, they were ordered to wear trews for all duties. The tartan chosen was a new form of red or [[Royal Stewart tartan|Royal Stewart]] called Prince Charles Edward Stuart, reflecting the new romantic fashion for all things [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].\n\nDue to the military use of trews by the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] regiments, the perception of trews as Lowland dress spilled over into civilian wear, so that for many years, trews began to be viewed as Lowland dress, rather than the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] kilt. However, in recent years, a resurgence in Highland history and traditions has seen trews re-enter the Highland wardrobe, whilst interested Lowlanders have now encompassed these traditions within a wider Scottish template.\n\n==Highland dance==\n\n[[File:Trews_07SV_109.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Highland dancer wearing ''trews'']]\n\nToday, the sideways kicking step of Scottish highland dancers performing the [[Seann Triubhas]] dance is said to symbolise the kicking off of the trews or trousers in favour of the kilt. However, D.G. MacLennan writes in ''Traditional Highland and Scottish Dances'' that 'this first step has nothing to do with the idea of kicking off the trews, but...is new to the dance and was composed by myself'.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacLennan|first=DG|title=Highland and Traditional Scottish Dances|year=1952|publisher=T&A Constable|location=Edinburgh|page=27}}</ref> Trews were and can still be worn today for the performance of this dance during the colder months of the year or if preferred.\n\n==Plus-fours and golf attire==\n[[Tartan]] [[plus-fours]] are traditional golfing attire that are based on the traditional trews.  These trousers extend 4&nbsp;inches below the knee and are often worn with [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] knee-socks.  Plus-fours were popularized in the [[United States|USA]] by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] during a 1924 visit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The full-length tartan trousers popular with many golfers are also based on trews, but are cut fuller for more freedom of movement and warmer climates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Formal trousers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kinnaird.net/tartan.htm History of the Tartan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061212133613/http://www.btinternet.com/~james.mckay/disp_020.htm Scottish Military History Society Article]\n* [http://www.gaelagusgall.org/gaelweb/kit.html Gael Agus Gall]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Scottish clothing]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the item of clothing|the musical group|The Trews}}\n\n{{Unbalanced|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Image:Sir John Sinclair.jpeg|right|250px|thumb|''Sir John Sinclair'' by [[Henry Raeburn]], 1794\u201395.

Trews could be trimmed with leather, usually [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]], especially on the inner leg to prevent wear from riding on horseback.\n\n[[Tartan]] trews shared the fate of other items of Highland dress, including proscription under  the [[Dress Act]] of 1746 that banned men and boys from wearing the truis (\"Trowse\") outside of military service. The Dress Act lasted until 1782 when it was repealed under the reign of King [[George III]].\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe tartan truis or trousers date back to 1538 as a style of woven [[tartan]] cloth trousers<ref>The Scottish historical review\n, Volume 4 Edinburgh University Press for the Scottish Historical Review Trust, 1907dinburgh University Press for the Scottish Historical Review Trust, 1907</ref> as a garment preferably used during the Highland winter where the kilt would be impractical in such cold weather.<ref>A Companion to Scottish culture David Diaches Holmes & Meier Publishers, 1982 - History - 441 pages</ref> The word is ''triubhas'' in Scottish Gaelic. ''Truis'' or ''trews'' are anglicised spellings meaning trousers.<ref>Edward Dwelly, ''Faclair G\u00e0idhlig gu Beurla: Illustrated Gaelic to English Dictionary''</ref><ref>Colin B. D. Mark, ''The Gaelic-English Dictionary''</ref>\n\n== Traditional trews ==\n\n[[File:Scottish soldiers in service of Gustavus Adolphus, 1631.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|17th century Scottish mercenary (centre) wearing an early example of trews, or possibly tartan [[hose]]n and [[breeches]].]]\n\nTraditional trews were form-fitting garments, similar to the footed [[hose (clothing)|hose]] of the [[Renaissance]], from which they probably evolved. (However, Tacitus says that in 69 BCE the Roman general Caecina was considered, by his wearing of the foreign trews when meeting with toga-clad Romans, to show indication of a haughty spirit.<ref>Tacitus 2.20</ref>) They could be cut as [[Knee-breeches]] or full length.\n\nThese trews were cut on the [[cross-grain]] (US [[bias (textile)|bias]]), which allowed the fabric to stretch sufficiently to mould to the body, and placed the [[tartan]] \"sett\" on the diagonal.\n\nTraditional trews are actually long hose. These hose came all the way up to the waist and were attached to a linen cloth (NB: These were not trousers). They were fastened at the lower leg, below the knee, by a [[garter (stockings)|garter]] (the precursor to the flashes of the [[Highland Dress]]) as can be seen in the painting by [[David Morier]] of the [[Battle of Culloden]]. It is said in Scottish traditional [[folklore]] that these ''triubhas'' were actually the common garment of the 16th to 18th Centuries in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].<ref name=reid>James MacDonald Reid, ''Notes on Scottish Lore'', 2009</ref> It is also a fascinating note that when travelling, in order to avoid getting the trews wet when crossing streams, the [[G\u00e0idhealtachd|Highlander]] would wear shorter hose, ones that would only reach up to the knee, and wrap his \"bed-garments\" around his waist, a form of the [[Belted plaid|Great Kilt]].<ref name=reid/>\n\n== Modern trews and military trews ==\nModern trews are more like trousers with the fabric cut on the [[straight grain]] but without a side [[seam (sewing)|seam]], and are often high-waisted, usually to be worn with a short [[jacket]], as an alternative to the [[kilt]].\n\nColonel [[Sir John Sinclair]] of Ulbster, proved to his own satisfaction that \"the truis\" was an older dress than kilts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishmilitaryresearch.org.uk/ |title=The Lineage and Uniforms of the Regiments of Scotland - Past and Present |last=McKay |first=James (?) |work=Scottish Military History Website  |accessdate=20 October 2010}}{{Citation needed (lead)|October 2010|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUntil the establishment of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] in 2006, military trews were usually worn by members of the [[Scottish Lowlands|lowland Scottish]] regiments as part of their No 1, [[Mess dress|mess]] and [[full dress uniform]]s.  Members of [[Scottish Highlands|highland Scottish]] regiments were usually authorized to wear [[kilt]]s with these orders of dress. However, all Highland regiments, in more recent times, wore trews with less formal orders of barracks and training dress.  They were also part of the uniform of the composite [[regiment]] known as [[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)]] formed in 1994. The new Royal Regiment of Scotland comprises all the former Scottish infantry line infantry regiments and continues to wear trews in certain limited orders of dress.\n\nHistorically trews were part of the Highland cultural tradition, not Lowland.  As such, when Lowland regiments became the first of the Scottish regiments to be formed in the mid-1660s to late 1680s, the Lowland soldiers wore  standard British military uniform and had no desire to wear tartan items and march to the bagpipes, which they considered to be part of a foreign and savage culture.  From these early beginnings up to 1881, the famous Lowland regiments ([[1st Regiment of Foot|1st]], [[21st Regiment of Foot|21st]], [[25th Regiment of Foot|25th]], [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|26th]], [[70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot|70th]], [[90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers)|90th]], [[94th Regiment of Foot|94th]] and [[99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot|99th]]) wore standard British uniform.\n\nMeanwhile, from 1739 onward, the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] regiments which were raised insisted on the familiarity of their native dress and Great Highland war-pipes, albeit in a modified form to suit a British military identity, as part of their cultural identity. They wore the complex [[belted plaid]] and latterly, to encourage recruits unfamiliar with such garb, they adopted the simpler kilt.  However, trews were increasingly worn as off-duty dress and even campaign dress from the late 18th century. Highland regiments stationed in hot or unhealthy surroundings often took to wearing simple white cotton trousers or tartan trews.  For example, the 91st Highland Regt of Foot wore trews during the [[Walcheren]] campaign of 1809 and more famously, the 93rd Highland Regiment of Foot wore trews and round unfeathered Highland bonnets during the War of 1812 (from 1812 to 1815) against the US, when taking part in the British campaign to capture New Orleans in January 1815 and during the disastrous [[Battle of Chalmette Plain]] itself (lithographs of the battle wrongly depict them wearing kilts).\n\nIn 1822, following King George IV's successful first visit to Scotland, he ordered the resumption of Highland dress and traditions for one de-kilted regiment. The regiment chosen was the most senior of the de-kilted regiments, the 72nd. They adopted the Highland feather bonnet, the Highland version of the red [[coatee]], but in lieu of kilts, they were ordered to wear trews for all duties. The tartan chosen was a new form of red or [[Royal Stewart tartan|Royal Stewart]] called Prince Charles Edward Stuart, reflecting the new romantic fashion for all things [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].\n\nDue to the military use of trews by the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] regiments, the perception of trews as Lowland dress spilled over into civilian wear, so that for many years, trews began to be viewed as Lowland dress, rather than the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] kilt. However, in recent years, a resurgence in Highland history and traditions has seen trews re-enter the Highland wardrobe, whilst interested Lowlanders have now encompassed these traditions within a wider Scottish template.\n\n==Highland dance==\n\n[[File:Trews_07SV_109.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Highland dancer wearing ''trews'']]\n\nToday, the sideways kicking step of Scottish highland dancers performing the [[Seann Triubhas]] dance is said to symbolise the kicking off of the trews or trousers in favour of the kilt. However, D.G. MacLennan writes in ''Traditional Highland and Scottish Dances'' that 'this first step has nothing to do with the idea of kicking off the trews, but...is new to the dance and was composed by myself'.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacLennan|first=DG|title=Highland and Traditional Scottish Dances|year=1952|publisher=T&A Constable|location=Edinburgh|page=27}}</ref> Trews were and can still be worn today for the performance of this dance during the colder months of the year or if preferred.\n\n==Plus-fours and golf attire==\n[[Tartan]] [[plus-fours]] are traditional golfing attire that are based on the traditional trews.  These trousers extend 4&nbsp;inches below the knee and are often worn with [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] knee-socks.  Plus-fours were popularized in the [[United States|USA]] by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] during a 1924 visit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The full-length tartan trousers popular with many golfers are also based on trews, but are cut fuller for more freedom of movement and warmer climates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Formal trousers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kinnaird.net/tartan.htm History of the Tartan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061212133613/http://www.btinternet.com/~james.mckay/disp_020.htm Scottish Military History Society Article]\n* [http://www.gaelagusgall.org/gaelweb/kit.html Gael Agus Gall]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Scottish clothing]]\n", "name_user": "Ketiltrout", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trews"}
