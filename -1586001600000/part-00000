A device that is designed specifically for reading e-books is called an \"e-reader\", \"ebook device\", or \"eReader\".\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Readies'' (1930)===\nSome trace the concept of an e-reader, a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen, to a 1930 manifesto by [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], written after watching his first \"[[talkie]]\" (movie with sound). He titled it ''The Readies'', playing off the idea of the \"talkie\".<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | title = The Readies | first = Bob | last = Brown | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129174227/https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | archivedate = 2016-11-29 | isbn = 9780892630226 | year = 2009 }}.</ref> In his book, Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the \"talkies\" and, as a result, reading should find a new medium:\n{{quote|A simple reading machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred-thousand-word novels in 10 minutes if I want to, and I want to.}}\n\nBrown's notion, however, was much more focused on reforming [[orthography]] and vocabulary, than on medium (\"It is time to pull out the stopper\" and begin \"a bloody revolution of the word.\"): introducing huge numbers of [[portmanteau]] symbols to replace normal words, and punctuation to simulate action  or movement; so it is not clear whether this fits into the history of \"e-books\" or not. Later e-readers never followed a model at all like Brown's; however, he correctly predicted the miniaturization and portability of e-readers. In an article, Jennifer Schuessler writes, \"The machine, Brown argued, would allow readers to adjust the type size, avoid paper cuts and save trees, all while hastening the day when words could be 'recorded directly on the palpitating ether.'\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | work= The New York Times | first= Jennifer | last= Schuessler | title= The Godfather of the E-Reader | date= 2010-04-11 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170625093040/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | archivedate= 2017-06-25 }}</ref> Brown believed that the e-reader (and his notions for changing text itself) would bring a completely new life to reading.

Different e-reader devices followed different formats, most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats, thereby fragmenting the e-book market even more. Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e-books.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeanwhile, scholars formed the [[Text Encoding Initiative]], which developed consensus guidelines for encoding books and other materials of scholarly interest for a variety of analytic uses as well as reading, and countless literary and other works have been developed using the TEI approach.

Several scholars from the TEI were closely involved in the early development of Open eBook [http://xml.coverpages.org/openEbook.html]. Focused on portability, Open eBook as defined required subsets of [[XHTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]; a set of multimedia formats (others could be used, but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats), and an [[XML]] schema for a \"manifest\", to list the components of a given e-book, identify a table of contents, cover art, and so on.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This format led to the open format [[EPUB]].

A device that is designed specifically for reading e-books is called an \"e-reader\", \"ebook device\", or \"eReader\".\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Readies'' (1930)===\nSome trace the concept of an e-reader, a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen, to a 1930 manifesto by [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], written after watching his first \"[[talkie]]\" (movie with sound). He titled it ''The Readies'', playing off the idea of the \"talkie\".<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | title = The Readies | first = Bob | last = Brown | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129174227/https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | archivedate = 2016-11-29 | isbn = 9780892630226 | year = 2009 }}.</ref> In his book, Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the \"talkies\" and, as a result, reading should find a new medium:\n{{quote|A simple reading machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred-thousand-word novels in 10 minutes if I want to, and I want to.}}\n\nBrown's notion, however, was much more focused on reforming [[orthography]] and vocabulary, than on medium (\"It is time to pull out the stopper\" and begin \"a bloody revolution of the word.\"): introducing huge numbers of [[portmanteau]] symbols to replace normal words, and punctuation to simulate action  or movement; so it is not clear whether this fits into the history of \"e-books\" or not. Later e-readers never followed a model at all like Brown's; however, he correctly predicted the miniaturization and portability of e-readers. In an article, Jennifer Schuessler writes, \"The machine, Brown argued, would allow readers to adjust the type size, avoid paper cuts and save trees, all while hastening the day when words could be 'recorded directly on the palpitating ether.'\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | work= The New York Times | first= Jennifer | last= Schuessler | title= The Godfather of the E-Reader | date= 2010-04-11 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170625093040/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | archivedate= 2017-06-25 }}</ref> Brown believed that the e-reader (and his notions for changing text itself) would bring a completely new life to reading.

Different e-reader devices followed different formats, most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats, thereby fragmenting the e-book market even more. Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e-books.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeanwhile, scholars formed the [[Text Encoding Initiative]], which developed consensus guidelines for encoding books and other materials of scholarly interest for a variety of analytic uses as well as reading, and countless literary and other works have been developed using the TEI approach. In the late 1990s, a consortium formed to develop the [[Open eBook]] format as a way for authors and publishers to provide a single source-document which many book-reading software and hardware platforms could handle. Several scholars from the TEI were closely involved in the early development of Open eBook [http://xml.coverpages.org/openEbook.html]. Focused on portability, Open eBook as defined required subsets of [[XHTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]; a set of multimedia formats (others could be used, but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats), and an [[XML]] schema for a \"manifest\", to list the components of a given e-book, identify a table of contents, cover art, and so on.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This format led to the open format [[EPUB]].
