The M\u00e9gane has been offered in three and five door [[hatchback]], [[Saloon (car)|saloon]], [[coup\u00e9]], [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and [[estate car|estate]] bodystyles at various points in its lifetime, and having been through three generations is now in its fourth incarnation.\n\nThe first generation was largely based on its predecessor, the 19, and utilized modified versions of that car's drivetrain and chassis.\n\nIn November 1996, the [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic|M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic]] [[compact MPV]] was introduced, using the same mechanical components as the hatchback M\u00e9gane. For 2002, the M\u00e9gane entered its second generation with a substantial redesign taking place, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]] for 2003, whilst also becoming the first car in its class to receive a five star [[EuroNCAP]] rating.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane entered its third generation in 2008, with another totally different design being used; the saloon version of the M\u00e9gane became known as the [[Renault Fluence]] for this generation, and it was introduced in 2009. A fourth generation M\u00e9gane was launched in 2015, with sales commencing in 2016.\n\n==M\u00e9gane I (1995\u20132002)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = M\u00e9gane I\n| image = Renault Megane front 20080104.jpg\n| aka = Renault M\u00e9gane Classic <small>(Saloon)</small>\n| production = July 1995\u20132002<br />1999\u20132009 (Colombia)<br />1996\u20132009 (Argentina)\n| assembly = {{ubl |Turkey: [[Bursa]] ([[Oyak-Renault]]) |Colombia: [[Envigado]] ([[Sofasa]]) |Argentina: [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|Santa Isabel, Argentina]] ([[Renault Argentina]]) |France: [[Douai]] |Spain: [[Palencia]] ([[Renault Espa\u00f1a|Renault Spain]]) |Indonesia: [[Jakarta]] ([[Auto Euro Indonesia|Auto Euro]]) |Belgium: [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]]-[[Vilvoorde]] ([[Vilvoorde Renault Factory|RIB]])}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door [[hatchback]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />5-door [[Station wagon|estate]]\n| related = [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic]]<br />[[Renault 19]]\n| engine = 1.4 L ''[[Renault Energy engine#ExJ|E7J]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.4 L ''[[Renault K-Type engine#KxJ petrol engine|K4J]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.6 L ''[[Renault K-Type engine#KxM petrol engine|K7M]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Renault F3R|F3R]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Renault F-Type engine#F5x|F5R]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Renault F-Type engine#F7x|F7R]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.9 L ''[[Renault F-Type engine#F9x|F9Q]]'' [[diesel engine|D]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.9 L ''[[Renault F-Type engine#F9x|F9Q]]'' [[Turbo-diesel|dT/dTi]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.9 L ''[[Renault F-Type engine#F9x|F9Q]]'' [[Common rail|dCi]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = Hatchback, Sedan & Wagon: {{convert|2580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Coup\u00e9 & Convertible: {{convert|2468|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = Hatchback: {{convert|4129|-|4164|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|4436|-|4400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Wagon: {{convert|4437|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Coup\u00e9: {{convert|3931|-|3967|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Convertible: {{convert|4081|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1698|-|1699|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1365|\u2013|1420|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| designer = Michel Jardin (1991)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autodesignmagazine.com/en/1995/12/renault-megane-project-megane-global-design/|title=Renault Megane - Project Megane global design - Auto&Design|author=|date=20 December 1995|website=autodesignmagazine.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref><br />[[Patrick Le Qu\u00e9ment]] (1991, 1992)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/megane-bravo-compte-a-rebours-pour-un-double-lancement_1349366.html|title= Megane, Bravo Compte A Rebours Pour Un Double Lancement |date=18 September 1995}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:DTW LITC 004 PAR88.jpg|thumb|left|M\u00e9gane Concept Car, 1988]]\n[[File:Renault M\u00e9gane I Phase I F\u00fcnft\u00fcrer Heck.JPG|thumb|left|Pre facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door]]\n[[File:Renault M\u00e9gane Classic Century Heck.JPG|thumb|left|Pre facelift Renault M\u00e9gane sedan]]\n[[File:Renault M\u00e9gane 1gen inside 20120206.jpg|thumb|left|Pre facelift interior]]\n\nDevelopment of the X64 began at the beginning of 1990, with the first sketches of X64 programme being drawn during the first six months of 1990. Very quickly, several themes were outlined and developed into four small scale (1/5) models by September 1990.\nThe name M\u00e9gane was first used by Renault for a concept car shown at the 1988 Paris Motor Show.\n\nThe designs retained were developed around four themes. Theme A: a six light version, evoking the Laguna; Theme B: a model with a markedly cuneiform line; Theme C: another design with ellipse shaped glasswork and rear notch; Theme D: a model with the same elliptical glazing and rounded rear.\n\nIn March 1991, all four styling proposals were developed into full scale (1:1). Theme C by Michel Jardin was chosen by Le Quement and frozen for production in April 1992. The first prototypes were built and presented to management in December 1992. Approximately 432 prototypes were built (at Rueil assembly) and destroyed during development.\n\nIn June 1993, Renault purchased production tooling for the X64, with the first test unit being assembled at the Douai plant in October 1994, and pre production units being constructed from December 1994 to the middle of 1995.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane I was unveiled in September 1995, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]], as a replacement for the [[Renault 19]]. The car was essentially a reskin of its predecessor, and carried over the 19's floorpan, engines, transmissions and chassis design, albeit with much modification.\n\nTaking its name from a Renault concept car shown in 1988, the M\u00e9gane further developed the new corporate styling theme introduced by Patrick Le Qu\u00e9ment on the [[Renault Laguna|Laguna]], most notably the \"bird beak\" front grille \u2013 a styling cue borrowed from the [[Renault 16]] of the 1960s.\n\nAs with the 19 and the [[Renault 9/11|11]] before it, the M\u00e9gane was produced at Renault's [[Douai]] plant in northern France starting in July 1995, and at the Spanish plant of [[Palencia]]. Market launch began on 15 November 1995 in France, and 15 December 1995 for the coup\u00e9. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 1996.\n\nSafety was a key focus of the M\u00e9gane I, Renault's first car reflecting their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar mounted three point seatbelt for the middle rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} safety structure \u2013 a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995.\n\nSome features, such as the three point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the M\u00e9gane).\n\nThe car also benefited from Renault's first \"System for Restraint and Protection\" (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, load limiter and airbag. The M\u00e9gane I achieved a best in class four star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by [[Euro NCAP]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Renault Megane (1998) |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/ratings-rewards/latest-safety-ratings/en/results/renault/megane/18372 |title=Renault Megane (1998) |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nNovember 1996 saw the introduction of the [[Renault M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic|M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic]] [[compact MPV]].\n\nPower came from the Renault E type (\"Energy\") engine in 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L, and the F-type unit in both 1.9&nbsp;L diesel and 2.0&nbsp;L petrol forms, although this time around there was a wider variety of 16 valve derivatives. A 1.9&nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharged]] forms was also available.\n\nRenault also produced a limited number of Renaultsport edition Phase 1's with the Renaultsport bodywork; however, these were very rare. The Renaultsport kit was available to purchase for a short time direct from Renault France, but has now been discontinued, thus their value has increased.\n\nThe [[station wagon|estate]] version of the original M\u00e9gane was only available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] form, with no [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] variants being built, this could be due to the greater popularity of the Scenic in those markets. It was added with the facelift of 1999.\n\nIn Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], but in 1999 Renault acquired a stake in Japanese automaker [[Nissan]]. As a result of Renault's purchase, Yanase canceled its licensing contract for all Renault models sold in Japan, including, but not limited to, the M\u00e9gane I, in 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee for Renault cars.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Facelift===\nA mild facelift in spring 1999 gave the M\u00e9gane I a modified grille, more advanced safety features and upgraded equipment, and [[multi-valve|16 valve]] engines were used across the range. An Estate body style was also launched in mainland Europe with the facelift. The production continued for the Latin America Market, where it was sold alongside the M\u00e9gane II line at a considerably lower price until 2011.\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:2002 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.6 Front.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:2001 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.4.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:Renault Megane Coupe 1.6 16v 2000 (15037225005).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane coup\u00e9\nFile:Renault Megane Cupe (1).jpg|Renault M\u00e9gane Coup\u00e9 (Restyling)\nFile:2003 Renault M\u00e9gane (X64) Privilege convertible (20889553963).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane convertible\nFile:Renault M\u00e9gane I Phase II Grandtour 1.4 16V Fairway Heck.JPG|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane estate\n</gallery>\n\n===South America===\nIn countries such as Argentina and Colombia the M\u00e9gane I was available until 2010 sold as a sedan and an Estate, but in Venezuela was available only as a sedan. It features as the top line of the model the LA04 engine (16 valves, 1.6 litres and 110 HP), and was produced by both Renault Colombia and Renault Argentina, in where it was one of the best selling cars to date.\n\nIt is a car with more advanced safety features, upgraded equipment and more. The M\u00e9gane I had a lower price than the M\u00e9gane II.\n\nIn Venezuela, it was only available in one version: Unique, with a five speed manual gearbox or a four speed automatic one. Both of these were equipped with Abs and other extra equipment including driver and passenger front airbags, foglights, leather seats, electric mirrors and electric windows. In Argentina, not every version had features such as electric windows, electric mirrors or airbags.\n\n===Engines===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"\n!

This was the [[Clio Williams Maxi]], which was the first car truly developed for the F2 Kit Car category, and first appeared in 1996. However, rivals such as [[Citro\u00ebn]] and [[Peugeot]] soon introduced bigger and more powerful cars, which resulted in Renault producing an F2 version of the M\u00e9gane in 1996.

For 2002, the M\u00e9gane entered its second generation with a substantial redesign taking place, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]] for 2003, whilst also becoming the first car in its class to receive a five star [[EuroNCAP]] rating.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane entered its third generation in 2008, with another totally different design being used; the saloon version of the M\u00e9gane became known as the [[Renault Fluence]] for this generation, and it was introduced in 2009.

Very quickly, several themes were outlined and developed into four small scale (1/5) models by September 1990.\n\nThe designs retained were developed around four themes. Theme A: a six light version, evoking the Laguna; Theme B: a model with a markedly cuneiform line; Theme C: another design with ellipse shaped glasswork and rear notch; Theme D: a model with the same elliptical glazing and rounded rear.\n\nIn March 1991, all four styling proposals were developed into full scale (1:1). Theme C by Michel Jardin was chosen by Le Quement and frozen for production in April 1992. The first prototypes were built and presented to management in December 1992. Approximately 432 prototypes were built (at Rueil assembly) and destroyed during development.\n\nIn June 1993, Renault purchased production tooling for the X64, with the first test unit being assembled at the Douai plant in October 1994, and pre production units being constructed from December 1994 to the middle of 1995.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane I was unveiled in September 1995, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]], as a replacement for the [[Renault 19]]. The car was essentially a reskin of its predecessor, and carried over the 19's floorpan, engines, transmissions and chassis design, albeit with much modification.\n\nTaking its name from a Renault concept car shown in 1988, the M\u00e9gane further developed the new corporate styling theme introduced by Patrick Le Qu\u00e9ment on the [[Renault Laguna|Laguna]], most notably the \"bird beak\" front grille \u2013 a styling cue borrowed from the [[Renault 16]] of the 1960s.\n\nAs with the 19 and the [[Renault 9/11|11]] before it, the M\u00e9gane was produced at Renault's [[Douai]] plant in northern France starting in July 1995, and at the Spanish plant of [[Palencia]]. Market launch began on 15 November 1995 in France, and 15 December 1995 for the coup\u00e9. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 1996.\n\nSafety was a key focus of the M\u00e9gane I, Renault's first car reflecting their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar mounted three point seatbelt for the middle rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} safety structure \u2013 a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995.\n\nSome features, such as the three point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the M\u00e9gane).\n\nThe car also benefited from Renault's first \"System for Restraint and Protection\" (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, load limiter and airbag. The M\u00e9gane I achieved a best in class four star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by [[Euro NCAP]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Renault Megane (1998) |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/ratings-rewards/latest-safety-ratings/en/results/renault/megane/18372 |title=Renault Megane (1998) |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nNovember 1996 saw the introduction of the [[Renault M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic|M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic]] [[compact MPV]].\n\nPower came from the Renault E type (\"Energy\") engine in 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L, and the F-type unit in both 1.9&nbsp;L diesel and 2.0&nbsp;L petrol forms, although this time around there was a wider variety of 16 valve derivatives. A 1.9&nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharged]] forms was also available.\n\nRenault also produced a limited number of Renaultsport edition Phase 1's with the Renaultsport bodywork; however, these were very rare. The Renaultsport kit was available to purchase for a short time direct from Renault France, but has now been discontinued, thus their value has increased.\n\nThe [[station wagon|estate]] version of the original M\u00e9gane was only available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] form, with no [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] variants being built, this could be due to the greater popularity of the Scenic in those markets. It was added with the facelift of 1999.\n\nIn Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], but in 1999 Renault acquired a stake in Japanese automaker [[Nissan]]. As a result of Renault's purchase, Yanase canceled its licensing contract for all Renault models sold in Japan, including, but not limited to, the M\u00e9gane I, in 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee for Renault cars.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Facelift===\nA mild facelift in spring 1999 gave the M\u00e9gane I a modified grille, more advanced safety features and upgraded equipment, and [[multi-valve|16 valve]] engines were used across the range. An Estate body style was also launched in mainland Europe with the facelift. The production continued for the Latin America Market, where it was sold alongside the M\u00e9gane II line at a considerably lower price until 2011.\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:2002 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.6 Front.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:2001 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.4.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:Renault Megane Coupe 1.6 16v 2000 (15037225005).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane coup\u00e9\nFile:Renault Megane Cupe (1).jpg|Renault M\u00e9gane Coup\u00e9 (Restyling)\nFile:2003 Renault M\u00e9gane (X64) Privilege convertible (20889553963).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane convertible\nFile:Renault M\u00e9gane I Phase II Grandtour 1.4 16V Fairway Heck.JPG|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane estate\n</gallery>\n\n===South America===\nIn countries such as Argentina and Colombia the M\u00e9gane I was available until 2010 sold as a sedan and an Estate, but in Venezuela was available only as a sedan. It features as the top line of the model the LA04 engine (16 valves, 1.6 litres and 110 HP), and was produced by both Renault Colombia and Renault Argentina, in where it was one of the best selling cars to date.\n\nIt is a car with more advanced safety features, upgraded equipment and more. The M\u00e9gane I had a lower price than the M\u00e9gane II.\n\nIn Venezuela, it was only available in one version: Unique, with a five speed manual gearbox or a four speed automatic one. Both of these were equipped with Abs and other extra equipment including driver and passenger front airbags, foglights, leather seats, electric mirrors and electric windows. In Argentina, not every version had features such as electric windows, electric mirrors or airbags.\n\n===Engines===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"\n!

This was the [[Clio Williams Maxi]], which was the first car truly developed for the F2 Kit Car category, and first appeared in 1996. However, rivals such as [[Citro\u00ebn]] and [[Peugeot]] soon introduced bigger and more powerful cars, which resulted in Renault producing an F2 version of the M\u00e9gane in 1996.

It was also announced that home quarantine will not be allowed anymore, because of some people leaving their house despite being quarantined. <ref name=\"home_quarantine\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/57996|title=For now no repatriation; commotion about quarantine decision (in Dutch)|website=Star News|access-date=7 April 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://covid-19.sr/repatrianten-allemaal-in-overheidsquarantaine/|title=Returnees all in government quarantine (in Dutch)|website=Covid Suriname|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAs of 9 April 2020, there are 893 stranded people of which 603 are in the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] and 88 in the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|United States]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://covid-19.sr/893-gestrande-surinamers-in-het-buitenland/|title=893 stranded Surinamese abroad (in Dutch)|website=Covid Suriname|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nOn 14 April, Danielle Veira has contacted Irene Lalji, a lawyer representing a hundred stranded citizens in the Netherlands, to inform her that they are preparing to schedule a first flight for repatriation this week, and increasing the capacity for quarantine. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.srherald.com/suriname/2020/04/14/lalji-veira-heeft-contact-met-ons-opgenomen/|title=Lalji: Veira has contact us (in Dutch)|access-date=14 April 2020|website=Suriname Herald}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{Graph:Chart\n| type = area\n| linewidth = 1\n| showSymbols = 1\n| yType= integer\n| width = 600\n| colors = #ff6347, cyan, black\n| xAxisTitle = Date\n| xAxisAngle = -40\n| x = 12 Mar, 13 Mar, 14 Mar, 15 Mar, 16 Mar, 17 Mar, 18 Mar, 19 Mar, 20 Mar, 21 Mar, 22 Mar, 23 Mar, 24 Mar, 25 Mar, 26 Mar, 27 Mar, 28 Mar, 29 Mar, 30 Mar, 31 Mar, 1 Apr, 2 Apr, 3 Apr, 4 Apr, 5 Apr, 6 Apr, 7 Apr, 8 Apr, 9 Apr, 10 Apr, 11 Apr, 12 Apr, 13 Apr, 14 Apr\n| yAxisTitle = No. of cases\n| y1 = 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10\n| y2 = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  1,  1,  1,  4,  5,  5,  5,  5,  5,  7,  7\n| y3 = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1\n| yGrid = \n| xGrid = \n|legend=\n|y1Title=Confirmed\n|y2Title=Recoveries\n|y3Title=Deaths}}\n\n==Crisis Management==\n[[File:Jerry Slijngard (cropped).jpg|thumb|Jerry Slijngard]]\nA National Public Health Response-team was set up in January 2020 who started to develop a response plan.
