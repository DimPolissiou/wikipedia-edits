Overall, it was significantly less severe than [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944\u201346|in Poland]]. The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948. The most notable incidents were the [[Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom]] on 24 September 1945, the Kolbasov massacre in December 1945, and the [[Partisan Congress riots]] in Bratislava in early August 1946. The violence ceased after the emigration of most Jews by the end of 1949.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|The Holocaust in Slovakia}}\n[[File:\"Nebu\u010f slu\u017eobn\u00edkom \u017eida\"\u2014Slovak propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Man kissing feet of another man with hooked nose, dropping money on his head|A Slovak State propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=0.9]]\nThe [[Slovak State]], a [[one-party state]] of the [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] (HS\u013dS), declared its independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] on 14 March 1939.

There were also conflicts regarding movable property that had been entrusted to non-Jewish individuals who refused to return it after the war. For many Slovaks, restitution meant returning property that they had paid for under the then-existing law, developed, and considered theirs. From the perspective of Jews, however, it was the obligation of those in possession of stolen property to return it.{{sfn|Bumov\u00e1|2007|p=27}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=330\u2013331, 336}} Former partisans, veterans of the Czechoslovak armies abroad, and political prisoners were prioritized for appointment as national administrators{{efn|name=national administrators|National administrators ({{lang-sk|n\u00e1rodn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vcovia}}) were the state-appointed managers of nationalized property Aryanized by the Slovak State regime, left behind by deported Jews, or confiscated from \"traitors and politically unreliable people\" (Germans and Hungarians) by the postwar Czechoslovak government.

On 22 July, 1,000 people participated in a partisan demonstration at which Captain Pal\u0161a advocated the \"cleansing\" of collaborators from the area. Antisemitic slogans were shouted, and some demonstrators went to a nearby bakery where white bread (forbidden by rationing laws) was supposedly being made for Jews. They confiscated the bread to give it to infirm individuals. The next morning a drunk Pal\u0161a was heard shouting \"the Jew was and always will be our enemy\". On  26 December 1945, two soldiers physically assaulted seven Jews in the town. In July, the rioting spread to the nearby city of [[Pre\u0161ov]], where non-Jews complained about the [[deportation of Czechoslovak citizens to the Soviet Union]]; Jews were [[Judeo-Bolshevism|accused of supporting Communism]]. Jewish community offices, a communal kitchen, and Jewish buildings were robbed and vandalized.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|pp=11\u201312}} \n\n===Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom===\n{{main|Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom}}\nIn [[Nitra]], local women were infuriated with inadequate food rations.

In early September, nuns who taught at a local Catholic school for girls heard that their institution was about to be nationalized, and that they would be replaced. Although many Slovak schools were nationalized in 1945, rumors that it was due to a Jewish conspiracy and that Jewish teachers would replace gentiles were unfounded. The mothers of children at the school petitioned the government not to nationalize it and accused Jews of trying to take over the school for the benefit of Jewish children.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} On Sunday, 23 September 1945, people threw stones at a young Jewish man at a train station and vandalized a house inhabited by Jews in nearby [[\u017dabokreky]].

Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called \"service\" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the [[Victorian era]], perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the [[Edwardian period]] (a period known in the United States as the [[Gilded Age]] and in France as the [[Belle \u00c9poque]]), which reflected the limited [[social mobility]] before [[World War I]].\n\n==Terminology==\nOther terms include '''domestic helper''', '''domestic servant''', '''manservant''' or '''menial'''.\n\n==History==\n[[ILO]] estimates in 2015, based on national surveys and/or censuses of 232 countries and territories, place the number of domestic workers at around 67.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|title=ILO Global estimates of migrant workers and migrant domestic workers: results and methodology|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329004937/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---com/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-29}}</ref> But the ILO itself states that \"experts say that due to the fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total number of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|title=100th ILO annual Conference decides to bring an estimated 53 to 100 million domestic workers worldwide under the realm of labour standards|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084648/http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-12-27}}</ref> The ILO also states that 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], it is estimated that eight percent of all women work as domestic workers.

It is not uncommon, however, for employers to hire servants illegally and fail to offer a work contract. Since domestic staff predominantly come from disadvantaged groups with less access to education, they are often vulnerable and uninformed of their rights, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, domestics employed without a proper contract can successfully sue their employers and be compensated for abuse committed. It is common in Brazil for domestic staff, including childcare staff, to be required to wear uniforms, while this requirement has fallen out of use in other countries.\n\nIn the [[United States]], domestic workers are generally excluded from many of the legal protections afforded to other classes of worker, including the provisions of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>See the UN Human Rights Committee's report, \"Domestic Workers' Rights in the United States.\"</ref> However, in recent years, advocacy groups like the [[National Domestic Workers Alliance|National Domestic Workers' Alliance]] have succeeded in passing a [[Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights|Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights]] into state law in New York, Hawaii, and California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html|title=The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers' Rights|last=Hilgers|first=Lauren|date=2019-02-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally domestic workers have mostly been women and are likely to be immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|title=Domestic Work and Workers|last=Graff|first=Daniel A.|date=n.d.|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2009-08-31|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513124817/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|archivedate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Currently, there are 1.8 million domestic workers, and tens of thousands of people are believed to be in forced labor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|title=The Home Economics of Domestic Workers|last=Bello|first=Grace|date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130131003736/http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|archivedate=January 31, 2013}}</ref> America's domestic home help workers, most of them female members of minority groups, earn low wages and often receive no retirement or health benefits because the lack of basic labor protections.\n\nDomestic workers are also excluded from vacation time, sick time, and overtime, and only thirteen percent of domestic workers get health insurance provided by their employers.

One of these causes is that with more women taking up full-time jobs, a dually employed household with children places a heavy burden on parents.

The Act influenced the creation of domestic service laws in other nations, although legislation tended to favour employers. However, before the passing of such Acts servants, and workers in general, had no protection in law. The only real advantage that domestic service provided was the provision of meals, accommodation, and sometimes clothes, in addition to a modest wage. Service was normally an [[apprentice]] system with room for advancement through the ranks.\n\nThe conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century movements for [[labour rights]], [[women's rights]] and immigrant rights, the conditions faced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment have come to the fore.\n\nIn 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] adopted the [[Convention on domestic workers|Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers]].

Though they often have their own quarters, their accommodations are not usually as comfortable as those reserved for the family members. In some cases, they sleep in the kitchen or small rooms, such as a [[box room]], sometimes located in the basement or attic. Domestic workers may live in their own home, though more often they are \"live-in\" domestics, meaning that they receive their [[room and board]] as part of their salaries. In some countries, because of the large gap between urban and rural incomes, and the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, even an ordinary middle class urban family can afford to employ a full-time live-in servant. The majority of domestic workers in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other populous developing countries, are people from the rural areas who are employed by urban families.\n\nEmployers may require their domestic workers to wear a [[uniform]], [[livery]] or other \"domestic workers' clothes\" when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] or [[black]] skirts with white belts and white [[blouse]]s, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple [[suit (clothing)|suit]], or a white [[dress shirt]], often with [[Necktie|tie]], and [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]].  In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve.  For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion.  In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.\n\nOn 30 March 2009, [[Peru]] adopted a law banning employers from requiring domestic workers to wear a uniform at public places.

Organizations such as [[Kalayaan (charity)|Kalayaan]] support the growing number of these [[migrant domestic workers]].\n\nThe migration of domestic workers can lead to several different effects both on the countries that are sending workers abroad and countries that are receiving domestic workers from abroad. One particular relationship between countries sending workers and countries receiving workers is that the sending country can be filling gaps in labor shortages of the receiving country.<ref name = \"Anderson\">\"Who needs migrant workers?

Bridget Anderson and Martin Ruhs, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) University of Oxford Working draft: 11th May 2009</ref> This relationship can be potentially beneficial for both countries involved because the demand for labor is being met and fulfilled by workers' demand for jobs. This relationship however can prove to be quite complicated and not always beneficial.

What studies are now starting to show is that women are dominating large numbers of the international migration patterns by taking up large percentages of domestic workers that leave their home country in search for work as a domestic laborer in another country.<ref>WOMEN AND MIGRATION: The Social Consequences of Gender, Silvia Pedraza, Department of Sociology and Program in American Culture, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109</ref>\n\nWomen who migrate to take up work as domestic workers are motivated by different reasons and migrate to a variety of different outcomes. While for many women, domestic work abroad is the only opportunity to find work and provide an income for their families, domestic labor is a market they are forced to enter due to blocked mobility in their homelands.<ref>INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION, DOMESTIC WORK, AND CARE WORK Undocumented Latina Migrants in Israel, Rebeca Raijman, University of Haifa, Israel, SILVINA SCHAMMAH-GESSER and ADRIANA KEMP, Tel Aviv University</ref> Additionally, migrant domestic workers often have to face the stress of leaving family members behind in their home countries while they take up work abroad.

In support, some argue that because domestic work occurs within the private sphere, which is seen as inherently feminine. This argument goes that the constructed link between domestic work and femininity<ref>Jindy Pettman. \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref> carries the implication that it is often referred to as 'domestic help,' and that domestic workers are referred to as 'nannies' or 'maids.' At least one author has argued that use of language compounded with the association with domestic work with femininities contributes to the exclusion of domestic work from the majority of national labour laws.<ref>Salleh, \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" 3.</ref>\n\nDue to a lack of economic opportunity in the Global South, many women with families leave their countries of origin and their own families to pursue work in the Global North. When they arrive in their country of destination, their work often entails caring for another family (including children and the elderly). Domestic workers often migrate to financially support their immediate family, extended family, and even other members of their community. While enduring dangerous and demeaning working and living conditions in the North, the majority of their wages are remitted to their countries of origin.<ref>Jindy Pettman, \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref>\n\nAn additional argument has been made that because their work takes place within the private sphere, they are often rendered invisible and employers are able to withhold their travel documents, confining them to their employers' home and inhibiting their access to legal redress. Those making this argument assert that the result of what they refer to as a power dynamic and an asserted lack of labour rights, is that domestic workers are often forbidden to contact their families and often go months, years, and even decades without seeing their families, whose lives their remittances are supporting.\n\nFurther, it has been argued that their ability to fill labour shortages and accept positions within the reproductive labour force that citizens of their host countries would reject underpins the development of the global capitalist system,<ref>Pettman, Jindy, \"Migration,\" 257.</ref> Simultaneously, and that they are enabling the beneficiaries of their remittances in the South to ascend the social ladder. To some, these arguments lead to a conclusion that both circumstances in the North and South constitute embodied debt through the improvement of one's life at the expense of another's hardship, and that the labour of such workers is too often not seen as work, due to the association of their gendered bodies with reproductive labour.\n\nHowever, on June 17, 2011, after 70 years of lobbying by civil society groups, the ILO adopted a convention with the aim of protecting and empowering domestic workers. Much of lobbying that contributed toward the ratification of ILO C189 was done by domestic workers groups, demonstrating that they are not merely victims but agents of change. That only two labour receiving countries have ratified the convention has been argued by some to demonstrates the reluctance of governments to acknowledge what such advocates see as a debt owed by society to such workers and to repay that perceived debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now%20 |title=Ratify and Implement ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers Now! |publisher=Mfasia.org |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080343/http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nSuch advocates assert that the ratification and enforcement of ILO C189 would mean that migrant domestic workers would enjoy the same labour rights as other more 'masculine' fields as well as the citizens of their destination countries. An incomplete list of basic rights guaranteed by ILO C189 under Article 7 includes: maximum working hours; fixed minimum wages; paid leave; provision of food and accommodation; and weekly rest periods. Guaranteeing these rights to migrant domestic workers would not constitute repayment the embodied debt owed to them, but they are entitled to these rights as they are both workers and human beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|title=Convention C189 - Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189)|website=www.ilo.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103064407/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|archivedate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\n[[File:Pilgrimage of Korea(n) lady.jpg|thumb|left|upright =2.0|Male servants carrying a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] and female maid with a traditional fan (Korea c.1904)]]\nAs women currently dominate the domestic labor market throughout the world, they have learned to navigate the system of domestic work both in their own countries and abroad in order to maximize the benefits of entering the domestic labor market.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of working as a domestic worker is the fact that women working in this sector are working in an area often regarded as a [[private sphere]].<ref name = \"Connelly\">Arat-Koc, S.

Their isolation is increased by their invisibility in the public sphere and the repetitive, intangible nature of their work decreases its value, making the workers themselves more dispensable.<ref name=\"Domestic Workers' Social Networks 1994 pp. 50-64\">Regulating the Unregulated?: Domestic Workers' Social Networks, Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, Social Problems, Vol. 41, No. 1, Special Issue on Immigration, Race, and Ethnicity in America (Feb., 1994), pp. 50\u201364</ref> The level of isolation women face also depends on the type of domestic work they are involved with. Live-in nannies for example may sacrifice much of their own independence and sometimes become increasingly isolated when they live with a family of which they are not part and away from their own.<ref>Pratt, Geraldine. \"From Registered Nurse to Registered Nanny: Discursive Geographies of Filipina Domestic Workers in Vancouver, BC*.\" Economic Geography 75.3 (1999): 215\u2013236.</ref>\n\nWhile working in a dominantly female privatized world can prove disadvantageous for domestic workers, many women have learned how to help one other move upward economically.

Some have to perform tasks considered degrading showing a manifestation of employer power over worker powerlessness. Employing domestic work from foreign countries can perpetuate the idea that domestic or service work is reserved for other social or racial groups and plays into the stereotype that it is work for inferior groups of people.<ref name = \"Anderson2\">Just Another Job?

Many subcontract their services to more established women workers, creating an important apprenticeship type of learning experience that can produce better, more independent opportunities in the future.<ref name = \"De Regt\"/> Women who work as domestic workers also gain some employment mobility.

In modern times, it has been a norm among upper and upper-middle-class families in the Philippines to hire at least one maidservant-caretaker (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya'') to care for the household and children. Most, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya''), live together in the house of their master's family with usually only a day off per month. This practice has eventually influenced the architecture of some houses or apartment condos where it has become a norm to section a room where domestic maidservants sleep as their personal room, usually near the kitchen or laundry area. Some wealthy families also section off an area or house where all the maidservants sleep or a part of the kitchen where they eat separate from the master's table. There are also employment agencies and special government laws regarding the regulation of domestic worker employment, such as the \"Domestic Workers Act\" or \"Batas Kasambahay\" in [https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10361_2013.html Republic Act No 10361]. Many live underpaid since many are informally hired or salaries are not declared truthfully to government offices or have an agreement instead to pay through other means, such as paying for their education, pension, or to send money back to their families. This practice was eventually exported to neighboring countries and all other countries that [[Overseas Filipino Worker|overseas Filipino workers]] (OFWs) have worked in, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and other countries in the [[Middle East]], and etc., hence some maidservants continue living with the same mindset of how domestic worker culture was practiced in the Philippines. This has also, at times, been used as a cause to look down upon overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the countries where they can be found. It has sometimes created controversies in other countries such as abuse charges in several countries in the Middle East or like the case of [[Flor Contemplacion]], who was executed in Singapore for murder allegations. There have also been documentaries or [[Romantic comedy|rom-com]] movies made in the Philippines about the plight or life of domestic workers, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay''/''yaya'').\n\n===Singapore===\nData from Singapore's Ministry of Manpower, showed that in June 2019 there were some 255,800 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers|title=Foreign workforce numbers|website=Ministry of Manpower Singapore|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The demand for Foreign Domestic Workers came about from the desire of the Singapore government to employ local women in the workforce.

The report stated that the Gulf country employed nearly 1.5 million women domestic workers from [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Philippines]]. Domestic workers estimated approximately 600,000 from Indonesia, 275,000 from Sri Lanka and 200,000 from Philippines. However, HRW reported that a number of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face a range of abuses. Besides, the organization also interviewed Saudi labor and social affairs official, who acknowledged the issue of domestic worker abuse. The report stated that no accurate figure exists to highlight the total violations of labor rights and other human rights that women migrant domestic workers confront in the Arab nation.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0708_1.pdf|title=\"As If I Am Not Human\" Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|accessdate=7 July 2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n==== Blacks post-Civil War to World War I ====\nIn the United States, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] legally ended in 1865, however, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] informed the former slaves now classified as freedmen and women that they could either sign labor contracts with white planters or be evicted from the land that they had lived on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|last=Armstrong|first=Trena|title=The hidden help : black domestic workers in the civil rights movement.|date=2012|publisher=University of Louisville|doi=10.18297/etd/46|language=en}}</ref> Most freedmen in the South signed labor contracts with their former white slave owners because that was the only work experience they had.  With limited skills and illiteracy, many men turned to become [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]], whereas the majority of women participated in domestic work. Not only were they not qualified for other jobs, but they were denied other jobs and segregated from American society purely based on the color of their skin. The South wanted to keep segregation alive and hence passed legislation such as the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]] post-Civil war which denied African Americans of legal equality and political rights.  These laws kept many African Americans as a second-class status up until new laws ended segregation in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=New York: Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=856\u2013858}}</ref>\n\nUp until the mid-twentieth century, domestic work was a prominent source of income for many women of different ethnic backgrounds. Many of these women were either African American or immigrants. More specifically, the post-civil war South had a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, there was also a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers in the North.  Many African American women migrated to the North for better work opportunities and higher wages compared to their employment options in the South. The African American women who worked as domestic workers were generally treated as poor, childlike beings that were seen as victims of their own ignorance of living in communities of crime and other societal infringements.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, despite the stereotypes labeled upon domestic workers, these women still settled for these positions because the only occupations that were open to African American women before World War I were domestic services.

This is because many white families lost their source of income and were not able to pay domestic workers to work in their home.  At this time, many domestic workers relied on asking strangers on the street for housework such as cleaning.  They house jumped, looking for any job that they could get. The domestic workforce was significantly impacted by the Great Depression which caused a decrease in their wages and an intolerable 18 hour workday.  Also, agricultural workers and the African American women working as domestic workers at this time were explicitly excluded from social security and the FLSA in the New Deal legislation.<ref name=\":1\" />  This is because the New Dealer politicians were more worried about losing support from the Southern Democrats in Congress who supported segregation rather than refusing coverage for many African Americans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans did not form labor unions because they lacked the resources, consciousness, and the access to networks used for union recruiting.  On top of that, the domestic workers would not typically have earned enough money to be able to afford being a part of a union.  Even if the African American domestic workers wanted to advance in society, it was nearly impossible because the racial structures in the United States rarely allowed them class mobility.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, domestic workers that were white such as the Irish and the Germans utilized working in middle-class homes to their advantage.  Working in the middle-class homes served to Americanize, allowing the workers to identify more with their employers than women of their own class and instilled an aspiration to become middle-class status.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Blacks in 1960s America ====\nNearly ninety percent of African American women worked as domestic workers during the Civil Rights Movement era.<ref name=\":0\" />  Their participation in the Civil Rights Movement went fairly undocumented, and despite their low-status career in the United States, they were beneficial for the betterment of society and the status of the African American race.  It has been noted that the southern African American women were the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nSince many white households relied on the African American domestic workers for housework, the workers were able to have a direct impact on the white race when rebelling for their civil rights.  The African American domestic workers boycotted buses and tried to register to vote, and many were denied and imprisoned. However, the domestic workers utilized imprisonment to educate other African American women on the Civil Rights Movement and what to do to contribute.  Additionally, typically the domestic workers rebelled in an informal manner, such as resisting to live in the same home in which they worked.  By doing this, the African American domestic workers transformed the domestic services, and collective organizations came about promoting a better work environment for African American domestic workers.

The term \"domestic service\" applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be \"in service\".<ref>\n{{cite OED | in service}}</ref> Domestic helpers perform a variety of household services for an individual or a family, from providing [[childcare|care for children]] and elderly dependents to [[housekeeping]], including cleaning and household maintenance. Other responsibilities may include [[cooking]], [[laundry]] and [[ironing]], shopping for food and other household errands. Such work has always needed to be done but before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advent of labour saving devices, it was physically much harder.\n\nSome domestic helpers live within their employer's household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work, while necessary, is demanding and undervalued. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anti-Slavery International|title=Domestic Work and Slavery|url=http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|website=Anti-Slavery.Org|publisher=Anti-Slavery International|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930183517/http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Servant'' is an older English word for \"domestic worker\", though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called \"service\" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the [[Victorian era]], perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the [[Edwardian period]] (a period known in the United States as the [[Gilded Age]] and in France as the [[Belle \u00c9poque]]), which reflected the limited [[social mobility]] before [[World War I]].\n\n==Terminology==\nOther terms include '''domestic helper''', '''domestic servant''', '''manservant''' or '''menial'''.\n\n==History==\n[[ILO]] estimates in 2015, based on national surveys and/or censuses of 232 countries and territories, place the number of domestic workers at around 67.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|title=ILO Global estimates of migrant workers and migrant domestic workers: results and methodology|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329004937/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---com/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-29}}</ref> But the ILO itself states that \"experts say that due to the fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total number of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|title=100th ILO annual Conference decides to bring an estimated 53 to 100 million domestic workers worldwide under the realm of labour standards|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084648/http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-12-27}}</ref> The ILO also states that 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], it is estimated that eight percent of all women work as domestic workers. They hardly have any legal protection. According to Guatemalan labor law, domestic work is \"subject neither to a working time statute nor to regulations on the maximum number of working hours in a day\".{{Contradict-inline|reason=First it says there are no restrictions on working time, then goes on to mention a couple.|date=May 2017}} Legally, domestic helpers are only entitled to ten hours of free time in 24 hours, and one day off per week.

It is not uncommon, however, for employers to hire servants illegally and fail to offer a work contract. Since domestic staff predominantly come from disadvantaged groups with less access to education, they are often vulnerable and uninformed of their rights, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, domestics employed without a proper contract can successfully sue their employers and be compensated for abuse committed. It is common in Brazil for domestic staff, including childcare staff, to be required to wear uniforms, while this requirement has fallen out of use in other countries.\n\nIn the [[United States]], domestic workers are generally excluded from many of the legal protections afforded to other classes of worker, including the provisions of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>See the UN Human Rights Committee's report, \"Domestic Workers' Rights in the United States.\"</ref> However, in recent years, advocacy groups like the [[National Domestic Workers Alliance|National Domestic Workers' Alliance]] have succeeded in passing a [[Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights|Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights]] into state law in New York, Hawaii, and California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html|title=The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers' Rights|last=Hilgers|first=Lauren|date=2019-02-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally domestic workers have mostly been women and are likely to be immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|title=Domestic Work and Workers|last=Graff|first=Daniel A.|date=n.d.|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2009-08-31|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513124817/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|archivedate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Currently, there are 1.8 million domestic workers, and tens of thousands of people are believed to be in forced labor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|title=The Home Economics of Domestic Workers|last=Bello|first=Grace|date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130131003736/http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|archivedate=January 31, 2013}}</ref> America's domestic home help workers, most of them female members of minority groups, earn low wages and often receive no retirement or health benefits because the lack of basic labor protections.\n\nDomestic workers are also excluded from vacation time, sick time, and overtime, and only thirteen percent of domestic workers get health insurance provided by their employers.

One of these causes is that with more women taking up full-time jobs, a dually employed household with children places a heavy burden on parents. It is argued however that this burden wouldn't result in the demand for outside domestic help if men and women were providing equal levels of effort in domestic work and child-rearing within their own home.<ref name = \"Connelly\"/>\n\nThe demand for domestic workers has also become primarily fulfilled by [[migrant domestic workers]] from other countries who flock to wealthier nations to fulfill the demand for help at home.<ref name = \"Castro\">\"Feminists and Domestic Workers; Muchachas No More: Domestic Workers in Latin America and the Caribbean\" by Elsa M.

The Act influenced the creation of domestic service laws in other nations, although legislation tended to favour employers. However, before the passing of such Acts servants, and workers in general, had no protection in law. The only real advantage that domestic service provided was the provision of meals, accommodation, and sometimes clothes, in addition to a modest wage. Service was normally an [[apprentice]] system with room for advancement through the ranks.\n\nThe conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century movements for [[labour rights]], [[women's rights]] and immigrant rights, the conditions faced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment have come to the fore.\n\nIn 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] adopted the [[Convention on domestic workers|Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers]].

Though they often have their own quarters, their accommodations are not usually as comfortable as those reserved for the family members. In some cases, they sleep in the kitchen or small rooms, such as a [[box room]], sometimes located in the basement or attic. Domestic workers may live in their own home, though more often they are \"live-in\" domestics, meaning that they receive their [[room and board]] as part of their salaries. In some countries, because of the large gap between urban and rural incomes, and the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, even an ordinary middle class urban family can afford to employ a full-time live-in servant. The majority of domestic workers in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other populous developing countries, are people from the rural areas who are employed by urban families.\n\nEmployers may require their domestic workers to wear a [[uniform]], [[livery]] or other \"domestic workers' clothes\" when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] or [[black]] skirts with white belts and white [[blouse]]s, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple [[suit (clothing)|suit]], or a white [[dress shirt]], often with [[Necktie|tie]], and [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]].  In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve.  For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion.  In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.\n\nOn 30 March 2009, [[Peru]] adopted a law banning employers from requiring domestic workers to wear a uniform at public places. However, it's not explained which punishments will be given to employers violating the law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.peruthisweek.com/news-8597-law-order-peru-domestic-servants-can-no-longer-be-forced-wear-uniforms-public|title=Peru: Domestic servants can no longer be forced to wear uniforms in public|publisher=Living in Peru|language=English|last=Guerra|first=Isabel|date=30 March 2009|accessdate=19 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170711/http://archive.peruthisweek.com/news-8597-law-order-peru-domestic-servants-can-no-longer-be-forced-wear-uniforms-public|archivedate=16 January 2017}}</ref> [[Chile]] adopted a similar law in 2014, also banning employers to require domestic workers to wear uniform at public places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|title=Housemaid-turned-rapper gives voice to suffering of domestic helpers in Latin America|publisher=South China Morning Post|language=English|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=15 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119050130/http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|title=Brazil rapper voices Latin housemaids' suffering|publisher=New Strait Times|language=English|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=15 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119050130/http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Child workers==\n{{Main|Child labour}}\n{{See also|Restavek}}\n[[File:Child Maid Servant.JPG|thumb|Child maid servant in [[India]].

There are at least one million domestic workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] under the [[kafala system]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Major sources of domestic workers include [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Ethiopia]]. Taiwan also imports domestic workers from [[Vietnam]] and [[Mongolia]]. Organizations such as [[Kalayaan (charity)|Kalayaan]] support the growing number of these [[migrant domestic workers]].\n\nThe migration of domestic workers can lead to several different effects both on the countries that are sending workers abroad and countries that are receiving domestic workers from abroad. One particular relationship between countries sending workers and countries receiving workers is that the sending country can be filling gaps in labor shortages of the receiving country.<ref name = \"Anderson\">\"Who needs migrant workers? Introduction to the analysis of staff shortages, immigration and public policy\". Bridget Anderson and Martin Ruhs, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) University of Oxford Working draft: 11th May 2009</ref> This relationship can be potentially beneficial for both countries involved because the demand for labor is being met and fulfilled by workers' demand for jobs. This relationship however can prove to be quite complicated and not always beneficial. When unemployment in a receiving country rises migrant domestic workers are not only no longer needed but their presence can be detrimental to domestic workers of that country.<ref name = \"Anderson\"/>\n\nWhen international migration began to flourish the assumed migrant worker was typically considered to be a man. What studies are now starting to show is that women are dominating large numbers of the international migration patterns by taking up large percentages of domestic workers that leave their home country in search for work as a domestic laborer in another country.<ref>WOMEN AND MIGRATION: The Social Consequences of Gender, Silvia Pedraza, Department of Sociology and Program in American Culture, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109</ref>\n\nWomen who migrate to take up work as domestic workers are motivated by different reasons and migrate to a variety of different outcomes. While for many women, domestic work abroad is the only opportunity to find work and provide an income for their families, domestic labor is a market they are forced to enter due to blocked mobility in their homelands.<ref>INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION, DOMESTIC WORK, AND CARE WORK Undocumented Latina Migrants in Israel, Rebeca Raijman, University of Haifa, Israel, SILVINA SCHAMMAH-GESSER and ADRIANA KEMP, Tel Aviv University</ref> Additionally, migrant domestic workers often have to face the stress of leaving family members behind in their home countries while they take up work abroad. Upward mobility is particularly difficult for migrant domestic workers because their opportunities are often limited by their illegal status putting a very definite limitation on the work that is available to them as well as their power to negotiate with employers<ref name=\"De Regt\"/>\n\n==Advocacy for migrant workers== <!-- This section needs to be adapted / absorbed into another section in this article-->\n\nSome argue that personal sacrifices of domestic workers has helped to underpin economic and social development globally. Ariel Salleh's article \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt\", defines embodied debt as \"debt owed by the Global North and Global South to the 'reproductive workers' who produce and maintain the new labour force.\"<ref>Ariel Salleh, ed. \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" in Eco-Sufficiency and Global Justice (Pluto Press: London, 2009) 5.</ref> According to the ILO, women constitute 80% of domestic workers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tran |first=Mark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/09/ilo-better-pay-domestic-workers |title=ILO urges better pay and conditions for 53 million domestic workers &#124; Global development |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031331/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/09/ilo-better-pay-domestic-workers |archivedate=2014-10-29 }}</ref>  The substantially high percentage of women in domestic work some argue results from this sector's association with motherhood, leading to an assumption that domestic work is by nature the work of females. In support, some argue that because domestic work occurs within the private sphere, which is seen as inherently feminine. This argument goes that the constructed link between domestic work and femininity<ref>Jindy Pettman. \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref> carries the implication that it is often referred to as 'domestic help,' and that domestic workers are referred to as 'nannies' or 'maids.' At least one author has argued that use of language compounded with the association with domestic work with femininities contributes to the exclusion of domestic work from the majority of national labour laws.<ref>Salleh, \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" 3.</ref>\n\nDue to a lack of economic opportunity in the Global South, many women with families leave their countries of origin and their own families to pursue work in the Global North. When they arrive in their country of destination, their work often entails caring for another family (including children and the elderly). Domestic workers often migrate to financially support their immediate family, extended family, and even other members of their community. While enduring dangerous and demeaning working and living conditions in the North, the majority of their wages are remitted to their countries of origin.<ref>Jindy Pettman, \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref>\n\nAn additional argument has been made that because their work takes place within the private sphere, they are often rendered invisible and employers are able to withhold their travel documents, confining them to their employers' home and inhibiting their access to legal redress. Those making this argument assert that the result of what they refer to as a power dynamic and an asserted lack of labour rights, is that domestic workers are often forbidden to contact their families and often go months, years, and even decades without seeing their families, whose lives their remittances are supporting.\n\nFurther, it has been argued that their ability to fill labour shortages and accept positions within the reproductive labour force that citizens of their host countries would reject underpins the development of the global capitalist system,<ref>Pettman, Jindy, \"Migration,\" 257.</ref> Simultaneously, and that they are enabling the beneficiaries of their remittances in the South to ascend the social ladder. To some, these arguments lead to a conclusion that both circumstances in the North and South constitute embodied debt through the improvement of one's life at the expense of another's hardship, and that the labour of such workers is too often not seen as work, due to the association of their gendered bodies with reproductive labour.\n\nHowever, on June 17, 2011, after 70 years of lobbying by civil society groups, the ILO adopted a convention with the aim of protecting and empowering domestic workers. Much of lobbying that contributed toward the ratification of ILO C189 was done by domestic workers groups, demonstrating that they are not merely victims but agents of change. That only two labour receiving countries have ratified the convention has been argued by some to demonstrates the reluctance of governments to acknowledge what such advocates see as a debt owed by society to such workers and to repay that perceived debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now%20 |title=Ratify and Implement ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers Now! |publisher=Mfasia.org |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080343/http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nSuch advocates assert that the ratification and enforcement of ILO C189 would mean that migrant domestic workers would enjoy the same labour rights as other more 'masculine' fields as well as the citizens of their destination countries. An incomplete list of basic rights guaranteed by ILO C189 under Article 7 includes: maximum working hours; fixed minimum wages; paid leave; provision of food and accommodation; and weekly rest periods. Guaranteeing these rights to migrant domestic workers would not constitute repayment the embodied debt owed to them, but they are entitled to these rights as they are both workers and human beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|title=Convention C189 - Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189)|website=www.ilo.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103064407/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|archivedate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\n[[File:Pilgrimage of Korea(n) lady.jpg|thumb|left|upright =2.0|Male servants carrying a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] and female maid with a traditional fan (Korea c.1904)]]\nAs women currently dominate the domestic labor market throughout the world, they have learned to navigate the system of domestic work both in their own countries and abroad in order to maximize the benefits of entering the domestic labor market.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of working as a domestic worker is the fact that women working in this sector are working in an area often regarded as a [[private sphere]].<ref name = \"Connelly\">Arat-Koc, S.

Their isolation is increased by their invisibility in the public sphere and the repetitive, intangible nature of their work decreases its value, making the workers themselves more dispensable.<ref name=\"Domestic Workers' Social Networks 1994 pp. 50-64\">Regulating the Unregulated?: Domestic Workers' Social Networks, Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, Social Problems, Vol. 41, No. 1, Special Issue on Immigration, Race, and Ethnicity in America (Feb., 1994), pp. 50\u201364</ref> The level of isolation women face also depends on the type of domestic work they are involved with.

Some have to perform tasks considered degrading showing a manifestation of employer power over worker powerlessness.

In modern times, it has been a norm among upper and upper-middle-class families in the Philippines to hire at least one maidservant-caretaker (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya'') to care for the household and children. Most, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya''), live together in the house of their master's family with usually only a day off per month. This practice has eventually influenced the architecture of some houses or apartment condos where it has become a norm to section a room where domestic maidservants sleep as their personal room, usually near the kitchen or laundry area. Some wealthy families also section off an area or house where all the maidservants sleep or a part of the kitchen where they eat separate from the master's table. There are also employment agencies and special government laws regarding the regulation of domestic worker employment, such as the \"Domestic Workers Act\" or \"Batas Kasambahay\" in [https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10361_2013.html Republic Act No 10361]. Many live underpaid since many are informally hired or salaries are not declared truthfully to government offices or have an agreement instead to pay through other means, such as paying for their education, pension, or to send money back to their families. This practice was eventually exported to neighboring countries and all other countries that [[Overseas Filipino Worker|overseas Filipino workers]] (OFWs) have worked in, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and other countries in the [[Middle East]], and etc., hence some maidservants continue living with the same mindset of how domestic worker culture was practiced in the Philippines. This has also, at times, been used as a cause to look down upon overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the countries where they can be found. It has sometimes created controversies in other countries such as abuse charges in several countries in the Middle East or like the case of [[Flor Contemplacion]], who was executed in Singapore for murder allegations. There have also been documentaries or [[Romantic comedy|rom-com]] movies made in the Philippines about the plight or life of domestic workers, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay''/''yaya'').\n\n===Singapore===\nData from Singapore's Ministry of Manpower, showed that in June 2019 there were some 255,800 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers|title=Foreign workforce numbers|website=Ministry of Manpower Singapore|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The demand for Foreign Domestic Workers came about from the desire of the Singapore government to employ local women in the workforce.

The report stated that the Gulf country employed nearly 1.5 million women domestic workers from [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Philippines]]. Domestic workers estimated approximately 600,000 from Indonesia, 275,000 from Sri Lanka and 200,000 from Philippines. However, HRW reported that a number of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face a range of abuses. Besides, the organization also interviewed Saudi labor and social affairs official, who acknowledged the issue of domestic worker abuse. The report stated that no accurate figure exists to highlight the total violations of labor rights and other human rights that women migrant domestic workers confront in the Arab nation.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0708_1.pdf|title=\"As If I Am Not Human\" Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|accessdate=7 July 2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n==== Blacks post-Civil War to World War I ====\nIn the United States, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] legally ended in 1865, however, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] informed the former slaves now classified as freedmen and women that they could either sign labor contracts with white planters or be evicted from the land that they had lived on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|last=Armstrong|first=Trena|title=The hidden help : black domestic workers in the civil rights movement.|date=2012|publisher=University of Louisville|doi=10.18297/etd/46|language=en}}</ref> Most freedmen in the South signed labor contracts with their former white slave owners because that was the only work experience they had.  With limited skills and illiteracy, many men turned to become [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]], whereas the majority of women participated in domestic work. Not only were they not qualified for other jobs, but they were denied other jobs and segregated from American society purely based on the color of their skin. The South wanted to keep segregation alive and hence passed legislation such as the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]] post-Civil war which denied African Americans of legal equality and political rights.  These laws kept many African Americans as a second-class status up until new laws ended segregation in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=New York: Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=856\u2013858}}</ref>\n\nUp until the mid-twentieth century, domestic work was a prominent source of income for many women of different ethnic backgrounds. Many of these women were either African American or immigrants. More specifically, the post-civil war South had a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, there was also a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers in the North.  Many African American women migrated to the North for better work opportunities and higher wages compared to their employment options in the South. The African American women who worked as domestic workers were generally treated as poor, childlike beings that were seen as victims of their own ignorance of living in communities of crime and other societal infringements.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, despite the stereotypes labeled upon domestic workers, these women still settled for these positions because the only occupations that were open to African American women before World War I were domestic services.  It was necessary they worked along with their husbands in order to keep their families financially supported.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Vanessa|date=March 2012|title=Working at Home: Domestic Workers in the Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century United States|journal=History Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=284\u2013293|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00832.x|issn=1478-0542}}</ref>\n\nFrequently underpaid, African American servants commonly took food scraps and discarded clothing from their employers in a practice known as \u201c[[pan toting]]\u201d or the \u201cservice pan\u201d.<ref name=Hunter-132>{{citation | last = Hunter | first = Tera W. | title = To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Massachusetts | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0674893092 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674893092/page/132 132] | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674893092/page/132 }}</ref> The service pan augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers\u2019 households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.<ref name=Sharpless-74>{{citation | last = Sharpless | first = Rebecca | title = Cooking in Other Women\u2019s Kitchens: Domestic Workers in the South, 1865-1960 | location = Chapel Hill | publisher = University of North Carolina | year = 2010 | page = 74}}</ref> The pan system was used by employers to justify paying a lower wage,<ref name=Sharpless-154>Sharpless, p. 154.</ref> and used by domestic workers to counter their employers\u2019 dishonesty.<ref name=Hunter-132 /> Whites also pointed to the practice of pan toting as proof that \u201ca Negro could not help but steal\u201d, thereby reinforcing stereotypes of \u201cblack inferiority and dependency\u201d and rationalizing racist paternalism.<ref name=Sharpless-154 />\n\n==== Blacks in the Great Depression ====\nDuring the Great Depression, many domestic workers lost their jobs.  This is because many white families lost their source of income and were not able to pay domestic workers to work in their home.  At this time, many domestic workers relied on asking strangers on the street for housework such as cleaning.  They house jumped, looking for any job that they could get. The domestic workforce was significantly impacted by the Great Depression which caused a decrease in their wages and an intolerable 18 hour workday.  Also, agricultural workers and the African American women working as domestic workers at this time were explicitly excluded from social security and the FLSA in the New Deal legislation.<ref name=\":1\" />  This is because the New Dealer politicians were more worried about losing support from the Southern Democrats in Congress who supported segregation rather than refusing coverage for many African Americans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans did not form labor unions because they lacked the resources, consciousness, and the access to networks used for union recruiting.  On top of that, the domestic workers would not typically have earned enough money to be able to afford being a part of a union.  Even if the African American domestic workers wanted to advance in society, it was nearly impossible because the racial structures in the United States rarely allowed them class mobility.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, domestic workers that were white such as the Irish and the Germans utilized working in middle-class homes to their advantage.  Working in the middle-class homes served to Americanize, allowing the workers to identify more with their employers than women of their own class and instilled an aspiration to become middle-class status.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Blacks in 1960s America ====\nNearly ninety percent of African American women worked as domestic workers during the Civil Rights Movement era.<ref name=\":0\" />  Their participation in the Civil Rights Movement went fairly undocumented, and despite their low-status career in the United States, they were beneficial for the betterment of society and the status of the African American race.  It has been noted that the southern African American women were the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nSince many white households relied on the African American domestic workers for housework, the workers were able to have a direct impact on the white race when rebelling for their civil rights.  The African American domestic workers boycotted buses and tried to register to vote, and many were denied and imprisoned. However, the domestic workers utilized imprisonment to educate other African American women on the Civil Rights Movement and what to do to contribute.  Additionally, typically the domestic workers rebelled in an informal manner, such as resisting to live in the same home in which they worked.  By doing this, the African American domestic workers transformed the domestic services, and collective organizations came about promoting a better work environment for African American domestic workers.  Their act of rebellion gave way for a change of how they were treated, how they were paid, and how they were respected.\n\n==Varieties of domestic workers==\n[[File:A valet in India.jpg|thumb|A [[valet]] in India, c. 1870]]\n[[File:Amesservants.jpg|thumb|The servants at Stonehouse Hill, the estate of F.

The evil Milady de Winter, who wants revenge on junior musketeer d'Artagnan, seduces him to keep him occupied. He soon discovers her true nature, however, and also that she was once married to his fellow musketeer Athos, who had supposedly killed her after discovering that she was a branded criminal.\n\nThe trio of musketeers \u2014 Athos, Porthos, and Aramis \u2014 rescue Constance from imprisonment in Rochefort's abode of Saint Cloud and take her to safety in the convent of Armentieres. De Winter sends d'Artagnan poisoned wine and a note intended to trick him into thinking that the trio have been imprisoned for drunkenness. On his way to bail them out, d'Artagnan is attacked by Rochefort and his men. The trio join the fight, and Rochefort flees. One of his men is captured and tortured for information, revealing that Richelieu is going to the Dovecote Inn near La Rochelle, but then drinks the poisoned wine and dies, revealing de Winter's trap. The trio then proceed to the inn where they spy on Richelieu. The Cardinal orders de Winter to threaten the Duke of Buckingham with exposure of his affair with the Queen, to discourage him from sending a relief force to aid the rebels; she is to kill the Duke if he does not comply. In return, de Winter asks for a warrant, so she can kill d'Artagnan and Constance. Richelieu reluctantly signs one, wording it in a way that leaves no evidence against himself: \"By my order and for the good of the state, the bearer has done what has been done.\"\n\nAfter revealing himself to de Winter, Athos takes the death warrant from her and later tells d'Artagnan of the plot. D'Artagnan sends his servant Planchet to warn the Duke. In England, de Winter asks Buckingham not to help the rebels, but he refuses. De Winter tries to assassinate him, but she is captured. Buckingham has his servant Felton lock her away in the [[Tower of London]], but she seduces Felton and convinces him that Buckingham is his enemy. Felton helps her to escape and return to France, then murders Buckingham before Planchet can warn him. Soon after, La Rochelle surrenders.\n\nRochefort and de Winter are still intent on killing d'Artagnan and Constance. With a force of guards, they occupy the convent at Armentieres and battle all four musketeers when they arrive. While Rochefort and his men hold the musketeers at bay, de Winter strangles Constance.  Athos captures de Winter; D'Artagnan duels Rochefort and apparently kills him with a lunge through the chest (though it is revealed in the sequel ''The Return of the Musketeers'' that he actually survived the wound). The four musketeers sentence de Winter to death by beheading, and they hire an executioner to carry out the punishment. Afterward, they are arrested by the Cardinal's guards.\n\nRichelieu charges d'Artagnan with murder for killing a valuable servant of the State, but d'Artagnan shows him the signed death warrant which, due to its ambiguous phrasing, appears to authorize d'Artagnan's actions. Defeated and quite impressed at d'Artagnan's achievement, the Cardinal offers him a commission for either him or one of his three friends to become an officer. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis all reject it, and d'Artagnan is promoted to Lieutenant of the Musketeers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] as [[d\u2019artagnan]]\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]]\n* [[Frank Finlay]] as [[Porthos]]\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as [[Aramis]]\n* [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] as  [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as [[Anne of Austria]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Milady de Winter]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as the [[Comte de Rochefort|Count De Rochefort]]\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Constance Bonacieux\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Planchet\n* [[Michael Gothard]] as [[John Felton (assassin)|Felton]]\n* [[Nicole Calfan]] as Kitty\n\n==Production==\nDuring production on ''The Three Musketeers'', the producers realized that the project was so lengthy that they would not be able to complete it as initially intended \u2014 as a roadshow epic with intermission \u2014 and still achieve their announced release date.
