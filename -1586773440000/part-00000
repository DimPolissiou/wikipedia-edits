The Young Nationals have been a strong lobby group inside the National Party, and often at the forefront of policy development being representative as a ''Core Group'' or a ''Policy Action Group'' of the party at varying times. For a short period during the party's earlier years there was a younger section of the National party for pre-teenage members but has since disappeared due to the changing environment of New Zealand politics and society.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nPrior to the group being named the Young Nationals, the New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National Party's]] Youth section was known as the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In the lead up to the 1949 election, the  Wellington branch had 3,500 members and the Auckland branch consisted of 2,500 members.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=256}} The group hosted a number of community events such as dances, parties, debating/discussion, and Lectures/addresses. In 1967 the group voted to change the name to the Young Nationals as Junior Nationals was seen to have potentially negative connotations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} This renamed group attracted members for political reasons rather than social activities like its predecessor.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In 1968 the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] agreed to for two Young Nationals to sit on the party's Dominion Council.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} 1971 brought upon Young Nationals creating political discussion groups called 'Pol Link's' which enabled the group to research and discuss political issues allowing the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] to understand the contemporary issues of young generations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=263}} In 2015 the Young Nationals claimed to have over 20,000 [[Facebook likes|likes]] on their Facebook page and over 6,000 official members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=National at 80 Years: The Story of the New Zealand National Party|last=James|first=Colin|publisher=Bateman|year=2017|isbn=|location=Auckland|page=283}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nIn 2009, under major changes led by the organisation's governing executive, the Young Nationals were re-organised to serve as a more effective tool for policy activism and campaign activity.\n\n===Regional Teams===\n\nAs of 2011, The Young Nationals are divided into five regions nationwide:\n\n* Northern; \n* Central North Island; \n* Lower North Island; \n* Canterbury-Westland; \n* and Southern. \n\nEach of these regions are headed by their own Chair and executive group and supervised by a National Executive, elected annually during the National Party Conference.\n\nSome regions of the Young Nationals also may have branches. These include the ''Alfred Street Young Nationals'',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/alfredstreetnational |title= Alfred Street Young Nationals}}</ref> which are based in Auckland and considered a counter group to the [[Princes Street Labour]] movement and ''VicNats''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/VicNats/127981860617677 |title=VicNats}}</ref> which is based around [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]].

There are currently 12 members. They are made of a:\n\n* President;\n* Vice-President;\n* Secretary;\n* Treasurer;\n* Policy Chair;\n* Creative Director; And\n* The Chairs of Each of the Regional Executives<ref>https://youngnats.national.org.nz/your_team</ref>\n\n==Policies==\nOften the more liberal views of the Young Nationals have been at odds with those of the wider party. The shift in party opinion in areas such as the nuclear ships debate, economic reform, liquor law reform, and anti-discrimination laws has often been influenced by the Young Nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youngnats.national.org.nz/our_story|title=Our Story|website=Young Nats|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===LGBT rights===\n'''Gay Conversion Therapy Ban'''\n\nThe Young Nationals support the banning of gay conversion therapy following membership consultation on the issue after [[New Zealand Young Labour|Young Labour]] and the [[Young Greens of Aotearoa New Zealand|Young Greens]] petitioned for a ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10157546507852622&set=a.10150192999352622 |title=NZ Young Nats - The Young Nats are proud to add our voice... |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Robson |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/362130/young-labour-young-greens-launch-petition-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy |title=Young Labour, Young Greens launch petition to ban gay conversion therapy &#124; RNZ News |publisher=Rnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n'''Marriage Equality'''\n\nThe Young Nationals supported Marriage Equality, with members lobbying MPs for this change.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davison|first=Isaac|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10829817|title=Young MPs join to support marriage equality|date=2012-08-27|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>\n\n===Drug policy===\n\n==== Pill testing ====\nIn late 2019, the Young Nationals moved to support pill testing at festivals and concerts.

Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first presented on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.
