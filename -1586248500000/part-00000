Each goal equals three points. For example, 2-38 = 2 goals and 38 points, making a total of 2 x 3 + 38 = 44 points. See [[Gaelic football#Scoring|GAA scoring rules]] for more information.\n*B. {{Note|sevens}}Sevens is a form of Gaelic football where teams consist of seven players instead of the normal 15. Games are shorter, faster, more open and higher-scoring than normal football.\n*C. {{Note|championship}}The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] is the premier inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] (plus [[New York GAA|New York]] and [[London GAA|London]]). \n\nEach county participates in their respective provincial championship (in Derry's case the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]]) which operate through a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] cup competition format. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams that fail to win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending on how far they reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals.<ref>See [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship#Current format|here]] for more details.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article6544899.ece Interview with The Sunday Times (July 2009)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080907145231/http://www.gaeliclife.com/video.html Interview with Gaelic Life ahead of 2008 International Rules Series]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/7858865.stm Interview with BBC (January 2009)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071227203315/http://www.cul4kidz.com/culstarsfball_bradley.htm Cul4kidz interview]\n*[http://www.derrygaa.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=666&Itemid=184 Player profiles on Official Derry GAA website]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports|gaa}}\n{{succession box|\n before=[[Se\u00e1n Marty Lockhart]]|\n title=[[Derry GAA|Derry]] senior<br/> football [[Captain (sport)|captain]]|\n years=2005|\n after=[[Johnny McBride]]\n}}\n{{succession box|\n before=[[Conleith Gilligan]]<br/>([[Ballinderry GAC|Ballinderry]])|\n title=[[Derry Senior Football Championship]]<br/>winning [[Captain (sport)|captain]]|\n years=2007|\n after=[[Enda Muldoon]]<br/>([[Ballinderry GAC|Ballinderry]])\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Derry Football Squads\n|bg=white\n|fg=red\n|list1=\n{{Derry NFL Team 2000}}\n{{Derry NFL Team 2008}}\n{{Derry NFL Team 2009}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Ireland International Rules Football Squads\n|bg=green\n|fg=white\n|list1=\n{{2008 Ireland international rules football team}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Awards\n|titlestyle=background: gold\n|list1=\n{{7th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{10th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{11th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{12th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{13th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{2007 All Stars}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bradley, Paddy}}\n[[Category:1981 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Derry inter-county Gaelic footballers]]\n[[Category:Gaelic football forwards]]\n[[Category:Glenullin Gaelic footballers]]\n[[Category:Irish international rules football players]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox GAA player \n| image          = Paddy Bradley Ulster League final.jpg\n| name           = Paddy Bradley\n| size           = 150px\n| irish          = \n| nickname       =\n| feet           = 5\n| inches         = 11\n| weight         = {{convert|14|st|kg|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"profiles\"/>\n| occupation     = Teacher <ref name=\"profiles\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.derrygaa.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=666&Itemid=184 |title=Derry player profiles 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2009 |work=Official Derry GAA website|publisher=derrygaa.ie }}</ref>\n| sport          = Gaelic football\n| code           = Football\n| county         = Derry\n| province       = Ulster\n| clposition     = Full forward\n| club           = [[Glenullin GAC|Glenullin]]\n| clyears        = 1997 \u2013 present\n| clapps(points) \n| clcounty       = 1\n| clprovince     = Ulster\n| clubs          = Glenullin\n| counties       = Derry\n| icposition     = Full forward\n| icyears        = 1999 \u2013 2012\n| icapps(points) = 44 (13-177 (216))<ref name=\"hot shots\">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/the_championship/7535488.stm |title= Ulster's hot-shots |accessdate=29 November 2008 |date=31 July 2008 |work=BBC Sport Online }}</ref>\n| icprovince      = 0\n| icallireland    = 0\n| nfl             = 2\n| allstars        = 1\n| icupdate        = 21:28, 14 September 2008 (UTC) (UTC)<br/>Includes Championship games only\n| clupdate        =\n| birth_date      = {{Birth date and age|1981|5|23|df=yes}}\n| birth_place     = \n}}\n\n'''Patrick Bradley''' (born 23 May 1981<ref name=\"profiles\"/>) is a sportsman from [[Northern Ireland]], who plays [[Gaelic football]] for [[Derry GAA|Derry]].

Each goal equals three points. For example, 2-38 = 2 goals and 38 points, making a total of 2 x 3 + 38 = 44 points. See [[Gaelic football#Scoring|GAA scoring rules]] for more information.\n*B. {{Note|sevens}}Sevens is a form of Gaelic football where teams consist of seven players instead of the normal 15. Games are shorter, faster, more open and higher-scoring than normal football.\n*C. {{Note|championship}}The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] is the premier inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] (plus [[New York GAA|New York]] and [[London GAA|London]]). \n\nEach county participates in their respective provincial championship (in Derry's case the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]]) which operate through a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] cup competition format. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams that fail to win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending on how far they reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals.<ref>See [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship#Current format|here]] for more details.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article6544899.ece Interview with The Sunday Times (July 2009)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080907145231/http://www.gaeliclife.com/video.html Interview with Gaelic Life ahead of 2008 International Rules Series]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/7858865.stm Interview with BBC (January 2009)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071227203315/http://www.cul4kidz.com/culstarsfball_bradley.htm Cul4kidz interview]\n*[http://www.derrygaa.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=666&Itemid=184 Player profiles on Official Derry GAA website]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports|gaa}}\n{{succession box|\n before=[[Se\u00e1n Marty Lockhart]]|\n title=[[Derry GAA|Derry]] senior<br/> football [[Captain (sport)|captain]]|\n years=2005|\n after=[[Johnny McBride]]\n}}\n{{succession box|\n before=[[Conleith Gilligan]]<br/>([[Ballinderry GAC|Ballinderry]])|\n title=[[Derry Senior Football Championship]]<br/>winning [[Captain (sport)|captain]]|\n years=2007|\n after=[[Enda Muldoon]]<br/>([[Ballinderry GAC|Ballinderry]])\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Derry Football Squads\n|bg=white\n|fg=red\n|list1=\n{{Derry NFL Team 2000}}\n{{Derry NFL Team 2008}}\n{{Derry NFL Team 2009}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Ireland International Rules Football Squads\n|bg=green\n|fg=white\n|list1=\n{{2008 Ireland international rules football team}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Awards\n|titlestyle=background: gold\n|list1=\n{{7th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{10th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{11th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{12th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{13th Irish News Ulster All Stars}}\n{{2007 All Stars}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bradley, Paddy}}\n[[Category:1981 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Derry inter-county Gaelic footballers]]\n[[Category:Gaelic football forwards]]\n[[Category:Glenullin Gaelic footballers]]\n[[Category:Irish international rules football players]]\n", "name_user": "78.18.225.135", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEarly and personal life:Fixed place name)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Bradley"}

It is now within the [[South Lakeland]] local government district, but is still a \"Yorkshire Dale\" for planning purposes.\n\nGarsdale is on the western slopes of the [[Pennines]], between [[Baugh Fell]] to the north, and [[Rise Hill]] to the south. It is within the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]].  The dale is the valley of the [[Clough River]], which rises on the north eastern slopes of Baugh Fell and flows through Grisedale, the ''Dale that Died'', as Grisedale Beck until it becomes the Clough River at [[Garsdale Head]].\n\nThe dale forms the [[civil parish]] of Garsdale (though the last mile and a half of the course of the Clough river, before its confluence with the Rawthey, is part of the parish of [[Sedbergh]]).

The formation of the Dal Khalsa occurred shortly after an [[wikt:infamous|infamous]] clash between Sikhs belonging to the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] and the followers of a Sikh sect known as the [[Nirankari]]s (whom other Sikhs regard as [[Heresy|heretics]]).

A demand that was supported by other Sikh organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]] and one which was later taken up with the Indian government by the [[SGPC]] in 1980. However, the Indian government made no decision on the demand to declare Amritsar a \"holy city\" which prompted the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Students Federation to organise a procession on 31 May 1981. The [[Hindu]] community was opposed to the demand of declaring Amritsar a \"holy city\" and held their own parallel procession in Amritsar on 29 May 1981.\n\nFor the first time the flag of [[Khalistan]] was hoisted on 1 August 1980, by activists of the Dal Khalsa at the spot in [[Amritsar]] where 13 Sikhs had been killed during a clash with the Nirankaris on 13 April 1978. Shortly after activists of the Dal Khalsa again raised the flag of [[Khalistan]] at various places in the Punjab state during India's Independence day on 15 August 1980.\n\nDuring 1981 the Dal Khalsa along with other [[Sikh]] organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]], [[SGPC]] and [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] demanded associate membership in the [[United Nations]] for the 'Sikh Nation'. Owing largely to the Dal Khalsa a resolution to this effect was passed at the \"Sikh Educational Conference\" held in [[Chandigarh]] on 15 March 1981, which had been organised by the [[Chief Khalsa Diwan]]. During this event American based [[Khalistan]] protagonist, [[Ganga Singh Dhillon]], delivered a speech on why the Sikhs are a [[nation]] and slogans of \"Khalistan Zindabad\" (Long live Khalistan) were raised at the event.\n\n===Activity resulting in a temporary ban on Dal Khalsa===\n\nA 10-year ban was put on the Dal Khalsa by the Indian government in 1982 following militant activities carried out by the organization.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\">http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/INT/HTML/INT/0-0-0-7314/0-0-0-8312.html</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVcG7EkuPgAC&pg=PA628&lpg=PA628&dq=%22dal+khalsa%22+1982#v=onepage&q=%22dal%20khalsa%22%20&f=false |title = Historical Dictionary of Terrorism|isbn = 9780810863118|last1 = Sloan|first1 = Stephen|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Sean K.|date = 3 August 2009}}</ref> These included several plane hijackings such as the 1981 hijacking of an Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737). The plane was hijacked on 29 September 1981, by five members of the Dal Khalsa as a form of protest against the arrest of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] who had been accused of being involved in the murder of [[Jalandhar]] based Hindu newspaper owner [[Jagat Narain]] later on Ranjit Singh confessed to murdered Jagat Narain. Ranjit Singh was from Akhand Kirtani Jatha and did not belong to Bhindranwale. The hijackers were under the leadership of Gajinder Singh who a few years later was nominated as Chairman of the organization while on asylum in Pakistan. The Dal Khalsa activists forced the plane to land in [[Lahore]], Pakistan and demanded the release of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] in addition to demanding the release of all persons who had been detained in connection with the [[Khalistan]] movement, a ransom of 500,000 dollars and compensation of 100,000 Indian Rupees (Rs.) for the families of each Sikhs that had been killed on 20 September 1981, at Chowk Mehta after the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. A day after the hijacking Pakistani commandos arrested the Dal Khalsa activists. The hijackers were identified as Gajinder Singh, Satnam Singh of [[Paonta Sahib]], Jasbir Singh of [[Ropar]], Tejinderpal Singh of [[Jalandhar]] and Karam Singh of [[Jammu]]. Though Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had never openly or officially associated with the Dal Khalsa the organization was largely seen have had close links with him.\n\nIn January 1982, Harsimran Singh, chief organizer of the Dal Khalsa was arrested from [[Mohali]] near [[Chandigarh]]. The Dal Khalsa leaders believed that his arrest was possible due to a conspiracy by some member of the organization. Harsimran Singh was allegedly tortured by the police and was told that they had the permission of the Government to kill him in a fake encounter near the Indo-Pakistan border. Harsimran Singh was forced to read out a written statement if he wanted to save his life.\n\nSometime during April 1982, two cow heads were severed and placed outside two [[Hindu]] temples in [[Amritsar]] by unknown culprits though the police later blamed it on the Dal Khalsa.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\"/> The incident sparked off a small riot in which a large Hindu crowd gathered at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] and began pelting stones at the most sacred place of the Sikhs. Jaswant Singh Thekedar, who at the time was an activist of the Dal Khalsa, was accused of being involved in the incident and was declared a 'Proclaimed Offender' carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him. He fled to the UK via Nepal in 1983 and was expelled from the Dal Khalsa in 1986 for what were said to be 'anti-party' activities by him.\n\nThe Dal Khalsa and [[National Council of Khalistan]] were banned by the Indian government in May, 1982 after which the Dal Khalsa went underground. Two years later, the Dal Khalsa announced its \"Government in Exile\" in June, 1984.\n\nGajinder Singh, one of the plane hijackers of the Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737) in 1981, accepted the post of Chairman of the Dal Khalsa in 1986.\n\n==Revival of Dal Khalsa==\nAfter remaining largely dormant and underground for over a decade the Dal Khalsa was revived in 1998 after the ban on the organisation had lapsed. The revived Dal Khalsa continues to commit to its original objective of establishing an independent [[Khalistan]]. The main office of the Dal Khalsa is presently based in Amritsar at \"Freedom House\", Sarhadi Complex, Railway Road. The Dal Khalsa has since also established units in the United States and the [[Dal Khalsa UK]] in addition to branches across the Punjab state, India. The revived Dal Khalsa has pledged to put aside armed resistance and further the cause of Khalistan by peaceful and democratic means.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the co-founder of the Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh stepped down as Chairman of the organisation. Satnam Singh Paonta, himself one of the original Dal Khalsa founders, was chosen as the new President on 2 October (2005) at a convention held in [[Chandigarh]]. In addition to Satnam Singh Paonta being chosen as the new leader of the Dal Khalsa, the organization welcomed Jaspal Singh Dhillon, head of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Forum]] into the party fold as its new vice President.\n\nThe new senior leadership of the Dal Khalsa had pledged that it will continue to deploy peaceful methods to achieve an independent [[Khalistan]] but will also take up other socio-political issues faced by the people of Punjab such as education for rural children and tackling the menace of [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] abuse. However, the primary objective of the Dal Khalsa would remain the same and that it will not divert from its original and main goal of establishing an independent and sovereign [[Khalistan]].\n\nIn June 2005, the Dal Khalsa became a constituent member of the Punjab Rights Forum.\n\nCurrently H.S. Dhami is the president of Dal Khalsa, and Kanwarpal Singh is the secretary general. Mr Dhami, 58 who hails from Hoshiarpur is industrialist by profession. He did M.S.C in 1975 from DAV College, Jalandhar and it was the writings and revolutionary poetry of Gajinder Singh that inspired him to join the organization in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |title=H S Dhami Is Organization'S New Head |publisher=Dal Khalsa |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071915/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |archive-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2006 the Vice-President of the Dal Khalsa, Jaspal Singh Dhillon, paid a visit to [[London]], UK where he had been invited to attend and deliver a speech on [[Self-determination]] for [[Khalistan]] at the inaugural launch and conference of a new lobby group called [[Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination]] (PNSD) which was held on 11 May at the [[British Parliament]] in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. The Dal Khalsa has sought to work closely with Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination in which the Sikh Nation is one of the founder members.\n\n==Recent activity==\nIn February 2007 the Dal Khalsa broke from its earlier stance regarding the Punjab state legislature by supporting two candidates in the Punjab polls, most notably [[SGPC]] member Karnail Singh Panjoli. During the Punjab legislative assembly elections the Dal Khalsa also supported candidates from the [[Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)]] led by [[Simranjit Singh Mann]].\n\nIn September, 2008, Dal Khalsa named the expatriate Sikh leader [[Manmohan Singh (Sikh separatist)|Manmohan Singh]] vice president.

However, the Indian government made no decision on the demand to declare Amritsar a \"holy city\" which prompted the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Students Federation to organise a procession on 31 May 1981. The [[Hindu]] community was opposed to the demand of declaring Amritsar a \"holy city\" and held their own parallel procession in Amritsar on 29 May 1981.\n\nFor the first time the flag of [[Khalistan]] was hoisted on 1 August 1980, by activists of the Dal Khalsa at the spot in [[Amritsar]] where 13 Sikhs had been killed during a clash with the Nirankaris on 13 April 1978.

The hijackers were under the leadership of Gajinder Singh who a few years later was nominated as Chairman of the organization while on asylum in Pakistan. The Dal Khalsa activists forced the plane to land in [[Lahore]], Pakistan and demanded the release of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] in addition to demanding the release of all persons who had been detained in connection with the [[Khalistan]] movement, a ransom of 500,000 dollars and compensation of 100,000 Indian Rupees (Rs.) for the families of each Sikhs that had been killed on 20 September 1981, at Chowk Mehta after the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. A day after the hijacking Pakistani commandos arrested the Dal Khalsa activists. The hijackers were identified as Gajinder Singh, Satnam Singh of [[Paonta Sahib]], Jasbir Singh of [[Ropar]], Tejinderpal Singh of [[Jalandhar]] and Karam Singh of [[Jammu]]. Though Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had never openly or officially associated with the Dal Khalsa the organization was largely seen have had close links with him.\n\nIn January 1982, Harsimran Singh, chief organizer of the Dal Khalsa was arrested from [[Mohali]] near [[Chandigarh]]. The Dal Khalsa leaders believed that his arrest was possible due to a conspiracy by some member of the organization. Harsimran Singh was allegedly tortured by the police and was told that they had the permission of the Government to kill him in a fake encounter near the Indo-Pakistan border. Harsimran Singh was forced to read out a written statement if he wanted to save his life.\n\nSometime during April 1982, two cow heads were severed and placed outside two [[Hindu]] temples in [[Amritsar]] by unknown culprits though the police later blamed it on the Dal Khalsa.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\"/> The incident sparked off a small riot in which a large Hindu crowd gathered at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] and began pelting stones at the most sacred place of the Sikhs. Jaswant Singh Thekedar, who at the time was an activist of the Dal Khalsa, was accused of being involved in the incident and was declared a 'Proclaimed Offender' carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him. He fled to the UK via Nepal in 1983 and was expelled from the Dal Khalsa in 1986 for what were said to be 'anti-party' activities by him.\n\nThe Dal Khalsa and [[National Council of Khalistan]] were banned by the Indian government in May, 1982 after which the Dal Khalsa went underground. Two years later, the Dal Khalsa announced its \"Government in Exile\" in June, 1984.\n\nGajinder Singh, one of the plane hijackers of the Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737) in 1981, accepted the post of Chairman of the Dal Khalsa in 1986.\n\n==Revival of Dal Khalsa==\nAfter remaining largely dormant and underground for over a decade the Dal Khalsa was revived in 1998 after the ban on the organisation had lapsed. The revived Dal Khalsa continues to commit to its original objective of establishing an independent [[Khalistan]]. The main office of the Dal Khalsa is presently based in Amritsar at \"Freedom House\", Sarhadi Complex, Railway Road. The Dal Khalsa has since also established units in the United States and the [[Dal Khalsa UK]] in addition to branches across the Punjab state, India. The revived Dal Khalsa has pledged to put aside armed resistance and further the cause of Khalistan by peaceful and democratic means.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the co-founder of the Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh stepped down as Chairman of the organisation. Satnam Singh Paonta, himself one of the original Dal Khalsa founders, was chosen as the new President on 2 October (2005) at a convention held in [[Chandigarh]]. In addition to Satnam Singh Paonta being chosen as the new leader of the Dal Khalsa, the organization welcomed Jaspal Singh Dhillon, head of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Forum]] into the party fold as its new vice President.\n\nThe new senior leadership of the Dal Khalsa had pledged that it will continue to deploy peaceful methods to achieve an independent [[Khalistan]] but will also take up other socio-political issues faced by the people of Punjab such as education for rural children and tackling the menace of [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] abuse. However, the primary objective of the Dal Khalsa would remain the same and that it will not divert from its original and main goal of establishing an independent and sovereign [[Khalistan]].\n\nIn June 2005, the Dal Khalsa became a constituent member of the Punjab Rights Forum.\n\nCurrently H.S. Dhami is the president of Dal Khalsa, and Kanwarpal Singh is the secretary general. Mr Dhami, 58 who hails from Hoshiarpur is industrialist by profession. He did M.S.C in 1975 from DAV College, Jalandhar and it was the writings and revolutionary poetry of Gajinder Singh that inspired him to join the organization in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |title=H S Dhami Is Organization'S New Head |publisher=Dal Khalsa |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071915/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |archive-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2006 the Vice-President of the Dal Khalsa, Jaspal Singh Dhillon, paid a visit to [[London]], UK where he had been invited to attend and deliver a speech on [[Self-determination]] for [[Khalistan]] at the inaugural launch and conference of a new lobby group called [[Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination]] (PNSD) which was held on 11 May at the [[British Parliament]] in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. The Dal Khalsa has sought to work closely with Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination in which the Sikh Nation is one of the founder members.\n\n==Recent activity==\nIn February 2007 the Dal Khalsa broke from its earlier stance regarding the Punjab state legislature by supporting two candidates in the Punjab polls, most notably [[SGPC]] member Karnail Singh Panjoli. During the Punjab legislative assembly elections the Dal Khalsa also supported candidates from the [[Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)]] led by [[Simranjit Singh Mann]].\n\nIn September, 2008, Dal Khalsa named the expatriate Sikh leader [[Manmohan Singh (Sikh separatist)|Manmohan Singh]] vice president.  Singh had already been placed on an Indian government blacklist for past militant activities.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080921/punjab1.htm#9\n  |work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]\n  |title=Blacklisted Sikh leader appointed\n  |date=20 September 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 November 2009, marking 25 years of the anti-Sikh massacre following the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi, Dal Khalsa called for Punjab [[Bandh]]. In showing solidarity to the cause, the people of Punjab, regardless of their religion or race, observed complete shutdown in the state to protest against the denial of justice to the aggrieved Sikhs. The bandh was largely peaceful, and the shutdown call had a full backing of other factions like Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panch Pardani), Sikh Youth of Punjab and various factions of Sikh Students Federation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Nov_09/03_Nov_09.html |title=Taksal setting wrong precedent by holding Akand Path of Dasam Granth |publisher=Dal Khalsa |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071911/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Nov_09/03_Nov_09.html |archive-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n  |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091111/punjab.htm#13\n  |title=Sikh leaders to meet UN official today\n  |date=10 November 2009\n  |work=The Tribune\n}}</ref> In November 2009, Kanwarpal Singh and other noted Sikh representatives from various organizations, under the leadership of Justice (retd) Ajit Singh Bains met Ms Shalini Dewan, Director, United Nations Information Centre at New Delhi on 11 November 2009 and urged the UN to intervene in getting justice for victims of November 1984 anti-Sikh carnage.

Addressing the media over there, party head urged Jathedar Avtar Singh Makkar to break the silence and take the lead as it was high time to lay the foundation stone of the memorial as the Sikh Nation is observing the 26th anniversary of Darbar Sahib on 6 June.\n\nStressing on the need to build memorial, he said by raising the memorial in memory of 'martyrs of the faith', the SGPC would not only deliver a sense of pride and fraternity to their families but also goads the Sikhs to relive those times. Also it will be a rebuttal to those, who have been trying to erase this period from public memory.\n\nActivists mostly youngsters from Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr and Moga participated in the sit-in to show their steadfastness towards the cause and also to pay homage to martyrs.\n\nOn the concluding day (6 June) of its 72 hours sit-in protest, the organization vowed to take the June 84 memorial issue to its logical conclusion. H S Dhami said it's a beginning of the struggle. Our aim was to pay tribute to the 'martyrs of faith' and bring the issue of memorial into limelight, which we had succeeded. He said the silence of Akali leadership about memorial to 1984 martyrs even after 26 years of the deadly attack was disgusting and disappointing.\n\nParty's senior most leader Satnam Singh Paonta Sahib ended his 72 hours fast after performing Ardas at Akal Takht by eating karah parshad.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101001180127/http://dalkhalsa.com/ Official site of the Dal Khalsa]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205223243/http://www.dalkhalsausa.org/ Official site of the Dal Khalsa of America]\n\n{{Sikhism}}\n{{India separatist movements}}\n\n[[Category:Khalistan movement]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Typo fixing, replaced: Soverignty \u2192 Sovereignty", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal_Khalsa_(International)"}
