It was released on October 6, 2017 by Well Go USA. It recieved positive reviews from critic, who prasied the cast, acting, theme, and Peckover's direction and screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nAt Christmas time, 17-year-old Ashley is babysitting precocious 12-year-old Luke Lerner. Luke has romantic feelings for Ashley and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her while watching a horror film. Strange happenings outside put Ashley on edge, but it ultimately appears to be just Luke's best friend, Garrett, who has arrived to visit. Hearing a window break upstairs, the trio find a brick inscribed with \"U leave and U die.\" Garrett panics and runs out the back door, but is apparently killed by an unknown shooter.\n\nShocked, Ashley and Luke run upstairs and hide in the attic. Ashley almost breaks her neck from a fall but Luke catches her. After they run into Luke's room and hide in his closet, a masked intruder armed with a shotgun walks in. Ashley recognizes the mask as one of Luke's and yanks it off the intruder, revealing Garrett. Ashley realizes that Luke was hoping to seduce her by scaring her. Angered, Ashley yells at Luke, calling him mental and saying he needs therapy and tries to leave. While at the top of the stairs, Luke hits her with his gun, causing her to fall down the stairs and be knocked unconscious.\n\nLuke binds Ashley with [[duct tape]], forcing her to play [[Truth or dare?|truth or dare]]. Her boyfriend Ricky arrives at the house after receiving a text message sent by Ashley earlier. When Ricky fails to find Ashley, he realizes that something is wrong. Luke tries to knock him out but fails. After nearly killing Luke, Ricky is threatened by Garrett with the shotgun. Luke knocks Ricky out and they tie him up beside Ashley.\n\nWhile Ashley uses a shard of glass to cut herself free, Luke tries to show Garrett what happens if you actually hit someone in the head with a swinging paint can, based on a scene from the film ''[[Home Alone]]''. Luke tries to demonstrate with Ricky but misses on the first swing. Ashley gets free and threatens Luke with a gun. He releases the paint can, which hits and kills Ricky. When Ashley realizes the gun is empty, she tries to escape to a group of carolers outside. Luke uses the brick tossed through the upstairs window to knock her out again before she can alert them. \n\nLuke calls Ashley's ex-boyfriend, Jeremy, claiming that she wants him to write an apology letter. While Jeremy does so, Luke hangs him from a tree, making the apology look like a suicide note. Garrett has a change of heart and starts to free Ashley, but is killed by Luke. Luke stabs Ashley in the neck and stages the scene to frame Jeremy. Later, he goes to bed and waits for the return of his parents, who contact the police. Ashley survives, having placed duct tape over the stab wound to stop the bleeding. Luke watches from his bedroom window as Ashley gives him [[the finger]] before being wheeled into the ambulance.

It was released on October 6, 2017 by Well Go USA.\n\n==Plot==\nAt Christmas time, 17-year-old Ashley is babysitting precocious 12-year-old Luke Lerner. Luke has romantic feelings for Ashley and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her while watching a horror film. Strange happenings outside put Ashley on edge, but it ultimately appears to be just Luke's best friend, Garrett, who has arrived to visit. Hearing a window break upstairs, the trio find a brick inscribed with \"U leave and U die.\" Garrett panics and runs out the back door, but is apparently killed by an unknown shooter.\n\nShocked, Ashley and Luke run upstairs and hide in the attic. Ashley almost breaks her neck from a fall but Luke catches her. After they run into Luke's room and hide in his closet, a masked intruder armed with a shotgun walks in. Ashley recognizes the mask as one of Luke's and yanks it off the intruder, revealing Garrett. Ashley realizes that Luke was hoping to seduce her by scaring her. Angered, Ashley yells at Luke, calling him mental and saying he needs therapy and tries to leave. While at the top of the stairs, Luke hits her with his gun, causing her to fall down the stairs and be knocked unconscious.\n\nLuke binds Ashley with [[duct tape]], forcing her to play [[Truth or dare?|truth or dare]]. Her boyfriend Ricky arrives at the house after receiving a text message sent by Ashley earlier. When Ricky fails to find Ashley, he realizes that something is wrong. Luke tries to knock him out but fails. After nearly killing Luke, Ricky is threatened by Garrett with the shotgun. Luke knocks Ricky out and they tie him up beside Ashley.\n\nWhile Ashley uses a shard of glass to cut herself free, Luke tries to show Garrett what happens if you actually hit someone in the head with a swinging paint can, based on a scene from the film ''[[Home Alone]]''. Luke tries to demonstrate with Ricky but misses on the first swing. Ashley gets free and threatens Luke with a gun. He releases the paint can, which hits and kills Ricky. When Ashley realizes the gun is empty, she tries to escape to a group of carolers outside. Luke uses the brick tossed through the upstairs window to knock her out again before she can alert them. \n\nLuke calls Ashley's ex-boyfriend, Jeremy, claiming that she wants him to write an apology letter. While Jeremy does so, Luke hangs him from a tree, making the apology look like a suicide note. Garrett has a change of heart and starts to free Ashley, but is killed by Luke. Luke stabs Ashley in the neck and stages the scene to frame Jeremy. Later, he goes to bed and waits for the return of his parents, who contact the police. Ashley survives, having placed duct tape over the stab wound to stop the bleeding. Luke watches from his bedroom window as Ashley gives him [[the finger]] before being wheeled into the ambulance. Luke tells his mother that he is \"worried\" about Ashley and wants to visit her at the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Olivia DeJonge]] as Ashley\n* [[Levi Miller]] as Luke Lerner\n* [[Ed Oxenbould]] as Garrett\n* Aleks Mikic as Ricky\n* [[Dacre Montgomery]] as Jeremy\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Robert Lerner\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Deandra Lerner\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] by Well Go USA on December 5, 2017.<ref name=\"homemedia\">{{cite web|title=Better Watch Out (2016) - Chris Peckover|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/better-watch-out-v690440/releases|website=Allmovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n\nOn review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Better Watch Out'' has an approval rating of 89% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.92/10.

Vanderbilt has been a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) since the league's inception in 1932, and has participated in the conference's Eastern Division since its formation for the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 season]]. On November 11, 2012 Vandy became bowl eligible in back to back years for the first time in its 123-year football history. This was the first time since 1935 that Vandy won five SEC games in a year and the first time in 30 years that they won at home against Tennessee. Vanderbilt finished the year with the longest current SEC winning streak. For the first time since 1948, Vanderbilt finished the season with a top 25 ranking.\n\n==Before the season==\nVanderbilt vice chancellor of athletics David Williams announced on February 6, 2012 Vanderbilt will be adding new artificial turf and a new [[JumboTron]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Q-and-A with Vanderbilt's David Williams|first=Jeff|last=Lockridge|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/vanderbilt/tag/artificial-turf/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|location=Nashville|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVice Chancellor Williams confirmed that a large \"berm\" is to be constructed in the open end of Vanderbilt Stadium as a place for fans to watch games starting fall 2012. The project, in addition to other renovations, began after the Black & Gold scrimmage on April 14, 2012. While several ACC stadiums such as [[2012 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]'s  [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] and [[2012 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]'s [[Scott Stadium]]  have hillside seating, Vanderbilt's idea stemmed from the team's 2011 visit to [[2002 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]]'s [[BB&T Field]], which features \"Deacon Hill\" in one end zone.\n\nVanderbilt's is on the line of, but not to the same as Wake Forest. Wake Forest has a natural hill, Vanderbilt's is manmade. Only 500 seats are available, the hillside is a first-come, first-served area in terms of picking a spot to sit. No lounge chairs or coolers are allowed, but fans can bring blankets to place on the grass. The berm will not reach the permanent seating on the sidelines to leave space in the corners of the end zone for fans to enter. The grass on the playing surface will be cut up and relocated to the berm. [[FieldTurf]] is being installed as the new playing surface after April 14, 2012. The JumboTron Vanderbilt is installing in the open end zone that will showcase a significantly larger screen than the one above the closed end zone.\n\nThe fourth major project set for the stadium is improved lighting. Vanderbilt Stadium has the reputation of being one of D1 college football's darker venues for night games. Renovations are ongoing at [[McGugin Center]], where new meeting rooms and Olympic sport locker rooms are being built. The work is due for completion summer 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanderbilt Commodores Plan Hillside Seating in Stadium|first=Jeff|last=Lockridge|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20120405/SPORTS0602/304050041/Vandy-hopes-go-uphill-renovating-stadium|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|location=Nashville|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn July 12, 2012, Vanderbilt announced that vice chancellor David Williams will change his title to vice chancellor for athletes and university affairs and athletics director.

We are complying with SEC and Vanderbilt procedures and are conducting an investigation on the matter.\"\n\nMaryland has believed strongly that O\u2019Brien had been in contact with former Maryland offensive coordinator James Franklin, now Vanderbilt's coach. Under NCAA rules, a school can limit a rival program from having contact with a player without permission: \"A rival school can't encourage a player to transfer without permission. And it can't provide athletics aid in the first academic year if the player transfers without that consent.\"\n\nFranklin has said he keeps relationships with former players but has maintained there was no tampering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Danny O'Brien Transfer: Maryland Officially Files Tampering Charge Against Vanderbilt|first=Samuel|last=Chamberlain|url=http://dc.sbnation.com/maryland-terrapins/2012/2/22/2817183/danny-obrien-transfer-maryland-officially-files-tampering-charge|work=[[SB Nation]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVanderbilt vice chancellor of athletics David Williams said he will be looking thorough and will be conducting an internal investigation into whether football Coach James Franklin or anyone else on his staff was tampering with Maryland players who intend to transfer.

Vanderbilt has been a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) since the league's inception in 1932, and has participated in the conference's Eastern Division since its formation for the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 season]]. On November 11, 2012 Vandy became bowl eligible in back to back years for the first time in its 123-year football history. This was the first time since 1935 that Vandy won five SEC games in a year and the first time in 30 years that they won at home against Tennessee.

The project, in addition to other renovations, began after the Black & Gold scrimmage on April 14, 2012. While several ACC stadiums such as [[2012 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]'s  [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] and [[2012 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]'s [[Scott Stadium]]  have hillside seating, Vanderbilt's idea stemmed from the team's 2011 visit to [[2002 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]]'s [[BB&T Field]], which features \"Deacon Hill\" in one end zone.\n\nVanderbilt's is on the line of, but not to the same as Wake Forest. Wake Forest has a natural hill, Vanderbilt's is manmade. Only 500 seats are available, the hillside is a first-come, first-served area in terms of picking a spot to sit. No lounge chairs or coolers are allowed, but fans can bring blankets to place on the grass. The berm will not reach the permanent seating on the sidelines to leave space in the corners of the end zone for fans to enter. The grass on the playing surface will be cut up and relocated to the berm. [[FieldTurf]] is being installed as the new playing surface after April 14, 2012. The JumboTron Vanderbilt is installing in the open end zone that will showcase a significantly larger screen than the one above the closed end zone.\n\nThe fourth major project set for the stadium is improved lighting. Vanderbilt Stadium has the reputation of being one of D1 college football's darker venues for night games.

For 2002, the M\u00e9gane entered its second generation with a substantial redesign taking place, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]] for 2003, whilst also becoming the first car in its class to receive a five star [[EuroNCAP]] rating.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane entered its third generation in 2008, with another totally different design being used; the saloon version of the M\u00e9gane became known as the [[Renault Fluence]] for this generation, and it was introduced in 2009.

Very quickly, several themes were outlined and developed into four small scale (1/5) models by September 1990.\n\nThe designs retained were developed around four themes. Theme A: a six light version, evoking the Laguna; Theme B: a model with a markedly cuneiform line; Theme C: another design with ellipse shaped glasswork and rear notch; Theme D: a model with the same elliptical glazing and rounded rear.\n\nIn March 1991, all four styling proposals were developed into full scale (1:1). Theme C by Michel Jardin was chosen by Le Quement and frozen for production in April 1992. The first prototypes were built and presented to management in December 1992. Approximately 432 prototypes were built (at Rueil assembly) and destroyed during development.\n\nIn June 1993, Renault purchased production tooling for the X64, with the first test unit being assembled at the Douai plant in October 1994, and pre production units being constructed from December 1994 to the middle of 1995.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane I was unveiled in September 1995, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]], as a replacement for the [[Renault 19]]. The car was essentially a reskin of its predecessor, and carried over the 19's floorpan, engines, transmissions and chassis design, albeit with much modification.\n\nTaking its name from a Renault concept car shown in 1988, the M\u00e9gane further developed the new corporate styling theme introduced by Patrick Le Qu\u00e9ment on the [[Renault Laguna|Laguna]], most notably the \"bird beak\" front grille \u2013 a styling cue borrowed from the [[Renault 16]] of the 1960s.\n\nAs with the 19 and the [[Renault 9/11|11]] before it, the M\u00e9gane was produced at Renault's [[Douai]] plant in northern France starting in July 1995, and at the Spanish plant of [[Palencia]]. Market launch began on 15 November 1995 in France, and 15 December 1995 for the coup\u00e9. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 1996.\n\nSafety was a key focus of the M\u00e9gane I, Renault's first car reflecting their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar mounted three point seatbelt for the middle rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} safety structure \u2013 a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995.\n\nSome features, such as the three point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the M\u00e9gane).\n\nThe car also benefited from Renault's first \"System for Restraint and Protection\" (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, load limiter and airbag. The M\u00e9gane I achieved a best in class four star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by [[Euro NCAP]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Renault Megane (1998) |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/ratings-rewards/latest-safety-ratings/en/results/renault/megane/18372 |title=Renault Megane (1998) |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nNovember 1996 saw the introduction of the [[Renault M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic|M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic]] [[compact MPV]].\n\nPower came from the Renault E type (\"Energy\") engine in 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L, and the F-type unit in both 1.9&nbsp;L diesel and 2.0&nbsp;L petrol forms, although this time around there was a wider variety of 16 valve derivatives. A 1.9&nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharged]] forms was also available.\n\nRenault also produced a limited number of Renaultsport edition Phase 1's with the Renaultsport bodywork; however, these were very rare. The Renaultsport kit was available to purchase for a short time direct from Renault France, but has now been discontinued, thus their value has increased.\n\nThe [[station wagon|estate]] version of the original M\u00e9gane was only available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] form, with no [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] variants being built, this could be due to the greater popularity of the Scenic in those markets. It was added with the facelift of 1999.\n\nIn Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], but in 1999 Renault acquired a stake in Japanese automaker [[Nissan]]. As a result of Renault's purchase, Yanase canceled its licensing contract for all Renault models sold in Japan, including, but not limited to, the M\u00e9gane I, in 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee for Renault cars.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Facelift===\nA mild facelift in spring 1999 gave the M\u00e9gane I a modified grille, more advanced safety features and upgraded equipment, and [[multi-valve|16 valve]] engines were used across the range. An Estate body style was also launched in mainland Europe with the facelift. The production continued for the Latin America Market, where it was sold alongside the M\u00e9gane II line at a considerably lower price until 2011.\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:2002 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.6 Front.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:2001 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.4.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:Renault Megane Coupe 1.6 16v 2000 (15037225005).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane coup\u00e9\nFile:Renault Megane Cupe (1).jpg|Renault M\u00e9gane Coup\u00e9 (Restyling)\nFile:2003 Renault M\u00e9gane (X64) Privilege convertible (20889553963).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane convertible\nFile:Renault M\u00e9gane I Phase II Grandtour 1.4 16V Fairway Heck.JPG|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane estate\n</gallery>\n\n===South America===\nIn countries such as Argentina and Colombia the M\u00e9gane I was available until 2010 sold as a sedan and an Estate, but in Venezuela was available only as a sedan. It features as the top line of the model the LA04 engine (16 valves, 1.6 litres and 110 HP), and was produced by both Renault Colombia and Renault Argentina, in where it was one of the best selling cars to date.\n\nIt is a car with more advanced safety features, upgraded equipment and more. The M\u00e9gane I had a lower price than the M\u00e9gane II.\n\nIn Venezuela, it was only available in one version: Unique, with a five speed manual gearbox or a four speed automatic one. Both of these were equipped with Abs and other extra equipment including driver and passenger front airbags, foglights, leather seats, electric mirrors and electric windows. In Argentina, not every version had features such as electric windows, electric mirrors or airbags.\n\n===Engines===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"\n!

This was the [[Clio Williams Maxi]], which was the first car truly developed for the F2 Kit Car category, and first appeared in 1996. However, rivals such as [[Citro\u00ebn]] and [[Peugeot]] soon introduced bigger and more powerful cars, which resulted in Renault producing an F2 version of the M\u00e9gane in 1996.

For 2002, the M\u00e9gane entered its second generation with a substantial redesign taking place, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]] for 2003, whilst also becoming the first car in its class to receive a five star [[EuroNCAP]] rating.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane entered its third generation in 2008, with another totally different design being used; the saloon version of the M\u00e9gane became known as the [[Renault Fluence]] for this generation, and it was introduced in 2009.

Very quickly, several themes were outlined and developed into four small scale (1/5) models by September 1990.\n\nThe designs retained were developed around four themes. Theme A: a six light version, evoking the Laguna; Theme B: a model with a markedly cuneiform line; Theme C: another design with ellipse shaped glasswork and rear notch; Theme D: a model with the same elliptical glazing and rounded rear.\n\nIn March 1991, all four styling proposals were developed into full scale (1:1). Theme C by Michel Jardin was chosen by Le Quement and frozen for production in April 1992. The first prototypes were built and presented to management in December 1992. Approximately 432 prototypes were built (at Rueil assembly) and destroyed during development.\n\nIn June 1993, Renault purchased production tooling for the X64, with the first test unit being assembled at the Douai plant in October 1994, and pre production units being constructed from December 1994 to the middle of 1995.\n\nThe M\u00e9gane I was unveiled in September 1995, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]], as a replacement for the [[Renault 19]]. The car was essentially a reskin of its predecessor, and carried over the 19's floorpan, engines, transmissions and chassis design, albeit with much modification.\n\nTaking its name from a Renault concept car shown in 1988, the M\u00e9gane further developed the new corporate styling theme introduced by Patrick Le Qu\u00e9ment on the [[Renault Laguna|Laguna]], most notably the \"bird beak\" front grille \u2013 a styling cue borrowed from the [[Renault 16]] of the 1960s.\n\nAs with the 19 and the [[Renault 9/11|11]] before it, the M\u00e9gane was produced at Renault's [[Douai]] plant in northern France starting in July 1995, and at the Spanish plant of [[Palencia]]. Market launch began on 15 November 1995 in France, and 15 December 1995 for the coup\u00e9. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 1996.\n\nSafety was a key focus of the M\u00e9gane I, Renault's first car reflecting their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar mounted three point seatbelt for the middle rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} safety structure \u2013 a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995.\n\nSome features, such as the three point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the M\u00e9gane).\n\nThe car also benefited from Renault's first \"System for Restraint and Protection\" (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, load limiter and airbag. The M\u00e9gane I achieved a best in class four star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by [[Euro NCAP]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Renault Megane (1998) |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/ratings-rewards/latest-safety-ratings/en/results/renault/megane/18372 |title=Renault Megane (1998) |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nNovember 1996 saw the introduction of the [[Renault M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic|M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic]] [[compact MPV]].\n\nPower came from the Renault E type (\"Energy\") engine in 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L, and the F-type unit in both 1.9&nbsp;L diesel and 2.0&nbsp;L petrol forms, although this time around there was a wider variety of 16 valve derivatives. A 1.9&nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharged]] forms was also available.\n\nRenault also produced a limited number of Renaultsport edition Phase 1's with the Renaultsport bodywork; however, these were very rare. The Renaultsport kit was available to purchase for a short time direct from Renault France, but has now been discontinued, thus their value has increased.\n\nThe [[station wagon|estate]] version of the original M\u00e9gane was only available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] form, with no [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] variants being built, this could be due to the greater popularity of the Scenic in those markets. It was added with the facelift of 1999.\n\nIn Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], but in 1999 Renault acquired a stake in Japanese automaker [[Nissan]]. As a result of Renault's purchase, Yanase canceled its licensing contract for all Renault models sold in Japan, including, but not limited to, the M\u00e9gane I, in 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee for Renault cars.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Facelift===\nA mild facelift in spring 1999 gave the M\u00e9gane I a modified grille, more advanced safety features and upgraded equipment, and [[multi-valve|16 valve]] engines were used across the range. An Estate body style was also launched in mainland Europe with the facelift. The production continued for the Latin America Market, where it was sold alongside the M\u00e9gane II line at a considerably lower price until 2011.\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:2002 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.6 Front.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:2001 Renault Megane Fidji 16V 1.4.jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane five door hatchback\nFile:Renault Megane Coupe 1.6 16v 2000 (15037225005).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane coup\u00e9\nFile:Renault Megane Cupe (1).jpg|Renault M\u00e9gane Coup\u00e9 (Restyling)\nFile:2003 Renault M\u00e9gane (X64) Privilege convertible (20889553963).jpg|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane convertible\nFile:Renault M\u00e9gane I Phase II Grandtour 1.4 16V Fairway Heck.JPG|Post facelift Renault M\u00e9gane estate\n</gallery>\n\n===South America===\nIn countries such as Argentina and Colombia the M\u00e9gane I was available until 2010 sold as a sedan and an Estate, but in Venezuela was available only as a sedan. It features as the top line of the model the LA04 engine (16 valves, 1.6 litres and 110 HP), and was produced by both Renault Colombia and Renault Argentina, in where it was one of the best selling cars to date.\n\nIt is a car with more advanced safety features, upgraded equipment and more. The M\u00e9gane I had a lower price than the M\u00e9gane II.\n\nIn Venezuela, it was only available in one version: Unique, with a five speed manual gearbox or a four speed automatic one. Both of these were equipped with Abs and other extra equipment including driver and passenger front airbags, foglights, leather seats, electric mirrors and electric windows. In Argentina, not every version had features such as electric windows, electric mirrors or airbags.\n\n===Engines===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"\n!

This was the [[Clio Williams Maxi]], which was the first car truly developed for the F2 Kit Car category, and first appeared in 1996. However, rivals such as [[Citro\u00ebn]] and [[Peugeot]] soon introduced bigger and more powerful cars, which resulted in Renault producing an F2 version of the M\u00e9gane in 1996.
