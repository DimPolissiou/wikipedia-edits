Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

The Apple I computer differed from the other kit-style hobby computers of era. At the request of [[Paul Terrell]], owner of the [[Byte Shop]], Jobs and Wozniak were given their first purchase order, for 50 Apple I computers, only if the computers were assembled and tested and not a kit computer. Terrell wanted to have computers to sell to a wide range of users, not just experienced electronics hobbyists who had the soldering skills to assemble a computer kit. The [[Apple I]] as delivered was still technically a kit computer, as it did not have a power supply, case, or keyboard when it was delivered to the Byte Shop.\n[[File:Trinity77.jpg|thumb|412x412px|The three personal computers referred to by Byte Magazine as the \"1977 Trinity\" of home computing: The Commodore PET, the Apple II, and the TRS-80 Model I.]]\nThe first successfully mass marketed personal computer to be announced was the [[Commodore PET]] after being revealed in January 1977.

Together, these 3 machines were referred to as the \"1977 trinity\". Mass-market, ready-assembled computers had arrived, and allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.\n\nIn 1977 the Heath company introduced personal computer kits known as [[Heathkit]]s, starting with the [[Heathkit H8]], followed by the Heathkit H89 in late 1979. With the purchase of the Heathkit H8 you would obtain the chassis and CPU card to assemble yourself, additional hardware such as the H8-1 memory board that contained 4k of RAM could also be purchased in order to run software. The Heathkit H11 model was released in 1978 and was one of the first 16-bit personal computers, however due to its high retail cost of $1,295 was discontinued in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/hp/hk/heathkit.htm|title=Joe's Heathkit Computer Catalog Page|website=www.classiccmp.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vintagecomputer.com/heathkit-h8.html|title=Heathkit H8|website=vintagecomputer.com|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/heathkit-h89.html|title=Heathkit H89 computer|website=oldcomputers.net|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IBM PC 5150.jpg|thumb|[[IBM 5150]], released in 1981]]\n[[File:PMD 85-1.jpg|thumb|The 8-bit [[PMD 85]] personal computer produced in 1985\u20131990 by the [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|Tesla]] company in the former socialist [[Czechoslovakia]]]]\n\nDuring the early 1980s, [[home computer]]s were further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display, with low-detail blocky graphics and a limited color range, and text about 40 characters wide by 25 characters tall.

The Amiga 1000 featured a multitasking, windowing operating system, color graphics with a 4096-color palette, stereo sound, Motorola 68000 CPU, 256&nbsp;KB RAM, and 880&nbsp;KB 3.5-inch disk drive, for US$1,295.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polsson|first=Ken|title=Chronology of Amiga Computers|url=http://pctimeline.info/amiga/|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSomewhat larger and more expensive systems were aimed at office and small business use. These often featured 80-column text displays but might not have had graphics or sound capabilities. These microprocessor based systems were still less costly than time-shared mainframes or minicomputers.\n\n[[Workstation]]s were characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large-capacity local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking operating system]]. Eventually, due to the [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.\n\nIBM's first PC was introduced Aug. 12, 1981.<ref>{{cite newspaper  \n   |newspaper=[[Information Week]] |date=August 5, 1991\n   |title=A Decade of Personal Computing\n   |page=24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982 \"The Computer\" was named [[Time Person of the Year|Machine of the Year]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. In the 2010s, several companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony sold off their PC and laptop divisions.

Experimental public access to a shared mainframe computer system was demonstrated as early as 1973 in the [[Community Memory]] project, but [[bulletin board system]]s and [[online service provider]]s became more commonly available after 1978. Commercial [[Internet]] service providers emerged in the last 1980's, giving public access to the rapidly growing network.\n\nIn 1991, the [[World Wide Web]] was made available for public use. The combination of powerful personal computers with high resolution graphics and sound, with the infrastructure provided by the Internet, and the standardization of access methods of the [[Web browser]]s, established the foundation for a significant fraction of modern life, from bus time tables through unlimited distribution of free [[pornography]] through to online user-edited encyclopedias.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Stationary ===\n\n==== Workstation ====\n[[File:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|Sun [[SPARCstation]]&nbsp;1+ from the early 1990s, with a 25&nbsp;MHz [[RISC]] processor]] {{Main|Workstation}}\n\nA workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical, mathematical, or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to a [[local area network]] and run multi-user [[operating system]]s.

More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style of [[computer case]]. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical [[tower case]]s to small models which can be tucked behind or rest directly beneath (and support) [[LCD monitor]]s.\n\nWhile the term \"desktop\" often refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computer [[tower case]], these varieties usually rest on the ground or underneath desks. Despite this seeming contradiction, the term \"desktop\" does typically refer to these vertical tower cases as well as the horizontally aligned models which are designed to literally rest on top of desks and are therefore more appropriate to the \"desktop\" term, although both types qualify for this \"desktop\" label in most practical situations aside from certain physical arrangement differences. Both styles of these computer cases hold the systems hardware components such as the motherboard, processor chip, other internal operating parts. Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and an external keyboard, which are plugged into USB ports on the back of the computer case. Desktop computers are popular for home and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk for [[Multi-monitor|multiple monitors]].\n\nA [[gaming computer]] is a desktop computer that generally comprises a high-performance [[video card]], processor and memory, to improve the speed and responsiveness of demanding [[PC game|video games]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Andy |title=Evolution of Custom Gaming PCs: What Really Made the Difference |url=http://www.digitalstorm.com/unlocked/evolution-of-custom-gaming-pcs-what-really-made-the-difference-idnum20/ |website=digitalstorm.com |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn [[all-in-one computer]] (also known as single-unit PCs) is a desktop computer that combines the monitor and processor within a single unit. A separate keyboard and mouse are standard input devices, with some monitors including [[touchscreen]] capability. The processor and other working components are typically reduced in size relative to standard desktops, located behind the monitor, and configured similarly to laptops.\n\nA [[Nettop (computer)|nettops]] computer was introduced by [[Intel]] in February 2008, characterized by low cost and lean functionality. These were intended to be used with an Internet connection to run [[World Wide Web|Web]] browsers and Internet applications.\n\n[[File:Home theater PC front with keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Antec]] Fusion V2 [[home theater PC]], with a keyboard placed on top of it]]\n\nA [[Home theater PC]] (HTPC) combines the functions of a personal computer and a [[digital video recorder]]. It is connected to a [[TV set]] or an appropriately sized [[computer display]], and is often used as a digital photo viewer, music and video player, TV receiver, and digital video recorder. HTPCs are also referred to as media center systems or [[media server]]s. The goal is to combine many or all components of a [[home cinema|home theater]] setup into one box.  HTPCs can also connect to services providing on-demand movies and TV shows. HTPCs can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be assembled from components.\n\n=== Portable ===\nThe potential utility of portable computers was apparent early on.  [[Alan Kay]] described the [[Dynabook]] in 1972, but no hardware was developed.  The [[Xerox NoteTaker]] was produced in a very small experimental batch around 1978. In 1975, the [[IBM 5100]] could be fit into a transport case, making it a portable computer, but it weighed about 50 pounds.\n\nBefore the introduction of the IBM PC, portable computers consisting of a processor, display, disk drives and keyboard, in a suit-case style portable housing, allowed users to bring a computer home from the office or to take notes at a classroom. Examples include the [[Osborne 1]] and [[Kaypro]]; and the [[Commodore SX-64]].  These machines were AC powered and included a small CRT display screen. The form factor was intended to allow these systems to be taken on board an airplane as carry-on baggage, though their high power demand meant that they could not be used in flight. The integrated CRT display made for a relatively heavy package, but these machines were more portable than their contemporary desktop equals. Some models had standard or optional connections to drive an external video monitor, allowing a larger screen or use with video projectors.\n\nIBM PC-compatible suitcase format computers became available soon after the introduction of the PC, with the [[Compaq Portable]] being a leading example of the type. Later models included a [[hard drive]] to give roughly equivalent performance to contemporary desk top computers.\n\nThe development of thin plasma display and LCD screens permitted a somewhat smaller form factor, called the \"lunchbox\" computer. The screen formed one side of the enclosure, with a detachable keyboard and one or two half-height floppy disk drives, mounted facing the ends of the computer.  Some variations included a battery, allowing operation away from AC outlets.<ref name=\"SM04\">Scott Mueller, ''Upgrading and Repairing Laptops'', Que Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|0789728001}}, pp. 18\u201321</ref>\n\nNotebook computers such as the [[TRS-80 Model 100]] and [[Epson HX-20]] had roughly the plan dimensions of a sheet of typing paper ([[Paper size|ANSI A or ISO A4]]). These machines had a keyboard with slightly reduced dimensions compared to a desktop system, and a fixed LCD display screen coplanar with the keyboard.  These displays were usually small, with 8 to 16 lines of text, sometimes only 40 columns line length.  However, these machines could operate for extended times on disposable or rechargeable batteries. Although they did not usually include internal disk drives, this form factor often included a [[modem]] for telephone communication and often had provisions for external cassette or disk storage. Later, clam-shell format laptop computers with similar small plan dimensions were also called \"notebooks\".\n\n==== Laptop ====\n{{Main|Laptop}}\n[[File:MSI laptop with English Wikipedia screenshot 20100614.jpg|thumb|A laptop computer]]\n\nA [[laptop]] computer is designed for portability with \"[[Flip (form)|clamshell]]\" design, where the keyboard and computer components are on one panel, with a hinged second panel containing a flat display screen. Closing the laptop protects the screen and keyboard during transportation.  Laptops generally have a rechargeable [[battery (electricity)|battery]], enhancing their portability.  To save power, weight and space, laptop graphics cards are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to a desktop machine. For this reason, desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops for [[Video game|gaming]] purposes.\n \nUnlike desktop computers, only minor internal upgrades (such as memory and hard disk drive) are feasible owing to the limited space and power available. Laptops have the same input and output ports as desktops, for connecting to external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards. Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops, as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive.\n\n[[File:Acer aspire 4930G.jpg|thumb|An Acer Aspire desktop replacement laptop]]\n\nA [[desktop replacement computer]] is a portable computer that provides the full capabilities of a [[desktop computer]]. Such computers are currently large laptops. This class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers, and may have limited battery capacity or no battery.<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html Desktop notebooks stake their claim], accessed October 19, 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:HP 2133 Mini-Note PC (front view compare with pencil).jpg|thumb|An [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[netbook]] ]]\n\n[[Netbook]]s, also called mini notebooks or [[subnotebook]]s, were a subgroup of laptops<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-pc-was-supposed-to-die-a-decade-ago-instead-this-happened/|title=The PC was supposed to die a decade ago.

Microsoft-compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons like [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]], [[barcode]] readers, [[RFID]] readers and cameras. In 2007, with the release of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme: devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC, while devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional.<ref>[http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/jun07/newwmdev.aspx New Windows Mobile 6 Devices :: Jun/Jul 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304084831/http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/jun07/newwmdev.aspx |date=March 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Personal computer, exploded 6.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[exploded view]] of a personal computer and peripherals (some of which are optional):\n{{Ordered list\n|[[Image scanner|Scanner]]\n|[[Central processing unit|CPU]] ([[microprocessor]])\n|[[Computer memory|Memory]] ([[Random access memory|RAM]])|[[Expansion card]]s ([[graphics card]]s, etc.)\n\n|[[Power supply unit (computer)|Power supply]]\n|[[Optical disc]] drive\n|[[Storage (memory)|Storage]] ([[hard disk]] or [[SSD]])\n|[[Motherboard]]\n|[[Loudspeaker|Speakers]]\n|[[Computer display|Monitor]]\n|[[System software]]\n|[[Application software]]\n|[[Computer keyboard|Keyboard]]\n|[[Computer mouse|Mouse]]\n|[[External hard disk drive|External hard disk]]\n|[[Computer printer|Printer]]\n}}]]\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n\n[[Computer hardware]] is a comprehensive term for all physical and tangible parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. Some sub-systems of a personal computer may contain processors that run a fixed program, or [[firmware]], such as a keyboard controller. Firmware usually is not changed by the end user of the personal computer.\n\nMost 2010s-era computers only require users to plug in the power supply, monitor, and other cables. A typical [[desktop computer]] consists of a [[computer case]] (or \"tower\"), a metal chassis that holds the [[Computer power supply|power supply]], [[motherboard]], [[hard disk drive]], and often an [[optical disc drive]]. Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components. External devices such as a [[computer monitor]] or [[visual display unit]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], and a [[pointing device]] ([[Computer mouse|mouse]]) are usually found in a personal computer.\n\nThe [[motherboard]] connects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. The [[RAM]], graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard. The [[central processing unit]] (microprocessor chip) plugs into a [[CPU socket]], while the memory modules plug into corresponding memory sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard, while others use [[expansion slot]]s for graphics cards, network cards, or other [[Input/output|I/O]] devices.  The graphics card or sound card may employ a [[break out box]] to keep the analog parts away from the [[electromagnetic radiation]] inside the computer case. Disk drives, which provide mass storage, are connected to the motherboard with one cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually, disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage.\n\nFor large amounts of data, a [[tape drive]] can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case. The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer case. The monitor is also connected to the input/output (I/O) panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card. Capabilities of the personal computers hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition of [[expansion card]]s connected via an expansion [[computer bus|bus]]. Standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers include [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], [[PCI Express]] (PCIe), and [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] (a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters, found in older computers). Most modern personal computers have multiple physical PCI Express expansion slots, with some having PCI slots as well.\n\nA [[peripheral]] is \"a device connected to a computer to provide communication (such as input and output) or auxiliary functions (such as additional storage)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peripheral|title=Definition of PERIPHERAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> Peripherals generally connect to the computer through the use of USB ports or inputs located on the I/O panel. USB [[USB flash drive|Flash Drives]] provide portable storage using flash memory which allows users to access the files stored on the drive on any computer. [[Memory card]]s also provide portable storage for users, commonly used on other electronics such as mobile phones and digital cameras, the information stored on these cards can be accessed using a memory card reader to transfer data between devices. Webcams, which are either built into computer hardware or connected via USB are video cameras that records video in real time to either be saved to the computer or streamed somewhere else over the internet. [[Game controller]]s can be plugged in via USB and can be used as an input device for video games as an alternative to using keyboard and mouse. [[Headphones]] and speakers can be connected via USB or through an auxiliary port (found on I/O panel)  and allow users to listen to audio accessed on their computer, however speakers may also require an additional power source to operate. [[Microphone]]s can be connected through an audio input port on the I/O panel and allow the computer to convert sound into an electrical signal to be used or transmitted by the computer.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main|Computer software}}\n[[File:LibreOffice 6.0.6.2 Writer.png|alt=|thumb|A screenshot of the [[LibreOffice Writer]] software]]\nComputer software is any kind of [[computer program]], [[Algorithm|procedure]], or documentation that performs some task on a computer system.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0\n| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ\n| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software\n| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> The term includes [[application software]] such as [[word processor]]s that perform productive tasks for users, [[system software]] such as [[operating system]]s that interface with [[computer hardware]] to provide the necessary services for application software, and [[middleware]] that controls and co-ordinates [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]].\n[[File:GIMP 2.10.jpg|alt=|thumb|A screenshot of [[GIMP]], which is a [[raster graphics editor]].]]\nSoftware applications are common for [[word processing]], [[Internet]] browsing, [[Internet fax]]ing, [[e-mail]] and other digital messaging, [[multimedia]] playback, playing of [[computer game]], and [[computer programming]]. The user may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, most [[software]] written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, or \"[[usability|user-friendliness]]\" in mind. However, the [[software industry]] continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.\n\n=== Operating system ===\n{{Main|Operating system}}{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}\n\nAn operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with an [[User interface|interface]] used to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating [[Computer data storage|memory]], prioritizing system requests, controlling [[input/output|input and output]] devices, facilitating [[computer networking]], and managing files.\n\nCommon contemporary desktop operating systems are [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[FreeBSD]]. Windows, macOS, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of them were inspired by or directly inherited from the [[Unix]] operating system.\n\nEarly personal computers used operating systems that supported [[command line]] interaction, using an alphanumeric display and keyboard. The user had to remember a large range of commands to, for example, open a file for editing or to move text from one place to another. Starting in the early 1960s, the advantages of a [[graphical user interface]] began to be explored, but widespread adoption required lower cost graphical display equipment. By 1984, mass-market computer systems using graphical user interfaces were available; by the turn of the 21st century, text-mode operating systems were no longer a significant fraction of the personal computer market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/gui.html|title=GUI Definition|website=www.linfo.org|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Applications ===\n{{Main|Application software}}\nGenerally, a computer user uses application software to carry out a specific task.<ref name=\"Weik 2000\">{{Cite book|title=Computer Science and Communications Dictionary|last=Weik|first=Martin|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7923-8425-0|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}</ref> [[System software]] supports applications<ref name=\"Weik 2000\"/> and provides common services such as memory management, network connectivity and device drivers, all of which may be used by applications but are not directly of interest to the end user. A simplified [[analogy]] in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb (an application) to an electric power generation plant (a system):<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/application_software.htm|title=Application software|website=ScienceDaily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430094836/http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/application_software.htm|archive-date=2015-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> the power plant merely generates electricity, not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user.\n\nTypical examples of software applications are [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s, and [[media player (application software)|media players]]. Multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as an ''application suite''. [[Microsoft Office]] and [[LibreOffice]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kinematic Labs with Mobile Devices|journal=Kinematic Labs with Mobile Devices|last=Kinser|first=Jason|publisher=Morgan and Claypool|year=2015|isbn=978-1-6270-5627-4|location=|pages=|bibcode=2015klmd.book.....K|doi=10.1088/978-1-6270-5628-1}}</ref> which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several other discrete applications, are typical examples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garrison|first=Bruce|date=1999|title=Microsoft Office 2000 software suite|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&sid=1cabdc8f-1ea0-48a7-879e-072fb3ccd840%40sessionmgr4010|journal=World Communication|volume=|pages=105|via=Ebscohost}}</ref> The separate applications in a suite usually have a [[user interface]] that has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application. Often, they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user; for example, a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application.\n\n[[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software include spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts; even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.\n\n=== Gaming ===\n[[PC gaming]] is popular among the high-end PC market. According to an April 2018 market analysis done by Newzoo, PC gaming has fallen behind both console and mobile gaming in terms of market share sitting at a 24% share of the entire market.

The Heathkit H11 model was released in 1978 and was one of the first 16-bit personal computers, however due to its high retail cost of $1,295 was discontinued in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/hp/hk/heathkit.htm|title=Joe's Heathkit Computer Catalog Page|website=www.classiccmp.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vintagecomputer.com/heathkit-h8.html|title=Heathkit H8|website=vintagecomputer.com|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/heathkit-h89.html|title=Heathkit H89 computer|website=oldcomputers.net|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IBM PC 5150.jpg|thumb|[[IBM 5150]], released in 1981]]\n[[File:PMD 85-1.jpg|thumb|The 8-bit [[PMD 85]] personal computer produced in 1985\u20131990 by the [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|Tesla]] company in the former socialist [[Czechoslovakia]]]]\n\nDuring the early 1980s, [[home computer]]s were further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display, with low-detail blocky graphics and a limited color range, and text about 40 characters wide by 25 characters tall.

These often featured 80-column text displays but might not have had graphics or sound capabilities. These microprocessor based systems were still less costly than time-shared mainframes or minicomputers.\n\n[[Workstation]]s were characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large-capacity local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking operating system]]. Eventually, due to the [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.\n\nIBM's first PC was introduced Aug. 12, 1981.<ref>{{cite newspaper  \n   |newspaper=[[Information Week]] |date=August 5, 1991\n   |title=A Decade of Personal Computing\n   |page=24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982 \"The Computer\" was named [[Time Person of the Year|Machine of the Year]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

Experimental public access to a shared mainframe computer system was demonstrated as early as 1973 in the [[Community Memory]] project, but [[bulletin board system]]s and [[online service provider]]s became more commonly available after 1978. Commercial [[Internet]] service providers emerged in the last 1980's, giving public access to the rapidly growing network.\n\nIn 1991, the [[World Wide Web]] was made available for public use. The combination of powerful personal computers with high resolution graphics and sound, with the infrastructure provided by the Internet, and the standardization of access methods of the [[Web browser]]s, established the foundation for a significant fraction of modern life, from bus time tables through unlimited distribution of free [[pornography]] through to online user-edited encyclopedias.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Stationary ===\n\n==== Workstation ====\n[[File:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|Sun [[SPARCstation]]&nbsp;1+ from the early 1990s, with a 25&nbsp;MHz [[RISC]] processor]] {{Main|Workstation}}\n\nA workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical, mathematical, or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to a [[local area network]] and run multi-user [[operating system]]s.

More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style of [[computer case]]. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical [[tower case]]s to small models which can be tucked behind or rest directly beneath (and support) [[LCD monitor]]s.\n\nWhile the term \"desktop\" often refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computer [[tower case]], these varieties usually rest on the ground or underneath desks. Despite this seeming contradiction, the term \"desktop\" does typically refer to these vertical tower cases as well as the horizontally aligned models which are designed to literally rest on top of desks and are therefore more appropriate to the \"desktop\" term, although both types qualify for this \"desktop\" label in most practical situations aside from certain physical arrangement differences. Both styles of these computer cases hold the systems hardware components such as the motherboard, processor chip, other internal operating parts. Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and an external keyboard, which are plugged into USB ports on the back of the computer case. Desktop computers are popular for home and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk for [[Multi-monitor|multiple monitors]].\n\nA [[gaming computer]] is a desktop computer that generally comprises a high-performance [[video card]], processor and memory, to improve the speed and responsiveness of demanding [[PC game|video games]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Andy |title=Evolution of Custom Gaming PCs: What Really Made the Difference |url=http://www.digitalstorm.com/unlocked/evolution-of-custom-gaming-pcs-what-really-made-the-difference-idnum20/ |website=digitalstorm.com |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn [[all-in-one computer]] (also known as single-unit PCs) is a desktop computer that combines the monitor and processor within a single unit. A separate keyboard and mouse are standard input devices, with some monitors including [[touchscreen]] capability. The processor and other working components are typically reduced in size relative to standard desktops, located behind the monitor, and configured similarly to laptops.\n\nA [[Nettop (computer)|nettops]] computer was introduced by [[Intel]] in February 2008, characterized by low cost and lean functionality. These were intended to be used with an Internet connection to run [[World Wide Web|Web]] browsers and Internet applications.\n\n[[File:Home theater PC front with keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Antec]] Fusion V2 [[home theater PC]], with a keyboard placed on top of it]]\n\nA [[Home theater PC]] (HTPC) combines the functions of a personal computer and a [[digital video recorder]]. It is connected to a [[TV set]] or an appropriately sized [[computer display]], and is often used as a digital photo viewer, music and video player, TV receiver, and digital video recorder. HTPCs are also referred to as media center systems or [[media server]]s. The goal is to combine many or all components of a [[home cinema|home theater]] setup into one box.  HTPCs can also connect to services providing on-demand movies and TV shows. HTPCs can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be assembled from components.\n\n=== Portable ===\nThe potential utility of portable computers was apparent early on.  [[Alan Kay]] described the [[Dynabook]] in 1972, but no hardware was developed.  The [[Xerox NoteTaker]] was produced in a very small experimental batch around 1978. In 1975, the [[IBM 5100]] could be fit into a transport case, making it a portable computer, but it weighed about 50 pounds.\n\nBefore the introduction of the IBM PC, portable computers consisting of a processor, display, disk drives and keyboard, in a suit-case style portable housing, allowed users to bring a computer home from the office or to take notes at a classroom. Examples include the [[Osborne 1]] and [[Kaypro]]; and the [[Commodore SX-64]].  These machines were AC powered and included a small CRT display screen. The form factor was intended to allow these systems to be taken on board an airplane as carry-on baggage, though their high power demand meant that they could not be used in flight. The integrated CRT display made for a relatively heavy package, but these machines were more portable than their contemporary desktop equals. Some models had standard or optional connections to drive an external video monitor, allowing a larger screen or use with video projectors.\n\nIBM PC-compatible suitcase format computers became available soon after the introduction of the PC, with the [[Compaq Portable]] being a leading example of the type. Later models included a [[hard drive]] to give roughly equivalent performance to contemporary desk top computers.\n\nThe development of thin plasma display and LCD screens permitted a somewhat smaller form factor, called the \"lunchbox\" computer. The screen formed one side of the enclosure, with a detachable keyboard and one or two half-height floppy disk drives, mounted facing the ends of the computer.  Some variations included a battery, allowing operation away from AC outlets.<ref name=\"SM04\">Scott Mueller, ''Upgrading and Repairing Laptops'', Que Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|0789728001}}, pp. 18\u201321</ref>\n\nNotebook computers such as the [[TRS-80 Model 100]] and [[Epson HX-20]] had roughly the plan dimensions of a sheet of typing paper ([[Paper size|ANSI A or ISO A4]]). These machines had a keyboard with slightly reduced dimensions compared to a desktop system, and a fixed LCD display screen coplanar with the keyboard.  These displays were usually small, with 8 to 16 lines of text, sometimes only 40 columns line length.  However, these machines could operate for extended times on disposable or rechargeable batteries. Although they did not usually include internal disk drives, this form factor often included a [[modem]] for telephone communication and often had provisions for external cassette or disk storage. Later, clam-shell format laptop computers with similar small plan dimensions were also called \"notebooks\".\n\n==== Laptop ====\n{{Main|Laptop}}\n[[File:MSI laptop with English Wikipedia screenshot 20100614.jpg|thumb|A laptop computer]]\n\nA [[laptop]] computer is designed for portability with \"[[Flip (form)|clamshell]]\" design, where the keyboard and computer components are on one panel, with a hinged second panel containing a flat display screen. Closing the laptop protects the screen and keyboard during transportation.  Laptops generally have a rechargeable [[battery (electricity)|battery]], enhancing their portability.  To save power, weight and space, laptop graphics cards are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to a desktop machine. For this reason, desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops for [[Video game|gaming]] purposes.\n \nUnlike desktop computers, only minor internal upgrades (such as memory and hard disk drive) are feasible owing to the limited space and power available. Laptops have the same input and output ports as desktops, for connecting to external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards. Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops, as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive.\n\n[[File:Acer aspire 4930G.jpg|thumb|An Acer Aspire desktop replacement laptop]]\n\nA [[desktop replacement computer]] is a portable computer that provides the full capabilities of a [[desktop computer]]. Such computers are currently large laptops. This class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers, and may have limited battery capacity or no battery.<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html Desktop notebooks stake their claim], accessed October 19, 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:HP 2133 Mini-Note PC (front view compare with pencil).jpg|thumb|An [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[netbook]] ]]\n\n[[Netbook]]s, also called mini notebooks or [[subnotebook]]s, were a subgroup of laptops<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-pc-was-supposed-to-die-a-decade-ago-instead-this-happened/|title=The PC was supposed to die a decade ago.

Microsoft-compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons like [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]], [[barcode]] readers, [[RFID]] readers and cameras. In 2007, with the release of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme: devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC, while devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional.<ref>[http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/jun07/newwmdev.aspx New Windows Mobile 6 Devices :: Jun/Jul 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304084831/http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/jun07/newwmdev.aspx |date=March 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Personal computer, exploded 6.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[exploded view]] of a personal computer and peripherals (some of which are optional):\n{{Ordered list\n|[[Image scanner|Scanner]]\n|[[Central processing unit|CPU]] ([[microprocessor]])\n|[[Computer memory|Memory]] ([[Random access memory|RAM]])|[[Expansion card]]s ([[graphics card]]s, etc.)\n\n|[[Power supply unit (computer)|Power supply]]\n|[[Optical disc]] drive\n|[[Storage (memory)|Storage]] ([[hard disk]] or [[SSD]])\n|[[Motherboard]]\n|[[Loudspeaker|Speakers]]\n|[[Computer display|Monitor]]\n|[[System software]]\n|[[Application software]]\n|[[Computer keyboard|Keyboard]]\n|[[Computer mouse|Mouse]]\n|[[External hard disk drive|External hard disk]]\n|[[Computer printer|Printer]]\n}}]]\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n\n[[Computer hardware]] is a comprehensive term for all physical and tangible parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. Some sub-systems of a personal computer may contain processors that run a fixed program, or [[firmware]], such as a keyboard controller. Firmware usually is not changed by the end user of the personal computer.\n\nMost 2010s-era computers only require users to plug in the power supply, monitor, and other cables. A typical [[desktop computer]] consists of a [[computer case]] (or \"tower\"), a metal chassis that holds the [[Computer power supply|power supply]], [[motherboard]], [[hard disk drive]], and often an [[optical disc drive]]. Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components. External devices such as a [[computer monitor]] or [[visual display unit]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], and a [[pointing device]] ([[Computer mouse|mouse]]) are usually found in a personal computer.\n\nThe [[motherboard]] connects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. The [[RAM]], graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard. The [[central processing unit]] (microprocessor chip) plugs into a [[CPU socket]], while the memory modules plug into corresponding memory sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard, while others use [[expansion slot]]s for graphics cards, network cards, or other [[Input/output|I/O]] devices.  The graphics card or sound card may employ a [[break out box]] to keep the analog parts away from the [[electromagnetic radiation]] inside the computer case. Disk drives, which provide mass storage, are connected to the motherboard with one cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually, disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage.\n\nFor large amounts of data, a [[tape drive]] can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case. The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer case. The monitor is also connected to the input/output (I/O) panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card. Capabilities of the personal computers hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition of [[expansion card]]s connected via an expansion [[computer bus|bus]]. Standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers include [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], [[PCI Express]] (PCIe), and [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] (a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters, found in older computers). Most modern personal computers have multiple physical PCI Express expansion slots, with some having PCI slots as well.\n\nA [[peripheral]] is \"a device connected to a computer to provide communication (such as input and output) or auxiliary functions (such as additional storage)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peripheral|title=Definition of PERIPHERAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> Peripherals generally connect to the computer through the use of USB ports or inputs located on the I/O panel. USB [[USB flash drive|Flash Drives]] provide portable storage using flash memory which allows users to access the files stored on the drive on any computer. [[Memory card]]s also provide portable storage for users, commonly used on other electronics such as mobile phones and digital cameras, the information stored on these cards can be accessed using a memory card reader to transfer data between devices. Webcams, which are either built into computer hardware or connected via USB are video cameras that records video in real time to either be saved to the computer or streamed somewhere else over the internet. [[Game controller]]s can be plugged in via USB and can be used as an input device for video games as an alternative to using keyboard and mouse. [[Headphones]] and speakers can be connected via USB or through an auxiliary port (found on I/O panel)  and allow users to listen to audio accessed on their computer, however speakers may also require an additional power source to operate. [[Microphone]]s can be connected through an audio input port on the I/O panel and allow the computer to convert sound into an electrical signal to be used or transmitted by the computer.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main|Computer software}}\n[[File:LibreOffice 6.0.6.2 Writer.png|alt=|thumb|A screenshot of the [[LibreOffice Writer]] software]]\nComputer software is any kind of [[computer program]], [[Algorithm|procedure]], or documentation that performs some task on a computer system.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0\n| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ\n| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software\n| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> The term includes [[application software]] such as [[word processor]]s that perform productive tasks for users, [[system software]] such as [[operating system]]s that interface with [[computer hardware]] to provide the necessary services for application software, and [[middleware]] that controls and co-ordinates [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]].\n[[File:GIMP 2.10.jpg|alt=|thumb|A screenshot of [[GIMP]], which is a [[raster graphics editor]].]]\nSoftware applications are common for [[word processing]], [[Internet]] browsing, [[Internet fax]]ing, [[e-mail]] and other digital messaging, [[multimedia]] playback, playing of [[computer game]], and [[computer programming]]. The user may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, most [[software]] written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, or \"[[usability|user-friendliness]]\" in mind. However, the [[software industry]] continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.\n\n=== Operating system ===\n{{Main|Operating system}}{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}\n\nAn operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with an [[User interface|interface]] used to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating [[Computer data storage|memory]], prioritizing system requests, controlling [[input/output|input and output]] devices, facilitating [[computer networking]], and managing files.\n\nCommon contemporary desktop operating systems are [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[FreeBSD]]. Windows, macOS, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of them were inspired by or directly inherited from the [[Unix]] operating system.\n\nEarly personal computers used operating systems that supported [[command line]] interaction, using an alphanumeric display and keyboard. The user had to remember a large range of commands to, for example, open a file for editing or to move text from one place to another. Starting in the early 1960s, the advantages of a [[graphical user interface]] began to be explored, but widespread adoption required lower cost graphical display equipment. By 1984, mass-market computer systems using graphical user interfaces were available; by the turn of the 21st century, text-mode operating systems were no longer a significant fraction of the personal computer market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/gui.html|title=GUI Definition|website=www.linfo.org|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Applications ===\n{{Main|Application software}}\nGenerally, a computer user uses application software to carry out a specific task.<ref name=\"Weik 2000\">{{Cite book|title=Computer Science and Communications Dictionary|last=Weik|first=Martin|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7923-8425-0|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}</ref> [[System software]] supports applications<ref name=\"Weik 2000\"/> and provides common services such as memory management, network connectivity and device drivers, all of which may be used by applications but are not directly of interest to the end user.

At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Ma\u2018bood (2/115)}}\n\nMunajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the \u2018awrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.<ref name=iqa/>\n\nWhen puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on [[Wudu|wudoo\u2019]] and [[ghusl]], paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age \u2013 around the age of three years \u2013 that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:<ref name=iqa/>\n\n# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister's clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother's actions and characteristics.\n\n# Teaching children that the \u2018awrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.<ref name=iqa/>\n \nFinally he stated, \u201cWith regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and \u2018awrahs. What is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam.\"<ref name=iqa/>\n\n===Adult===\n[[File:Atai (Walters MS 666) - A Juriconsult Giving Sexual Advice (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[mufti]] gives sexual advice in response to a woman's complaint about her son-in-law's inability to consummate his marriage to her daughter.

The term refers to the status of the female; [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which \"Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''[[umm walad]]'' (mother of a child, concubine).\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden and Boston |page=531}}</ref> The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her.

The word \"''surriyya''\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression \"[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]\" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam through some reform with Jews and non-Muslim people.

A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' (\"mother of the child\"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.<ref name=\"Suad 2006\"/>\n\nSurah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \"those whom one's right hands possess\" (female slaves), saying \" \u0623\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652\" (literally, \"their spouses or what their right hands possess\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.

These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.\n{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers.

And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}\n\nVerse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.<ref name=\"Suad 2007 531\">{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.\n\nAdditionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation.

One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. \"Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him.\" Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, \"You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!\" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that.

A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence.

A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zin\u0101\u02be punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the \u1e25add punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).<ref name=\"Kassam\"/>\n\nWhat distinguished a prototypical act of zin\u0101\u02be from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being \"coercive\" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of \"coercion\" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zin\u0101\u02be'' should receive the ''\u1e25add'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the \u1e25add punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zin\u0101\u02be'' due to their reduced capacity.<ref name=\"Kassam\"/>\n\nAccording to the M\u0101lik\u012b, \u1e24anbal\u012b, and Sh\u0101fi\u02be\u012b schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a \"right of God\" (''\u1e25aqq All\u0101h''), provoking the ''\u1e25add'' punishment; and a violation against a \"human\" (interpersonal) right (''\u1e25aqq \u0101dam\u012b''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''bu\u1e0d\u02be''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave.

The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.\n\nThere are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.\n\nFrom the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Suad 2006\"/>\n\nSodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, \"joining\") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, \"rubbing\"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zin\u0101\u02be'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zin\u0101\u02be'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.<ref name=\"Omar\"/>\nReligious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an \"abomination\" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes and bsnishing them from local places, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.<ref name=\"Rowson\"/>\n\n=== Homosexuality ===\n{{main|Zina|Homosexuality and Islam}}\nThe Qur'an strictly prohibits [[homosexuality]]<ref name=IslamQA>{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/10050 | title=Why does Islam forbid lesbianism and homosexuality? | publisher=[[Islamqa.info]] | accessdate=9 May 2015 | author=[[Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503131158/http://islamqa.info/en/10050 | archivedate=3 May 2015 }}</ref> through the story of [[Lot (Biblical)|Lot]] (see verses 7:80-84, 26:165-166, 11:69-83, 29:28-35 of the Qur'an; which is also rendered in the Biblical [[Book of Genesis]]), in Al-Nisa, Al-Araf and possibly verses in other surahs.<ref name=adang>Camilla Adang (2003), Ibn Hazam on Homosexuality, [[:fr:Qantara|Al Qantara]], Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 5-31</ref><ref name=somwr>Stephen O.

Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum.

At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Ma\u2018bood (2/115)}}\n\nMunajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the \u2018awrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.<ref name=iqa/>\n\nWhen puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on [[Wudu|wudoo\u2019]] and [[ghusl]], paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age \u2013 around the age of three years \u2013 that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:<ref name=iqa/>\n\n# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister's clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother's actions and characteristics.\n\n# Teaching children that the \u2018awrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.<ref name=iqa/>\n \nFinally he stated, \u201cWith regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and \u2018awrahs. What is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam.\"<ref name=iqa/>\n\n===Adult===\n[[File:Atai (Walters MS 666) - A Juriconsult Giving Sexual Advice (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[mufti]] gives sexual advice in response to a woman's complaint about her son-in-law's inability to consummate his marriage to her daughter.

The term refers to the status of the female; [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which \"Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''[[umm walad]]'' (mother of a child, concubine).\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden and Boston |page=531}}</ref> The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her.

The word \"''surriyya''\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression \"[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]\" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam through some reform with Jews and non-Muslim people.

A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' (\"mother of the child\"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.<ref name=\"Suad 2006\"/>\n\nSurah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \"those whom one's right hands possess\" (female slaves), saying \" \u0623\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652\" (literally, \"their spouses or what their right hands possess\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.

These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.\n{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers. Fornicator does not marry except a fornicatoress or polytheist women; and fornicatoress no one marry her except fornicator or polytheist man;and it is prohibited to believers.

And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}\n\nVerse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.<ref name=\"Suad 2007 531\">{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.\n\nAdditionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation.

One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. \"Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him.\" Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, \"You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!\" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that.

A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence.

A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zin\u0101\u02be punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the \u1e25add punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).<ref name=\"Kassam\"/>\n\nWhat distinguished a prototypical act of zin\u0101\u02be from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being \"coercive\" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of \"coercion\" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zin\u0101\u02be'' should receive the ''\u1e25add'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the \u1e25add punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zin\u0101\u02be'' due to their reduced capacity.<ref name=\"Kassam\"/>\n\nAccording to the M\u0101lik\u012b, \u1e24anbal\u012b, and Sh\u0101fi\u02be\u012b schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a \"right of God\" (''\u1e25aqq All\u0101h''), provoking the ''\u1e25add'' punishment; and a violation against a \"human\" (interpersonal) right (''\u1e25aqq \u0101dam\u012b''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''bu\u1e0d\u02be''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation.

The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.\n\nThere are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.\n\nFrom the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Suad 2006\"/>\n\nSodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, \"joining\") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, \"rubbing\"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zin\u0101\u02be'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zin\u0101\u02be'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.<ref name=\"Omar\"/>\nReligious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an \"abomination\" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes and bsnishing them from local places, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.<ref name=\"Rowson\"/>\n\n=== Homosexuality ===\n{{main|Zina|Homosexuality and Islam}}\nThe Qur'an strictly prohibits [[homosexuality]]<ref name=IslamQA>{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/10050 | title=Why does Islam forbid lesbianism and homosexuality? | publisher=[[Islamqa.info]] | accessdate=9 May 2015 | author=[[Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503131158/http://islamqa.info/en/10050 | archivedate=3 May 2015 }}</ref> through the story of [[Lot (Biblical)|Lot]] (see verses 7:80-84, 26:165-166, 11:69-83, 29:28-35 of the Qur'an; which is also rendered in the Biblical [[Book of Genesis]]), in Al-Nisa, Al-Araf and possibly verses in other surahs.<ref name=adang>Camilla Adang (2003), Ibn Hazam on Homosexuality, [[:fr:Qantara|Al Qantara]], Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 5-31</ref><ref name=somwr>Stephen O.

Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum.

The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]] in his [[Ihya\u2019 Ulum al-Din]]. \nFurthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of one's body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shari\u2019ah. Allah Most High mentions in [[An-Nisa]] the words of [[Satan]], when he said:\n\n{{Quote|\"I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.\"|[[An-Nisa]]:119}}\n\nHowever, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well-known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qur\u2019an and Hadith states: {{Quote|\"Necessities make prohibitions lawful.\"| (Ibn Nujaym, Al-Ashbah wa al-Naza\u2019ir 85)}}<ref name=\"DI\">\n{{cite web |author1=Muhammad ibn Adam |title=Permanent Contraception (Female Sterlisation) - Does Intention affect Permissibility? |url=http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |website=[[Darul Ifta]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009092820/http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |archive-date=2018-10-09 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n\nBeing sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: \n# \u2013 It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother's life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger.

Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation.

He used at least some of this money in late 1993 to purchase an [[AR-10]] semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania.\n\nBryant's father had tried to purchase a [[bed and breakfast]] property called Seascape, but Noelene (also known as Sally) and David Martin bought this property before his father could ready his finances, much to the disappointment of Bryant's father, who often complained to his son of the \"double dealing\" the Martins had done to secure the purchase. Bryant's father offered to buy another property from the Martins at Palmers Lookout Road, but they declined the offer. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and believed this event to be responsible for the depression that led to his father's 1993 [[suicide]]. Bryant later described the Martins as \"very mean people\" and as \"the worse{{sic}} people in my life.\"<ref name=\"Mullen\">{{Cite web\n |last=Mullen\n |first=Paul E.\n |date=4 May 1996\n |title=Psychiatric Report Martin Bryant\n |url=http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830073132/http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-date = 2017-08-30\n |work=Victorian Forensic Psychiatry Services \n |accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1995, Bryant became suicidal after deciding he had \"had enough\". He stated, \"I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away\". Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the [[massacre]].<ref name=\"Mullen\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, Bryant had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made inquiries about [[AR-15]] rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, non-handguns were not required to be registered in Tasmania.\n\nAccording to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to 12 weeks before the event.<ref name=\"Mullen\"/><ref name=\"SupremeCourtCase\"/>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nBryant's motivation for the massacre was the refusal of the sale of Seascape by owners David and Noelene Martin and to become notorious, as revealed by his lawyer, on the Channel 7 program \"Sunday Night\" air date Sunday, 6 March 2016. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted to know how many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/managing-martin-the-jailing-of-martin-bryant/3563950 |title=Managing Martin: The Jailing of Martin Bryant |work=Radio National |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\n=== Gun laws in Australia before the Port Arthur massacre ===\nA redesign of the laws for all States and Territories of Australia had been prepared by officers and presented at a meeting of Police Ministers' in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in 1995.

The facts were then presented in court on 19 November 1996.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Morning events====\nBryant was awakened at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. by his alarm clock. His girlfriend and other family members said he had never been known to use it since he did not work and had no other commitments. At 8:00&nbsp;a.m., his girlfriend left the house to visit her parents. Bryant left the house and switched on the burglar alarm, which registered the time as 9:47&nbsp;a.m.\n\nBryant travelled to Forcett, arriving some time around 11:00&nbsp;a.m. He continued to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45&nbsp;a.m. He stopped at the Seascape guest accommodation site <small>({{coord|43.11888|S|147.85326|E|scale:500|name=Ruin of Seascape guest accommodation}}<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.de/fotos/seascape-guesthouse?sort=mostpopular&mediatype=photography&phrase=seascape%20guesthouse Seascape guest accommodation site, Landmarks and Buildings identically in googlemaps and gettyimages.de], accessed 2018 April, 11</ref>)</small> that his father had wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.\n\nA couple stopped at Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they asked if they could have a look at the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His demeanour was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nBryant drove to Port Arthur, taking the keys to the Seascape properties after locking the doors. Bryant stopped at a car which had pulled over due to overheating and talked with two people there. He suggested that they come to the Port Arthur caf\u00e9 for some coffee later.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nHe travelled past the Port Arthur historic site towards a Palmer's Lookout Road property owned by the Martins, where he came across Roger Larner. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years previously. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, and asked if he could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. \"Bryant then responded that he might go to Nubeena first\" and he was going to return in the afternoon.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Port Arthur Historic Site====\n[[File:Port Arthur, Tasmania.JPG|thumbnail|Port Arthur Bay, Port Arthur, was the location of most of the shootings]]\n\nAt around 1:10&nbsp;p.m., Bryant got in line at the toll booth at the entrance to the historic site. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the caf\u00e9. The security manager saw him go up to the caf\u00e9 carrying a \"sports-type bag\" and a video camera, but ignored him. Bryant went into the caf\u00e9 and purchased a meal, which he ate on the deck outside. He attempted to start conversations with people about the lack of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|\"WASPs\"]] in the area and there not being as many [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists as usual. He appeared nervous and \"quite regularly\" looked back to the car-park and into the caf\u00e9.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9 murders====\nBryant finished his meal, walked into the caf\u00e9 and returned his tray, assisted by some people who opened the door for him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled out of it a [[Colt AR-15|Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine]] with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached. The bag also contained, among other things, the knife he had used to stab David Martin. It is believed the Colt magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was very small, with the tables very close together, and was particularly busy that day, with many people waiting for the next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia<ref name=\"massacre\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=9\u201311}}</ref> and were seated at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her in the back of the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nA 28-year-old New Zealand winemaker, Jason Winter, had been helping the busy caf\u00e9 staff.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Bryant turned towards Winter's wife Joanne and their 15-month-old son Mitchell, Winter threw a serving tray at Bryant in an attempt to distract him. Joanne Winter's father pushed his daughter and grandson to the floor and under the table.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n[[File:Port Arthur Memorial Garden.jpg|thumb|The caf\u00e9 structure in 2015. A memorial garden has been established at the site.]]\n\n44-year-old Anthony Nightingale stood up after the sound of the first shots, but had no time to move. Nightingale yelled \"No, not here!\" as Bryant pointed the weapon at him.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Nightingale leaned forward, he was fatally shot through the neck and spine.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nThe next table had held a group of ten friends,<ref name=\"massacre\" /> but some had just left the table to return their meal trays and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening\u200a\u2014\u200athey at first believed someone was letting off firecrackers. One of them made the comment \"That's not funny\" after hearing the first few shots, not realising that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, the back of their heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant then turned towards Tony and Sarah Kistan and Andrew Mills.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both men stood up at the noise of the initial shots, but had no time to move away. Andrew Mills was shot in the head. Tony Kistan was also shot from about two metres away, also in the head, but had managed to push his wife away prior to being shot. Sarah Kistan was apparently not seen by Bryant, as she was under the table by that time.\n\nThelma Walker and Pamela Law were injured by fragments before being dragged to the ground by their friend, Peter Crosswell, as the three sheltered underneath the table.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Also injured by fragments from these shots was Patricia Barker.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nIt was only then that the majority of the people in the caf\u00e9 began to realise what was happening and that the shots were not from [[historical reenactment in Australia|a reenactment at the historical site]]. At this point, there was great confusion, with many people not knowing what to do, as Bryant was near the main exit.\n\nBryant moved just a few metres and began shooting at the table where Graham Colyer, Carolyn Loughton and her daughter Sarah were seated. Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself on top of her daughter.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] from the gun going off beside her ear.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant pivoted around and shot Mervyn Howard who was seated.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The bullet passed through him, through a window of the caf\u00e9, and hit a table on the outside balcony.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant quickly followed up with a shot to the neck of Mervyn Howard's wife, Mary.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant then leaned over a vacant baby stroller and pointed the gun at her head and shot her a second time.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both of the Howards' injuries were fatal.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant was near the exit, preventing others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the caf\u00e9 towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up.<ref name=\"massacre2\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=11\u201315}}</ref> He was shot in the arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nAll of these events, from the first bullet that killed Ng, took approximately fifteen seconds, during which Bryant fired seventeen shots, killed twelve people, and wounded ten more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20010508013225/http://www.shootersnews.addr.com/cttranscript.htm</ref>\n\n====Gift shop murders====\nBryant moved towards the gift shop area, giving many people time to hide under tables and behind shop displays. He fatally shot the two local women who worked in the gift shop: 17-year-old Nicole Burgess, in the head, and 26-year-old Elizabeth Howard, in the arm and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nCoralee Lever and Vera Jary hid behind a hessian (burlap) screen with others.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Lever's husband Dennis was fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had attempted to escape through a locked door but could not.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Peter Nash lay down on top of his wife to hide her from Bryant.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Gwen Neander, trying to make it to the door, was shot in the head and killed.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant saw movement in the caf\u00e9 and moved near the front door. He shot at a table and hit Peter Crosswell, who was hiding under it, in the buttock.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Jason Winter, hiding in the gift shop, thought Bryant had left the building and made a comment about it to people near him before moving out into the open. Bryant saw him, with Winter stating \"No, no\" just prior to being shot, the bullet hitting his hand, neck and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A second shot to the head proved fatal to Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Fragments from those shots struck American tourist Dennis Olson, who had been hiding with his wife Mary and Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Dennis Olson suffered fragment injuries to his hand, scalp, eye and chest, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nIt is not immediately clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant walked back to the caf\u00e9 and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. He walked up to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was lying under her husband.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man,<ref>The identity of this man was suppressed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]]</ref> but the rifle's magazine was empty.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant killed eight people after moving to the gift shop, and wounded two others.\n\nIn the caf\u00e9 and gift shop combined, he fired twenty-nine shots, killed twenty people, and wounded twelve more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n====Car park murders====\nDuring the caf\u00e9 shooting, some staff members had been able to escape through the kitchen and alerted people outside. There were a number of coaches outside with lines of people, many of whom began to hide in the buses or in nearby buildings. Others did not understand the situation or were unsure where to go. Some people believed there was some sort of [[historical reenactment]] happening, and moved towards the area.\n\nAshley John Law, a site employee, was moving people away from the caf\u00e9 into the information centre when Bryant fired at him from {{convert|50|\u2013|100|metres|yards|-1|abbr=off}} away. The bullets missed Law and hit some trees nearby.\n\nBryant then moved towards the coaches. One of the coach drivers, Royce Thompson, was shot in the back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Brigid Cook was trying to guide people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people scrambling to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.\n\nBryant then quickly moved around another coach and fired at another group of people. Winifred Aplin, running to get to cover behind another coach, was fatally shot in the side.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Another bullet grazed Yvonne Lockley's cheek, but she was able to enter one of the coaches to hide, and survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nSome people then started moving away from the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled back to where Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a wildlife park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning to move towards Mason Cove and away from the buses.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant then continued along the car park as people tried to escape along the shore. Doug Hutchinson was attempting to get into a coach when he was shot in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He quickly ran around the front of the coach, and then along the shore to the jetty and hid.\n\nBryant then went to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|self loading rifle]].<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew up in front of her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they realised Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.\n\nBryant moved back to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> At an adjacent coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nNeville Quin, husband of Janet, had escaped to the jetty area, but returned to look for his wife. He had been forced to leave her earlier after Bryant shot her. Bryant exited the coach and, spotting Quin, chased him around the coaches. Bryant fired at him at least twice before Quin ran onto a coach. Bryant entered the coach and pointed the gun at Neville Quin's face, saying, \"No one gets away from me\".<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Quin ducked when he realised Bryant was about to pull the trigger. The bullet missed his head but hit his neck, momentarily paralysing him.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> After Bryant left, Quin managed to find his wife, although she later died in his arms.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Neville Quin was taken away by helicopter and survived.\n\nBryant fired at James Balasko, a U.S. citizen, hitting a nearby car. Balasko had been attempting to film the shooter. Many people, unable to use their parked cars, were hiding or running along Jetty Road and did not know where Bryant was because the gunfire was extremely loud and difficult to pinpoint.\n\nAt this time, Bryant had killed 26 people and injured 18.\n\n====Toll booth murders and carjacking====\n\nBryant then got back into his car and left the car park. Witnesses say he was sounding the horn and waving as he drove. Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where people were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.\n\nAhead of him were Nanette Mikac and her children, Madeline, 3, and Alannah, 6.<ref name=\"massacre3\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=15\u201323}}</ref> Nanette was carrying Madeline, and Alannah was running slightly ahead. By this point, they had run approximately {{convert|600|metres|yd}} from the car park.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out \"It's him!\"<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant stepped out of the car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> She did so, saying, \"Please don't hurt my babies\".<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant fired at some people hiding in a bush, but missed. Having seen the murders of the children, some people further up the road began running. They told drivers of cars coming down the road to go back. The people thought Bryant would head up the road, so instead they proceeded on foot down a dirt side road and hid in the bush. The cars reversed up the road to the toll booth.\n\nBryant drove up to the toll booth, where there were several vehicles, and blocked a 1980 [[BMW 7 Series (E23)|BMW 7 Series]] owned by Mary Rose Nixon.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and passengers Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out his rifle and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who shot him in the chest, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.<ref name=\"charges\">{{Cite web|title=The new charges against Bryant |url=http://www.geniac.net/portarthur/new.htm |date=9 July 1996 |publisher=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother car then came towards the toll booth and Bryant shot at it.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Graham Sutherland, was hit with glass. A second bullet hit the driver's door. Sutherland quickly reversed back up the road and left. Bryant then got into the BMW, leaving behind his [[Volvo 200 Series#History|Volvo 244]], including his [[USAS-12|Daewoo shotgun]] and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\nAt this point, Bryant had killed 33 and injured 19.\n\n====Service station murder and abduction====\nGraham Sutherland, who had just been shot at in his car, reversed back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white [[Toyota Corolla]] that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears got out of the car and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant then moved back to the passenger side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, but by the time he could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.\n\nZoe Hall was the 34th victim killed.\n\n====Seascape roadway====\nAs Bryant drove down to Seascape, he shot at a red [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Upon arriving at Seascape, he got out of his car. A [[Holden Frontera]] 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner, despite its broken throttle cable. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nAnother vehicle then drove down the road, carrying four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised he was carrying a gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nYet another car drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Simon Williams, was struck by fragments.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver of another approaching vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then got back into the BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.\n\nSometime after he stopped, Bryant removed Pears from the boot and handcuffed him to a stair rail within the house.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> At some point, he also set the BMW on fire.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He is believed to have arrived at the house by about 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===29 April 1996===\n\n====Capture====\nBryant was captured the following morning, when a fire started in the guest house, presumably set by Bryant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/martin-bryant-235987|title=Martin Bryant|website=Biography}}</ref> Bryant taunted police to \"come and get him\", but the police, believing the hostage was already dead, decided that the fire would eventually bring Bryant out. Bryant eventually ran out of the house with his clothes on fire, suffering burns to his back and buttocks. He was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nIt was discovered that Glenn Pears had been shot during or before the standoff and had died before the fire. The remains of the Martins were also found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre|title=Port Arthur Massacre - Background, Events, Aftermath, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> It was also determined they had been shot, and that Noelene Martin had suffered blunt-force trauma. They both died before the fire; witness accounts of the gunfire, as presented to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, place the time of death of David and Noelene Martin as being approximately noon on 28 April. One weapon was found burnt in the house, and the other on the roof of the adjacent building where police believed they had seen Bryant the night before. Both weapons had suffered from massive chamber blast pressure, possibly from the heat of the house fire.\n\n== Casualties ==\n=== Fatalities ===\nThe following is a list of those killed in the Port Arthur massacre.<ref name=\"charges\" />\n\n{| style=\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%;\"\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Winifred Joyce Aplin, 58\n* Walter John Bennett, 66\n* Nicole Louise Burgess, 17\n* Sou Leng Chung, 32\n* Elva Rhonda Gaylard, 48\n* Zoe Anne Hall, 28\n* Elizabeth Jayne Howard, 26\n* Mary Elizabeth Howard, 57\n* Mervyn John Howard, 55\n* Ronald Noel Jary, 71\n* Tony Vadivelu Kistan, 51\n* Leslie Dennis Lever, 53\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Sarah Kate Loughton, 15\n* David Martin, 72\n* Noelene \"Sally\" Joyce Martin, 69\n* Pauline Virjeana Masters, 49\n* Alannah Louise Mikac, 6\n* Madeline Grace Mikac, 3\n* Nanette Patricia Mikac, 36\n* Andrew Bruce Mills, 39\n* Peter Brenton Nash, 32\n* Gwenda Joan Neander, 67\n* William Xeeng Ng, 48\n* Anthony Nightingale, 44\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Mary Rose Nixon, 60\n* Glenn Roy Pears, 35\n* Russell James Pollard, 72\n* Janette Kathleen Quin, 50\n* Helene Maria Salzmann, 50\n* Robert Graham Salzmann, 57\n* Kate Elizabeth Scott, 21\n* Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68\n* Raymond John Sharp, 67\n* Royce William Thompson, 59\n* Jason Bernard Winter, 29\n|}\n\n==Aftermath and analysis==\nThe Port Arthur tourist site reopened a few weeks later, and since then a new restaurant has been built.

The two communities exchanged items to place at their respective memorials.\n\nPaul Mullen, a forensic psychiatrist with extensive involvement following the string of massacres in Australia and New Zealand, attributes both the Port Arthur massacre and some of the earlier massacres to the [[copycat crime|copycat effect]].<ref>Mullen, Paul quoted in Hannon K 1997, \"Copycats to Blame for Massacres Says Expert\", Courier Mail, 4/3/1997</ref> In this theory the saturation media coverage provides both instruction and [[perverse incentive]]s for dysfunctional individuals to imitate previous crimes. In Tasmania, a coroner found that a report on the current affairs programme ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', a few months earlier had guided one suicide, and may have helped create the expectation of a massacre.<ref>Hansen, Jane 1995. \"Tassie Guns\", A Current Affair 2 October 1995, featuring Roland Browne and Rebecca Peters of the Coalition for Gun Control.

He also claimed he did not take the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW. He said that he thought the man he took hostage must have died in the boot when the car exploded. He did not distinguish between the car fire and the later house fire. Such discrepancies raise speculations that Bryant was either lying during the police interview or was mentally incapable of recalling events accurately. Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but admitted to owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth.\n\nInitially Bryant pleaded not guilty to the 35 murders and did not provide a confession. Bryant changed his plea to guilty for a court hearing on 19 November 1996, where he was found guilty of all charges. The judge then ordered that all evidence for the case be sealed.\n\nOn 22 November, Bryant was sentenced to 35 sentences of life imprisonment for each count of murder and sentenced to 25 years for the remaining 36 charges on 5 other offences (20 attempted murders, 3 counts infliction of grievous bodily harm, the infliction of wounds upon a further 8 persons, 4 counts of aggravated assault and 1 count of unlawfully setting fire to property). All sentences are to be served concurrently <ref>P.

Bryant's father offered to buy another property from the Martins at Palmers Lookout Road, but they declined the offer. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and believed this event to be responsible for the depression that led to his father's 1993 [[suicide]].

He stated, \"I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away\". Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the [[massacre]].<ref name=\"Mullen\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, Bryant had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made inquiries about [[AR-15]] rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, non-handguns were not required to be registered in Tasmania.\n\nAccording to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to 12 weeks before the event.<ref name=\"Mullen\"/><ref name=\"SupremeCourtCase\"/>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nBryant's motivation for the massacre was the refusal of the sale of Seascape by owners David and Noelene Martin and to become notorious, as revealed by his lawyer, on the Channel 7 program \"Sunday Night\" air date Sunday, 6 March 2016. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted to know how many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre.

His girlfriend and other family members said he had never been known to use it since he did not work and had no other commitments. At 8:00&nbsp;a.m., his girlfriend left the house to visit her parents. Bryant left the house and switched on the burglar alarm, which registered the time as 9:47&nbsp;a.m.\n\nBryant travelled to Forcett, arriving some time around 11:00&nbsp;a.m. He continued to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45&nbsp;a.m. He stopped at the Seascape guest accommodation site <small>({{coord|43.11888|S|147.85326|E|scale:500|name=Ruin of Seascape guest accommodation}}<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.de/fotos/seascape-guesthouse?sort=mostpopular&mediatype=photography&phrase=seascape%20guesthouse Seascape guest accommodation site, Landmarks and Buildings identically in googlemaps and gettyimages.de], accessed 2018 April, 11</ref>)</small> that his father had wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.\n\nA couple stopped at Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they asked if they could have a look at the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His demeanour was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nBryant drove to Port Arthur, taking the keys to the Seascape properties after locking the doors. Bryant stopped at a car which had pulled over due to overheating and talked with two people there. He suggested that they come to the Port Arthur caf\u00e9 for some coffee later.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nHe travelled past the Port Arthur historic site towards a Palmer's Lookout Road property owned by the Martins, where he came across Roger Larner. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years previously. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, and asked if he could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. \"Bryant then responded that he might go to Nubeena first\" and he was going to return in the afternoon.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Port Arthur Historic Site====\n[[File:Port Arthur, Tasmania.JPG|thumbnail|Port Arthur Bay, Port Arthur, was the location of most of the shootings]]\n\nAt around 1:10&nbsp;p.m., Bryant got in line at the toll booth at the entrance to the historic site. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the caf\u00e9. The security manager saw him go up to the caf\u00e9 carrying a \"sports-type bag\" and a video camera, but ignored him. Bryant went into the caf\u00e9 and purchased a meal, which he ate on the deck outside. He attempted to start conversations with people about the lack of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|\"WASPs\"]] in the area and there not being as many [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists as usual. He appeared nervous and \"quite regularly\" looked back to the car-park and into the caf\u00e9.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9 murders====\nBryant finished his meal, walked into the caf\u00e9 and returned his tray, assisted by some people who opened the door for him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled out of it a [[Colt AR-15|Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine]] with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached. The bag also contained, among other things, the knife he had used to stab David Martin. It is believed the Colt magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was very small, with the tables very close together, and was particularly busy that day, with many people waiting for the next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia<ref name=\"massacre\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=9\u201311}}</ref> and were seated at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her in the back of the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nA 28-year-old New Zealand winemaker, Jason Winter, had been helping the busy caf\u00e9 staff.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Bryant turned towards Winter's wife Joanne and their 15-month-old son Mitchell, Winter threw a serving tray at Bryant in an attempt to distract him. Joanne Winter's father pushed his daughter and grandson to the floor and under the table.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n[[File:Port Arthur Memorial Garden.jpg|thumb|The caf\u00e9 structure in 2015. A memorial garden has been established at the site.]]\n\n44-year-old Anthony Nightingale stood up after the sound of the first shots, but had no time to move. Nightingale yelled \"No, not here!\" as Bryant pointed the weapon at him.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Nightingale leaned forward, he was fatally shot through the neck and spine.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nThe next table had held a group of ten friends,<ref name=\"massacre\" /> but some had just left the table to return their meal trays and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening\u200a\u2014\u200athey at first believed someone was letting off firecrackers. One of them made the comment \"That's not funny\" after hearing the first few shots, not realising that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, the back of their heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant then turned towards Tony and Sarah Kistan and Andrew Mills.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both men stood up at the noise of the initial shots, but had no time to move away. Andrew Mills was shot in the head. Tony Kistan was also shot from about two metres away, also in the head, but had managed to push his wife away prior to being shot. Sarah Kistan was apparently not seen by Bryant, as she was under the table by that time.\n\nThelma Walker and Pamela Law were injured by fragments before being dragged to the ground by their friend, Peter Crosswell, as the three sheltered underneath the table.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Also injured by fragments from these shots was Patricia Barker.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nIt was only then that the majority of the people in the caf\u00e9 began to realise what was happening and that the shots were not from [[historical reenactment in Australia|a reenactment at the historical site]]. At this point, there was great confusion, with many people not knowing what to do, as Bryant was near the main exit.\n\nBryant moved just a few metres and began shooting at the table where Graham Colyer, Carolyn Loughton and her daughter Sarah were seated. Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself on top of her daughter.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] from the gun going off beside her ear.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant pivoted around and shot Mervyn Howard who was seated.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The bullet passed through him, through a window of the caf\u00e9, and hit a table on the outside balcony.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant quickly followed up with a shot to the neck of Mervyn Howard's wife, Mary.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant then leaned over a vacant baby stroller and pointed the gun at her head and shot her a second time.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both of the Howards' injuries were fatal.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant was near the exit, preventing others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the caf\u00e9 towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up.<ref name=\"massacre2\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=11\u201315}}</ref> He was shot in the arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nAll of these events, from the first bullet that killed Ng, took approximately fifteen seconds, during which Bryant fired seventeen shots, killed twelve people, and wounded ten more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20010508013225/http://www.shootersnews.addr.com/cttranscript.htm</ref>\n\n====Gift shop murders====\nBryant moved towards the gift shop area, giving many people time to hide under tables and behind shop displays. He fatally shot the two local women who worked in the gift shop: 17-year-old Nicole Burgess, in the head, and 26-year-old Elizabeth Howard, in the arm and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nCoralee Lever and Vera Jary hid behind a hessian (burlap) screen with others.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Lever's husband Dennis was fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had attempted to escape through a locked door but could not.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Peter Nash lay down on top of his wife to hide her from Bryant.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Gwen Neander, trying to make it to the door, was shot in the head and killed.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant saw movement in the caf\u00e9 and moved near the front door. He shot at a table and hit Peter Crosswell, who was hiding under it, in the buttock.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Jason Winter, hiding in the gift shop, thought Bryant had left the building and made a comment about it to people near him before moving out into the open. Bryant saw him, with Winter stating \"No, no\" just prior to being shot, the bullet hitting his hand, neck and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A second shot to the head proved fatal to Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Fragments from those shots struck American tourist Dennis Olson, who had been hiding with his wife Mary and Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Dennis Olson suffered fragment injuries to his hand, scalp, eye and chest, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nIt is not immediately clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant walked back to the caf\u00e9 and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. He walked up to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was lying under her husband.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man,<ref>The identity of this man was suppressed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]]</ref> but the rifle's magazine was empty.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant killed eight people after moving to the gift shop, and wounded two others.\n\nIn the caf\u00e9 and gift shop combined, he fired twenty-nine shots, killed twenty people, and wounded twelve more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n====Car park murders====\nDuring the caf\u00e9 shooting, some staff members had been able to escape through the kitchen and alerted people outside. There were a number of coaches outside with lines of people, many of whom began to hide in the buses or in nearby buildings. Others did not understand the situation or were unsure where to go. Some people believed there was some sort of [[historical reenactment]] happening, and moved towards the area.\n\nAshley John Law, a site employee, was moving people away from the caf\u00e9 into the information centre when Bryant fired at him from {{convert|50|\u2013|100|metres|yards|-1|abbr=off}} away. The bullets missed Law and hit some trees nearby.\n\nBryant then moved towards the coaches. One of the coach drivers, Royce Thompson, was shot in the back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Brigid Cook was trying to guide people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people scrambling to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.\n\nBryant then quickly moved around another coach and fired at another group of people. Winifred Aplin, running to get to cover behind another coach, was fatally shot in the side.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Another bullet grazed Yvonne Lockley's cheek, but she was able to enter one of the coaches to hide, and survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nSome people then started moving away from the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled back to where Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a wildlife park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning to move towards Mason Cove and away from the buses.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant then continued along the car park as people tried to escape along the shore. Doug Hutchinson was attempting to get into a coach when he was shot in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He quickly ran around the front of the coach, and then along the shore to the jetty and hid.\n\nBryant then went to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|self loading rifle]].<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew up in front of her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they realised Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.\n\nBryant moved back to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> At an adjacent coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nNeville Quin, husband of Janet, had escaped to the jetty area, but returned to look for his wife. He had been forced to leave her earlier after Bryant shot her. Bryant exited the coach and, spotting Quin, chased him around the coaches. Bryant fired at him at least twice before Quin ran onto a coach. Bryant entered the coach and pointed the gun at Neville Quin's face, saying, \"No one gets away from me\".<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Quin ducked when he realised Bryant was about to pull the trigger. The bullet missed his head but hit his neck, momentarily paralysing him.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> After Bryant left, Quin managed to find his wife, although she later died in his arms.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Neville Quin was taken away by helicopter and survived.\n\nBryant fired at James Balasko, a U.S. citizen, hitting a nearby car. Balasko had been attempting to film the shooter. Many people, unable to use their parked cars, were hiding or running along Jetty Road and did not know where Bryant was because the gunfire was extremely loud and difficult to pinpoint.\n\nAt this time, Bryant had killed 26 people and injured 18.\n\n====Toll booth murders and carjacking====\n\nBryant then got back into his car and left the car park. Witnesses say he was sounding the horn and waving as he drove. Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where people were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.\n\nAhead of him were Nanette Mikac and her children, Madeline, 3, and Alannah, 6.<ref name=\"massacre3\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=15\u201323}}</ref> Nanette was carrying Madeline, and Alannah was running slightly ahead. By this point, they had run approximately {{convert|600|metres|yd}} from the car park.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out \"It's him!\"<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant stepped out of the car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> She did so, saying, \"Please don't hurt my babies\".<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant fired at some people hiding in a bush, but missed. Having seen the murders of the children, some people further up the road began running. They told drivers of cars coming down the road to go back. The people thought Bryant would head up the road, so instead they proceeded on foot down a dirt side road and hid in the bush. The cars reversed up the road to the toll booth.\n\nBryant drove up to the toll booth, where there were several vehicles, and blocked a 1980 [[BMW 7 Series (E23)|BMW 7 Series]] owned by Mary Rose Nixon.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and passengers Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out his rifle and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who shot him in the chest, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.<ref name=\"charges\">{{Cite web|title=The new charges against Bryant |url=http://www.geniac.net/portarthur/new.htm |date=9 July 1996 |publisher=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother car then came towards the toll booth and Bryant shot at it.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Graham Sutherland, was hit with glass. A second bullet hit the driver's door. Sutherland quickly reversed back up the road and left. Bryant then got into the BMW, leaving behind his [[Volvo 200 Series#History|Volvo 244]], including his [[USAS-12|Daewoo shotgun]] and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\nAt this point, Bryant had killed 33 and injured 19.\n\n====Service station murder and abduction====\nGraham Sutherland, who had just been shot at in his car, reversed back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white [[Toyota Corolla]] that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears got out of the car and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant then moved back to the passenger side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, but by the time he could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.\n\nZoe Hall was the 34th victim killed.\n\n====Seascape roadway====\nAs Bryant drove down to Seascape, he shot at a red [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Upon arriving at Seascape, he got out of his car. A [[Holden Frontera]] 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner, despite its broken throttle cable. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nAnother vehicle then drove down the road, carrying four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised he was carrying a gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nYet another car drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Simon Williams, was struck by fragments.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver of another approaching vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then got back into the BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.\n\nSometime after he stopped, Bryant removed Pears from the boot and handcuffed him to a stair rail within the house.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> At some point, he also set the BMW on fire.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He is believed to have arrived at the house by about 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===29 April 1996===\n\n====Capture====\nBryant was captured the following morning, when a fire started in the guest house, presumably set by Bryant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/martin-bryant-235987|title=Martin Bryant|website=Biography}}</ref> Bryant taunted police to \"come and get him\", but the police, believing the hostage was already dead, decided that the fire would eventually bring Bryant out. Bryant eventually ran out of the house with his clothes on fire, suffering burns to his back and buttocks. He was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nIt was discovered that Glenn Pears had been shot during or before the standoff and had died before the fire. The remains of the Martins were also found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre|title=Port Arthur Massacre - Background, Events, Aftermath, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> It was also determined they had been shot, and that Noelene Martin had suffered blunt-force trauma. They both died before the fire; witness accounts of the gunfire, as presented to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, place the time of death of David and Noelene Martin as being approximately noon on 28 April. One weapon was found burnt in the house, and the other on the roof of the adjacent building where police believed they had seen Bryant the night before. Both weapons had suffered from massive chamber blast pressure, possibly from the heat of the house fire.\n\n== Casualties ==\n=== Fatalities ===\nThe following is a list of those killed in the Port Arthur massacre.<ref name=\"charges\" />\n\n{| style=\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%;\"\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Winifred Joyce Aplin, 58\n* Walter John Bennett, 66\n* Nicole Louise Burgess, 17\n* Sou Leng Chung, 32\n* Elva Rhonda Gaylard, 48\n* Zoe Anne Hall, 28\n* Elizabeth Jayne Howard, 26\n* Mary Elizabeth Howard, 57\n* Mervyn John Howard, 55\n* Ronald Noel Jary, 71\n* Tony Vadivelu Kistan, 51\n* Leslie Dennis Lever, 53\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Sarah Kate Loughton, 15\n* David Martin, 72\n* Noelene \"Sally\" Joyce Martin, 69\n* Pauline Virjeana Masters, 49\n* Alannah Louise Mikac, 6\n* Madeline Grace Mikac, 3\n* Nanette Patricia Mikac, 36\n* Andrew Bruce Mills, 39\n* Peter Brenton Nash, 32\n* Gwenda Joan Neander, 67\n* William Xeeng Ng, 48\n* Anthony Nightingale, 44\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Mary Rose Nixon, 60\n* Glenn Roy Pears, 35\n* Russell James Pollard, 72\n* Janette Kathleen Quin, 50\n* Helene Maria Salzmann, 50\n* Robert Graham Salzmann, 57\n* Kate Elizabeth Scott, 21\n* Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68\n* Raymond John Sharp, 67\n* Royce William Thompson, 59\n* Jason Bernard Winter, 29\n|}\n\n==Aftermath and analysis==\nThe Port Arthur tourist site reopened a few weeks later, and since then a new restaurant has been built.

He also claimed he did not take the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW. He said that he thought the man he took hostage must have died in the boot when the car exploded. He did not distinguish between the car fire and the later house fire. Such discrepancies raise speculations that Bryant was either lying during the police interview or was mentally incapable of recalling events accurately. Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but admitted to owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth.\n\nInitially Bryant pleaded not guilty to the 35 murders and did not provide a confession. Bryant changed his plea to guilty for a court hearing on 19 November 1996, where he was found guilty of all charges. The judge then ordered that all evidence for the case be sealed.\n\nOn 22 November, Bryant was sentenced to 35 sentences of life imprisonment for each count of murder and sentenced to 25 years for the remaining 36 charges on 5 other offences (20 attempted murders, 3 counts infliction of grievous bodily harm, the infliction of wounds upon a further 8 persons, 4 counts of aggravated assault and 1 count of unlawfully setting fire to property). All sentences are to be served concurrently <ref>P.

The conquest of the islands took place gradually. The first to be acquired was [[Kythira|Cythera]] and the neighboring islet of [[Antikythera|Anticythera]], indirectly in 1238 and directly after 1363. In 1386, [[Corfu]] voluntarily became part of Venice's colonies. Following a century, Venice captured [[Zakynthos|Zante]] in 1485, [[Cephalonia]] in 1500 and [[Ithaca]] in 1503. The conquest was completed in 1718 with the capture of [[Lefkada]]. Each of the islands remained part of the Venetian ''[[Stato da M\u00e0r]]'' until [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] dissolved the Republic of Venice in 1797, annexing Corfu. The Ionian Islands are situated in the Ionian Sea, off the west coast of [[Geography of Greece|Greece]]. Cythera, the southernmost, is just off the southern tip of the [[Peloponnese]] and Corfu, the northernmost, is located at the entrance of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In modern Greek, the period of Venetian rule over Greek territory is known as ''Venetokratia'' or ''Enetokratia'' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}} or {{lang|el|\u0395\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}) and literally means \"rule of the Venetians\".<ref>[[#refBrameSaportaContrerasNewmeyer1986|Brame, Saporta, Contreras & Newmeyer]], p.&nbsp;213.</ref> It is believed that the Venetian period on the Ionian Islands was agreeable, especially compared with the coinciding ''Tourkokratia'' \u2014 [[Ottoman_Greece|Turkish rule]] over the remainder of present-day Greece.<ref>[[#refTsitselis1960|Tsitselis]], p.&nbsp;529.</ref>\n\nThe governor of the Ionian Islands during the Venetian period was the ''[[Provveditore generale da Mar]]'', who resided on [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]. Additionally, each island's authorities were divided into the Venetian and the domestic authorities. The economy of the islands was based on exporting local goods, primarily [[raisin]]s, [[olive oil]] and [[wine]], whereas [[Venetian lira]], the currency of Venice, was also the currency of the islands. Some features of the culture of Venice were incorporated in the culture of the Ionian Islands, thus influencing to this day local music, cuisine and language.  The [[Italian language]], for instance, which was introduced on the islands as the official language and was adopted by the upper class, is still popular today throughout the islands.\n\n== Relations between Venice and Byzantium ==\n[[File:Venice, by Bolognino Zaltieri, 1565.jpg|thumb|220px|right|View of Venice in 1565]]\nVenice was founded in 421 after the destruction of nearby communities by the [[Huns]] and the [[Lombards]]. In the shifting Italian borders of the following centuries, Venice benefited from remaining under the control of the [[Roman Empire]] - increasingly as the furtherest Northwestern outpost of the now [[Constantinople]] centered power.  During [[Justinian I]]'s reconquest of Italy from the Visigoths, Venice was an increasingly important stronghold for the Empire's [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].<ref>[[#refThiriet1975|Thiriet]], p.&nbsp;32.</ref> The political centre of the exarchate, and the most senior military officials of the Empire, were situated in [[Ravenna]].<ref>[[#refMauskopfDeliyannis2009|Mauskopf Deliyannis]], p.&nbsp;278.</ref><ref>[[#refGraftonMostSettis2010|Grafton, Most & Settis]], p.&nbsp;806.</ref> The subordinate military officials who were their representatives in the [[Venetian Lagoon|Venetian lagoons]] were called tribunes, and only in about AD 697 were the lagoons made a separate military command under a ''{{lang|la|dux}}'' ({{lang|vec|[[doge]]}}).<ref>[[#refLane1973|Lane]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Notwithstanding the election of the first {{lang|vec|[[Doge of Venice|Doge]]}}, vassalic evidence such as honours and orders received by the doge from the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] implies that Venice was considered part of the Byzantine Empire even after the capture of Ravenna by the Lombards.<ref name=\"Lane5\">[[#refLane1973|Lane]], p.&nbsp;5.</ref> Despite the {{lang|la|[[Pax Nicephori]]}} (803), which recognised Venice as Byzantine territory, the influence of the Eastern Roman Emperor slowly faded away.<ref name=\"Lane5\" /> By 814 Venice functioned as a fully independent republic.<ref>[[#refLuttwak2009|Luttwak]], p.&nbsp;151.</ref> Even so, Venice became a partner of the Empire and trading privileges were granted to it by the Emperors via treaties,<ref>[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;16.</ref> such as the [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian Treaty of 1082]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) was initially intended to invade Muslim-controlled areas; instead, the Crusaders attacked the capital of the Byzantine Empire, [[Constantinople]], resulting in the temporary dissolution of the empire and the [[sack of Constantinople|sack]] of its capital.<ref>[[#refLaiou2005|Laiou]], p.&nbsp;154.</ref> As Venice was one of the participants in the Crusade its relations with the Byzantine Empire were strained during this period.<ref name=\"Nicol66\">[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;66.</ref> Moreover, by styling themselves \"Lord of one-quarter and one-eighth of the whole Empire of Romania\" after the Crusade, the Doges of Venice contributed to the deterioration of the relations between the two states.<ref name=\"Nicol66\"/><ref>[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;254.</ref> Efforts to improve relations, for example through the [[Nicaean\u2013Venetian Treaty of 1219]], proved unsuccessful.<ref>[[#refNovoselova1971|Novoselova]], p.&nbsp;547.</ref> A period of friendly relations only followed the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in 1282, when Venice, foreseeing the fall of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles]], the French [[King of Sicily]], began forming closer relations with Byzantium.<ref name=NS599>[[#refNovoselova1971|Novoselova]], p.&nbsp;599.</ref> Venice had been bound by an alliance with Charles against Byzantium in 1281.<ref name=NS599/>\n\n== Appellation ==\n[[File:Venetian map of the castles of Corfu (1690).jpg|thumb|A {{circa|1690}} Venetian map of ''{{lang|it|Isola di Corfu : posseduta dalla Serenissima Republica di Venetia}}''.

The conquest of the islands took place gradually. The first to be acquired was [[Kythira|Cythera]] and the neighboring islet of [[Antikythera|Anticythera]], indirectly in 1238 and directly after 1363. In 1386, [[Corfu]] voluntarily became part of Venice's colonies. Following a century, Venice captured [[Zakynthos|Zante]] in 1485, [[Cephalonia]] in 1500 and [[Ithaca]] in 1503. The conquest was completed in 1718 with the capture of [[Lefkada]]. Each of the islands remained part of the Venetian ''[[Stato da M\u00e0r]]'' until [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] dissolved the Republic of Venice in 1797, annexing Corfu. The Ionian Islands are situated in the Ionian Sea, off the west coast of [[Geography of Greece|Greece]]. Cythera, the southernmost, is just off the southern tip of the [[Peloponnese]] and Corfu, the northernmost, is located at the entrance of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In modern Greek, the period of Venetian rule over Greek territory is known as ''Venetokratia'' or ''Enetokratia'' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}} or {{lang|el|\u0395\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}) and literally means \"rule of the Venetians\".<ref>[[#refBrameSaportaContrerasNewmeyer1986|Brame, Saporta, Contreras & Newmeyer]], p.&nbsp;213.</ref> It is believed that the Venetian period on the Ionian Islands was agreeable, especially compared with the coinciding ''Tourkokratia'' \u2014 [[Ottoman_Greece|Turkish rule]] over the remainder of present-day Greece.<ref>[[#refTsitselis1960|Tsitselis]], p.&nbsp;529.</ref>\n\nThe governor of the Ionian Islands during the Venetian period was the ''[[Provveditore generale da Mar]]'', who resided on [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]. Additionally, each island's authorities were divided into the Venetian and the domestic authorities. The economy of the islands was based on exporting local goods, primarily [[raisin]]s, [[olive oil]] and [[wine]], whereas [[Venetian lira]], the currency of Venice, was also the currency of the islands. Some features of the culture of Venice were incorporated in the culture of the Ionian Islands, thus influencing to this day local music, cuisine and language.  The [[Italian language]], for instance, which was introduced on the islands as the official language and was adopted by the upper class, is still popular today throughout the islands.\n\n== Relations between Venice and Byzantium ==\n[[File:Venice, by Bolognino Zaltieri, 1565.jpg|thumb|220px|right|View of Venice in 1565]]\nVenice was founded in 421 after the destruction of nearby communities by the [[Huns]] and the [[Lombards]]. In the shifting Italian borders of the following centuries, Venice benefited from remaining under the control of the [[Roman Empire]] - increasingly as the furtherest Northwestern outpost of the now [[Constantinople]] centered power.  During [[Justinian I]]'s reconquest of Italy from the Visigoths, Venice was an increasingly important stronghold for the Empire's [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].<ref>[[#refThiriet1975|Thiriet]], p.&nbsp;32.</ref> The political centre of the exarchate, and the most senior military officials of the Empire, were situated in [[Ravenna]].<ref>[[#refMauskopfDeliyannis2009|Mauskopf Deliyannis]], p.&nbsp;278.</ref><ref>[[#refGraftonMostSettis2010|Grafton, Most & Settis]], p.&nbsp;806.</ref> The subordinate military officials who were their representatives in the [[Venetian Lagoon|Venetian lagoons]] were called tribunes, and only in about AD 697 were the lagoons made a separate military command under a ''{{lang|la|dux}}'' ({{lang|vec|[[doge]]}}).<ref>[[#refLane1973|Lane]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Notwithstanding the election of the first {{lang|vec|[[Doge of Venice|Doge]]}}, vassalic evidence such as honours and orders received by the doge from the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] implies that Venice was considered part of the Byzantine Empire even after the capture of Ravenna by the Lombards.<ref name=\"Lane5\">[[#refLane1973|Lane]], p.&nbsp;5.</ref> Despite the {{lang|la|[[Pax Nicephori]]}} (803), which recognised Venice as Byzantine territory, the influence of the Eastern Roman Emperor slowly faded away.<ref name=\"Lane5\" /> By 814 Venice functioned as a fully independent republic.<ref>[[#refLuttwak2009|Luttwak]], p.&nbsp;151.</ref> Even so, Venice became a partner of the Empire and trading privileges were granted to it by the Emperors via treaties,<ref>[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;16.</ref> such as the [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian Treaty of 1082]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) was initially intended to invade Muslim-controlled areas; instead, the Crusaders attacked the capital of the Byzantine Empire, [[Constantinople]], resulting in the temporary dissolution of the empire and the [[sack of Constantinople|sack]] of its capital.<ref>[[#refLaiou2005|Laiou]], p.&nbsp;154.</ref> As Venice was one of the participants in the Crusade its relations with the Byzantine Empire were strained during this period.<ref name=\"Nicol66\">[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;66.</ref> Moreover, by styling themselves \"Lord of one-quarter and one-eighth of the whole Empire of Romania\" after the Crusade, the Doges of Venice contributed to the deterioration of the relations between the two states.<ref name=\"Nicol66\"/><ref>[[#refNicol1992|Nicol]], p.&nbsp;254.</ref> Efforts to improve relations, for example through the [[Nicaean\u2013Venetian Treaty of 1219]], proved unsuccessful.<ref>[[#refNovoselova1971|Novoselova]], p.&nbsp;547.</ref> A period of friendly relations only followed the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in 1282, when Venice, foreseeing the fall of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles]], the French [[King of Sicily]], began forming closer relations with Byzantium.<ref name=NS599>[[#refNovoselova1971|Novoselova]], p.&nbsp;599.</ref> Venice had been bound by an alliance with Charles against Byzantium in 1281.<ref name=NS599/>\n\n== Appellation ==\n[[File:Venetian map of the castles of Corfu (1690).jpg|thumb|A {{circa|1690}} Venetian map of ''{{lang|it|Isola di Corfu : posseduta dalla Serenissima Republica di Venetia}}''.
