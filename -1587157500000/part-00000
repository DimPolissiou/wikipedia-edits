For example, when an herbivore feeds on a single corn seedling leaf, the plant will emit volatiles from all its leaves, whether or not they too have been damaged. Locally induced defenses aid parasitoids in targeting their foraging behaviors to the exact location of the herbivore on the plant. Systemic defenses are less spatially specific and may serve to confuse the enemy once the source plant is located. A plant might employ both local and systemic responses simultaneously.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Morphological mechanisms of enemy attraction ==\n\n=== Domatia ===\n[[File:Guioa_acutifolia_leaflet_detail_Kewarra_4493.jpg|thumb|A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of ''[[Guioa acutifolia]]'']] \n{{main|Domatium}}\n\nNatural enemies must survive long enough and respond quickly enough to plant volatiles in order to benefit the plant through predatory behavior. Certain plant structures, called [[domatia]], can selectively reinforce mutualisms with natural enemies and increase the fitness benefit they receive from that mutualism by ensuring the survival and proximity of natural enemies. Domatia provide a kind of housing or refuge for predators from both [[Abiotic stress|abiotic]] stressors, such as desiccation, and biotic stress, such as predation from higher-order predators. Therefore, they ensure not only better survival, but eliminate the time required for natural enemies to locate and travel to the damaged plant. For this reason, natural enemies that make use of domatia are often said to serve as \"bodyguards\" for the plant in or on which they live. Domatia may be as well-developed as acacia tree thorns, or as simple and incidental as a depression or crevice in a leaf stem, but they are distinguishable from [[galls]] and other similar structures in that they are not induced by the insect but formed constitutively by the plant.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n=== Nutritional rewards ===\n\nAs long as natural enemies have some potential to be [[omnivorous]], plants can provide food resources to encourage their retention and increase the impact they have on herbivore populations. This potential, however, can hinge on a number of insect traits. For example, [[hemipteran]] predators can use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to make use of leaves, stems, and fruits, but spiders with [[chelicerae]] cannot.<ref name=\"Price\" /> Still, insects widely considered to be 100% carnivorous have recently been observed to diverge from expected feeding behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rubinoff |first=D. |title=Web-Spinning Caterpillar Stalks Snails |journal=Science |date=22 July 2005 |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=575 |doi=10.1126/science.1110397 |pmid=16040699}}</ref>\nSome plants simply tolerate a low level of herbivory by natural enemies for the service they provide in ridding the plant of more serious herbivores. Others, however, have structures thought to serve no purpose other than attracting and provisioning natural enemies. These structures derived from a long history of [[coevolution]] between the first and third trophic levels. A good example is the [[extrafloral nectaries]] which many [[myrmecophytes]] and other [[angiosperms]] sport on leaves, bracts, stems, and fruits. Nutritionally, extrafloral nectaries are similar to floral nectaries, but differ as they do not encourage the visiting insect to come into contact with pollen at any point. Their existence is therefore not the product of a pollinator-plant mutualism, but rather a tritrophic, defensive interaction.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Human uses ==\n[[File:KarottenZwiebeln 266.JPG|right|thumb|[[Companion planting]] controls pests partly by favouring natural enemies.<ref name=Landis/>]]\n\nExploitation of tritrophic interactions has the capacity to directly benefit agricultural systems.

These can include the physical size, shape, density, maturity, colour, and texture of a given plant species. Specific plant features such as the hairiness or glossiness of vegetation can have mixed effects on different natural enemies. For example, [[Trichome|trichomes]] decrease hunting efficiency in many natural enemies, as trichomes tend to slow or prevent movement due to the physical obstacles they present or due to the adhesive secretions they produce. However, this is not the case for all natural enemies. For example, [[Encarsia formosa|E. formosa,]] a whitefly parasitoid is slowed by plant hairs which allows the parasitoid to detect and parasitize a higher number of juvenile [[Whitefly|whiteflies]].<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nTrichomes not only benefit the plant physically, but also chemically. Trichomes can develop in a variety of forms including, hairs or as pocket-like structures called glandular trichomes. These glandular trichomes store species-specific secondary metabolites such as [[Terpenoid|terpenoids]] and [[Phenols|phenolics]] in a pocket like structure between the cell wall and the cuticle of the plant. When glandular trichomes burst upon contact, they release these secondary metabolites and the strong odor and bitter taste of these substances cause insect herbivores to repel. An example of trichomes used as a chemical defense against herbivores are found in the leaves of [[Stinging plant|stinging plants]] such as [[Urtica dioica|''U. dioica''.]] These leaves contain needle-like trichomes filled with a mix of histamine, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, and serotonin which cause severe inflammation and irritation. These trichomes have a glassy looking tip which snaps off when it comes to contact with an herbivore and the needle-like trichome acts as a syringe, injecting the cocktail of histamines and acids into the skin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taiz|first=Lincoln|title=Fundamentals of Plant Physiology|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=511}}</ref>\n\nTrials involving [[Coccinellidae|Coccinelids]] have illustrated that many of these beetles have a distinct preference for the type of leaf surface they frequent.

The extent of the influence largely depends on the evolutionary history shared between the two as well as on the pathogens' method of infection and survival duration outside of a host. Several studies have shown that different insect host plants contain various compounds which cause different levels of insect mortality when certain entomopathogens are simultaneously injected. In some cases, significant increases in mortality are recorded, up to 50-fold in some studies. However, other research reveals that certain plants influence entomopathogens in negative ways, reducing their efficacy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cory, J.

For example, when an herbivore feeds on a single corn seedling leaf, the plant will emit volatiles from all its leaves, whether or not they too have been damaged. Locally induced defenses aid parasitoids in targeting their foraging behaviors to the exact location of the herbivore on the plant. Systemic defenses are less spatially specific and may serve to confuse the enemy once the source plant is located. A plant might employ both local and systemic responses simultaneously.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Morphological mechanisms of enemy attraction ==\n\n=== Domatia ===\n[[File:Guioa_acutifolia_leaflet_detail_Kewarra_4493.jpg|thumb|A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of ''[[Guioa acutifolia]]'']] \n{{main|Domatium}}\n\nNatural enemies must survive long enough and respond quickly enough to plant volatiles in order to benefit the plant through predatory behavior. Certain plant structures, called [[domatia]], can selectively reinforce mutualisms with natural enemies and increase the fitness benefit they receive from that mutualism by ensuring the survival and proximity of natural enemies. Domatia provide a kind of housing or refuge for predators from both [[Abiotic stress|abiotic]] stressors, such as desiccation, and biotic stress, such as predation from higher-order predators. Therefore, they ensure not only better survival, but eliminate the time required for natural enemies to locate and travel to the damaged plant. For this reason, natural enemies that make use of domatia are often said to serve as \"bodyguards\" for the plant in or on which they live. Domatia may be as well-developed as acacia tree thorns, or as simple and incidental as a depression or crevice in a leaf stem, but they are distinguishable from [[galls]] and other similar structures in that they are not induced by the insect but formed constitutively by the plant.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n=== Nutritional rewards ===\n\nAs long as natural enemies have some potential to be [[omnivorous]], plants can provide food resources to encourage their retention and increase the impact they have on herbivore populations. This potential, however, can hinge on a number of insect traits. For example, [[hemipteran]] predators can use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to make use of leaves, stems, and fruits, but spiders with [[chelicerae]] cannot.<ref name=\"Price\" /> Still, insects widely considered to be 100% carnivorous have recently been observed to diverge from expected feeding behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rubinoff |first=D. |title=Web-Spinning Caterpillar Stalks Snails |journal=Science |date=22 July 2005 |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=575 |doi=10.1126/science.1110397 |pmid=16040699}}</ref>\nSome plants simply tolerate a low level of herbivory by natural enemies for the service they provide in ridding the plant of more serious herbivores. Others, however, have structures thought to serve no purpose other than attracting and provisioning natural enemies. These structures derived from a long history of [[coevolution]] between the first and third trophic levels. A good example is the [[extrafloral nectaries]] which many [[myrmecophytes]] and other [[angiosperms]] sport on leaves, bracts, stems, and fruits. Nutritionally, extrafloral nectaries are similar to floral nectaries, but differ as they do not encourage the visiting insect to come into contact with pollen at any point.

These can include the physical size, shape, density, maturity, colour, and texture of a given plant species. Specific plant features such as the hairiness or glossiness of vegetation can have mixed effects on different natural enemies. For example, [[Trichome|trichomes]] decrease hunting efficiency in many natural enemies, as trichomes tend to slow or prevent movement due to the physical obstacles they present or due to the adhesive secretions they produce. However, this is not the case for all natural enemies. For example, [[Encarsia formosa|E. formosa,]] a whitefly parasitoid is slowed by plant hairs which allows the parasitoid to detect and parasitize a higher number of juvenile [[Whitefly|whiteflies]].<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nTrichomes not only benefit the plant physically, but also chemically. Trichomes can develop in a variety of forms including, hairs or as pocket-like structures called glandular trichomes. These glandular trichomes store species-specific secondary metabolites such as [[Terpenoid|terpenoids]] and [[Phenols|phenolics]] in a pocket like structure between the cell wall and the cuticle of the plant. When glandular trichomes burst upon contact, they release these secondary metabolites and the strong odor and bitter taste of these substances cause insect herbivores to repel. An example of trichomes used as a chemical defense against herbivores are found in the leaves of ''[[Stinging plant|Urtica dioica]]''. These leaves contain needle-like trichomes filled with a mix of histamine, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, and serotonin which cause severe inflammation and irritation. These trichomes have a glassy looking tip which snaps off when it comes to contact with an herbivore and the needle-like trichome acts as a syringe, injecting the cocktail of histamines and acids into the skin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taiz|first=Lincoln|title=Fundamentals of Plant Physiology|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=511}}</ref>\n\nTrials involving [[Coccinellidae|Coccinelids]] have illustrated that many of these beetles have a distinct preference for the type of leaf surface they frequent.

It showed that wild varieties produced higher volumes of nectar and attracted a wider variety of natural enemies. This research points towards the idea that the process of breeding new cotton varieties has overlooked natural resistance traits in the pursuit of high yielding varieties that can be protected by pesticides. While this study did not find clear relationships between pest suppression and level of cotton domestication, it did highlight several studies which have shown this relationship. The studies illustrated a significant correlation between plants bearing EFNs and lower pest levels along with greater levels of natural enemies; one study also showed that the feeding of herbivores can directly induce nectar production.These collective findings illustrate the potential benefits that could be gained through incorporating the desirable genetics of wild varieties into cultivated varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Llandres, A.

The extent of the influence largely depends on the evolutionary history shared between the two as well as on the pathogens' method of infection and survival duration outside of a host. Several studies have shown that different insect host plants contain various compounds which cause different levels of insect mortality when certain entomopathogens are simultaneously injected. In some cases, significant increases in mortality are recorded, up to 50-fold in some studies. However, other research reveals that certain plants influence entomopathogens in negative ways, reducing their efficacy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cory, J.

For example, the mortality of pea aphids was higher in the group of aphids that were found on plants with fewer wax exudates compared to plants with more wax exudates.

Plants can also influence pathogen efficacy indirectly, and this typically occurs either by increasing the susceptibility of the herbivore hosts or by changing their behavior. This influence can often take the form of altered growth rates, herbivore physiology, or feeding habits.

It was shown that virus-infected aphids feeding on the plants introduced a virus into the phloem. The virus was passively transported in the phloem and was carried throughout the plant. This caused the aphids that were feeding in separate locations from the infected aphids to become infected as well.

The group was originally named My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (lead vocalist), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass guitar) and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under a variety of different names and with several lineup changes before finally deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1969. The band released their [[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)|first album]] in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns would later be replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]], and King by [[Steve Gaines]]. At the height of their fame during the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\".\n\nThe band abruptly ceased when Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]] were killed in an [[1977 Mississippi CV-240 crash|airplane crash on October 20, 1977]], but reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as its lead vocalist. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record with co-founder Rossington (being the band's sole continuous member), Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996.

The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' then-current hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. They soon approached guitarist [[Allen Collins]] to join the band, though Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway.

Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in [[Macon, Georgia]]-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=Oxford Music Online|website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather [[Shorty Medlocke]] was an influence in the writing of \"[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]\".

When Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]]. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until 1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'', which used the track \"One More Time\" from the early Muscle Shoals sessions with guitar overdubs done in 1975 by [[Ed King]].

Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label that was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions for the album, only playing on two tracks.  He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part which Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album.  After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 }}</ref> The album featured the hit song \"[[Free Bird]]\", which received national airplay,<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Their 1974 follow-up, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough.  Its single, \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", reached #8 on the charts that August.

In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}} }}</ref> Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement before its release, with Kooper left with the tapes to complete the mix.<ref>Al Kooper: Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock 'N' Roll Survivor (1998)</ref> Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. Van Zant and King's guitar roadie were arrested the night prior and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings which broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to [[Los Angeles]], believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> The band continued for the next several months with two guitarists rather than their usual \"three guitar army\". In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, [[Cassie Gaines]] and [[JoJo Billingsley]] (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added, although they were not considered official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album ''[[Gimme Back My Bullets]]'' was released, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as [[Leslie West]], its search continued until Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, [[Steve Gaines|Steve]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\n\nThen Steve Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in [[Kansas City]] on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly reconstituted band recorded the double-live album ''[[One More from the Road]]'' at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)]] in Atlanta, and performed at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] festival in Great Britain, headlined by [[the Rolling Stones]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1977]]\n1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'' turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them.

So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" \u2013 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]\" and \"[[That Smell]]\".

Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Hiatus (1977\u20131987)===\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed [[the Rossington-Collins Band]], which released two MCA albums, \"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\" in 1980 and \"This Is The Way\" in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, [[Dale Krantz]], as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s, \"Returned to the Scene of the Crime\" in 1986 and \"Love Your Man\" in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\u20131988.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]].

Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him).<ref name=\"Ult\">[https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allen-collins-car-accident/ \"The Day Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitarist Allen Collins Was Paralyzed in a Car Accident\"]; Jan 29, 2016 article; Ultimate Classic Rock, online website; accessed Oct 4, 2019</ref>  Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, leaving Rossington as the only remaining founding member.<ref name=\"Ult\"/>\n\nThe reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album ''[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987''. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness|newspaper=[[Florida Trend]]}}</ref> However, continued lineup changes and natural attrition has led to a relaxation in recent years.\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''.

That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993.  Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. The band's third post-reunion album, ''[[Endangered Species (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|Endangered Species]]'', featured mostly acoustic instrumentation and remakes of many of the band's classic 1970s songs.

The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour.  Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.\n\nThe band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/> Wilkeson's death resulted in the band with two remaining members from the classic pre-crash lineups.\n\nThe first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003.  This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song \"Red, White and Blue\".  The band also released a double collection album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the band did a show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]], ''Crossroads'', a concert featuring country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]] and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 [[Hughie Thomasson]] left the band to reform his Southern Rock band [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]].

On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Dickey Betts]]. In the summer of 2005, lead singer [[Johnny Van Zant]] had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months.

[[Jacksonville, Florida]], in 1964. The group was originally named My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (lead vocalist), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass guitar) and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under a variety of different names and with several lineup changes before finally deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1969. The band released their [[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)|first album]] in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns would later be replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]], and King by [[Steve Gaines]]. At the height of their fame during the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\".\n\nThe band abruptly ceased when Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]] were killed in an [[1977 Mississippi CV-240 crash|airplane crash on October 20, 1977]], but reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as its lead vocalist. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record with co-founder Rossington (being the band's sole continuous member), Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996.

The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' then-current hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. They soon approached guitarist [[Allen Collins]] to join the band, though Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway. Collins was soon convinced that Van Zant meant him no harm and he agreed to join the fledgling band.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\">If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, Passion Pictures, Directed by Stephen Kijak, 2018</ref> Bassist [[Larry Junstrom]] soon rounded out the lineup and the band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to The Noble Five<ref name=Name_Changes>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title= History Lessons |publisher= Lynyrd Skynyrd History site (Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com) |date= |accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref> before becoming The One Percent by 1968.<ref name=Name_Changes/>\n\nStill known as The One Percent in 1969, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had \"1% talent\".

Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in [[Macon, Georgia]]-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=Oxford Music Online|website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather [[Shorty Medlocke]] was an influence in the writing of \"[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]\".

In 1971, they made some recordings at the famous [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] with Walker and Medlocke serving as the rhythm section, but without the participation of Burns.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Medlocke and Walker left the band to play with another southern rock band, [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]].  When Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist, [[Leon Wilkeson]]. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until 1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'', which used the track \"One More Time\" from the early Muscle Shoals sessions with guitar overdubs done in 1975 by [[Ed King]]. Also in 1972, roadie [[Billy Powell]] became the band's keyboardist after Ronnie Van Zant heard him playing his rendition of \"Free Bird\".{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Peak (1973\u20131977)===\nIn 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta.  Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label that was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions for the album, only playing on two tracks.  He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part which Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album.  After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 }}</ref> The album featured the hit song \"[[Free Bird]]\", which received national airplay,<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Their 1974 follow-up, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough.  Its single, \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", reached #8 on the charts that August. (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" for the band, but they never recorded it.)<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was the only single to crack the top ten.<ref name=\"Butler, J.

In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}} }}</ref> Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement before its release, with Kooper left with the tapes to complete the mix.<ref>Al Kooper: Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock 'N' Roll Survivor (1998)</ref> Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. Van Zant and King's guitar roadie were arrested the night prior and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings which broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to [[Los Angeles]], believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> The band continued for the next several months with two guitarists rather than their usual \"three guitar army\". In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, [[Cassie Gaines]] and [[JoJo Billingsley]] (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added, although they were not considered official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album ''[[Gimme Back My Bullets]]'' was released, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as [[Leslie West]], its search continued until Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, [[Steve Gaines|Steve]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\n\nThen Steve Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in [[Kansas City]] on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly reconstituted band recorded the double-live album ''[[One More from the Road]]'' at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)]] in Atlanta, and performed at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] festival in Great Britain, headlined by [[the Rolling Stones]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1977]]\n1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'' turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would \"all be in his shadow one day\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2013 L.A.

So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" \u2013 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]\" and \"[[That Smell]]\".

Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band.

Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, [[Dale Krantz]], as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s, \"Returned to the Scene of the Crime\" in 1986 and \"Love Your Man\" in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\u20131988.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash.

He formed the [[Allen Collins Band]] in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band and released one MCA studio album titled \"Here, There & Back\". He was visibly suffering from Kathy's death; he excessively drank and consumed drugs. On January 29, 1986, Collins, then 33, crashed his [[Ford Thunderbird]] into a ditch near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend Debra Jean Watts and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Woman-Killed-Rock-Musician-Injured-In-One-Car-Accident/id-60be797135c45eefa4c334ecc2679ca7 |title=Woman Killed, Rock Musician Injured In One-Car Accident| publisher=Associated Press| date=January 30, 1986| accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Ult\"/>\n\n===Return (1987\u20131995)===\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him).<ref name=\"Ult\">[https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allen-collins-car-accident/ \"The Day Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitarist Allen Collins Was Paralyzed in a Car Accident\"]; Jan 29, 2016 article; Ultimate Classic Rock, online website; accessed Oct 4, 2019</ref>  Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, leaving Rossington as the only remaining founding member.<ref name=\"Ult\"/>\n\nThe reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album ''[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987''. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness|newspaper=[[Florida Trend]]}}</ref> However, continued lineup changes and natural attrition has led to a relaxation in recent years.\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993.  Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. The band's third post-reunion album, ''[[Endangered Species (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|Endangered Species]]'', featured mostly acoustic instrumentation and remakes of many of the band's classic 1970s songs.  On the album, Kurt Custer was replaced by [[Owen Hale]] on drums.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Member changes and deaths (1996\u20132019)===\nEd King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant.

The result was a major retooling of the band's 'guitar army'.  Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band's songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.\n\nThe first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was entitled [[Twenty (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|''Twenty'']].  The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour.  Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.\n\nThe band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/> Wilkeson's death resulted in the band with two remaining members from the classic pre-crash lineups.\n\nThe first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003.  This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song \"Red, White and Blue\".  The band also released a double collection album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the band did a show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]], ''Crossroads'', a concert featuring country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]] and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 [[Hughie Thomasson]] left the band to reform his Southern Rock band [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]]. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida; he was 55 years old.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOn February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party in Jacksonville with special guests [[3 Doors Down]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant's brother [[Donnie Van Zant]] of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Dickey Betts]]. In the summer of 2005, lead singer [[Johnny Van Zant]] had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], with [[Kid Rock]] standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Lynyrd 2008 (1).jpg|thumb|right|The band in 2008]]\n[[Mark Matejka|Mark \"Sparky\" Matejka]], formerly of the country music band [[Hot Apple Pie]], joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson's replacement.

In such cases, the defensive team will not be allowed to make a line change.\n*A puck that leaves out of play in the offensive zone will remain in the offensive zone for the next face-off.\n*Players that lose their helmet during play must return to the bench as soon as it is feasible until it can be replaced, or the player must retrieve their helmet.\n*Linesmen will now drop the puck at centre ice after goals and at the start of overtime instead of the referees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/nhl-2019-20-what-rules-have-changed-for-the-upcoming-season/n85slrk7luvt1b0nu1e9sd56p|title=NHL rules 2019-20: What has changed for the upcoming season?|publisher=Sporting News|date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n;Expansion of video review<ref name=\"rulechange\"/><ref name=\"newrules\"/>\n* Teams now have an unlimited number of coach's challenges, but failed challenges will now result in delay-of-game penalties instead of the loss of their timeout. The first failed challenge will result in a two-minute minor, and each subsequent failed challenge will result in a four-minute double-minor.\n* A team may challenge goals that follow plays in the offensive zone that should have instead resulted in a stoppage before the puck went into the net.
