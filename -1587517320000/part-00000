The ROCAF's primary mission is the defense of the airspace over and around [[Taiwan]]. Priorities of the ROCAF include the development of long range reconnaissance and surveillance networks, integrating [[C4ISTAR]] systems to increase battle effectiveness, procuring counterstrike weapons, next generation fighters, and hardening airfields and other facilities to survive a surprise attack.\n\nIn May 2005, the Ministry of National Defense indicated its intention to transfer command of all defensive missile systems to the ROCAF, while future offensive missiles would be placed under a newly formed missile command. As of 2006, all medium and long range SAM units were transferred from ROC Army's Missile Command to ROCAF, while ROCAF's airbase security units were transferred to ROC Army Military Police. However, it was revealed that in January 2011, five years of problems of integrating those long range ex-ROC Army SAM units into ROCAF has forced ROCAF high command to return those units back to ROC Army's Missile Command. Missile Command is now directly under Defense Ministry's GHQ control.\n\nIn July 2010, former United States Air Force deputy under secretary for international affairs, Bruce Lemkin, said that Taiwan's ability to defend its airspace had degraded due to its ageing fighters and that the sale of new fighter aircraft to Taiwan was an urgent priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|title=INTERVIEW - Taiwan overdue for F-16 jets, ex U.S. official say|author=Reuters Editorial|date=5 July 2010|work=Reuters India|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204145337/http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|archive-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the ROC Air Force has trouble getting fighter planes from abroad due to mainland China's attempts to suppress fighter sales from any country.

In this [[Warlord era|period]], various airplanes were purchased and deployed by warlords in their struggle for power until nominal [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]] in 1928. In February 1932, US Reserve Lt. [[Robert McCawley Short]], who was transporting armed Chinese aircraft, shot down an IJN aircraft on February 19, 1932, and downed another on February 22 before he was killed (he was posthumously raised to the rank of colonel in the Chinese Air Service).\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the Yangtze river including support for the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The Chinese frontline fighter aircraft initially were mainly the Curtiss Hawk II and III and the [[Boeing P-26]] model 281, and engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on August 14, 1937, when Imperial Japanese Navy warplanes raided [[Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport|Chienchiao airbase]]; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A5M fighters in what is among the world's first aerial dogfighting between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft. A unique mission in May 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10|B-10]] bombers fly a mission over Japan, but dropping only propaganda leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]], four years before 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japanese home islands. It was a war of attrition for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]] were lost early in the war. Code breaking operations played a role in the conflict. A Japanese radio intercept unit was attached to the landing forces at Shanghai. IJN Lt. Commander Tsunezo Wachi and a Lt. Yamada, an expert in Chinese codes, enabled Japanese to make preemptive strikes against ROCAF airfields.<ref>{{cite book|last1=RADM.

From 1946 to 1948, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROCAF participated in combat against the [[People's Liberation Army]] engaging in air-to-air combat on at least eleven occasions in the areas surrounding the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The ROCAF reportedly enjoyed a 31:1 kill ratio against the PLA. GHQ was evacuated to Taiwan along with the rest of the ROC Government in April 1949 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|title=Taiwan in Time: The great retreat - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730170752/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|archive-date=2018-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref> The ROCAF assisted in halting the PLA advance at the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] on [[Kinmen]] the same year.\n\nThe ROCAF regularly patrolled the Taiwan Straits and fought many engagements with its Communist counterpart (the [[PLAAF]]). The ROCAF received second hand equipment from the US at that time, such as the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the ROCAF was involved in combat air patrols over the Taiwan Strait and engaged the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] and PLAN-AF on several occasions. The ROCAF was also the testbed of American technology at this time. The first successful kill scored by an air-to-air missile was accomplished by a ROCAF F-86 Sabre with then experimental [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. ROCAF pilots also flew [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] recon overflights of the PRC during this time with assistance from the USAF. Known as the [[Black Cat Squadron]] they flew a total of 220 missions, with 102 missions over mainland China, losing 5 aircraft. All five were shot down by [[SA-2|SA-2 surface-to-air missiles]], the same type of surface-to-air missile that shot down [[Gary Powers]] over the USSR in 1960. The 34th \"[[Black Bat Squadron]]\" flew low level missions into China as part of its mapping PRC growing air defense networks, conducting ESM and ECM missions, inserting agents behind enemy lines, and air drop resupply missions.\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|C-123Bs in flight over US 1950s, Aircraft 641 was later transferred to Taiwan to support CIA operations]]\nStarting in November 1967, the ROC secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the US and the ROV as part of [[Republic of China in the Vietnam War|its participation in the Vietnam War]]. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force. The unit's strength included two [[C-123]] cargo aircraft, seven flight officers and two mechanics, even though a higher number of military personnel was involved through rotation.

Development of the [[AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo|F-CK-1 ''Ching-kuo'' Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF)]] began in 1984 due to U.S. refusal to sell [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] to the ROCAF as a result of changes in national policy between the U.S. and the [[People's Republic of China]]. After a successful maiden flight in 1989, the domestically produced fighter entered service in 1994. However, the ROCAF was subsequently able to obtain F-16s from the United States as well as [[Mirage 2000-5]] fighters from France, resulting in delays to later IDF development that had been anticipated.\n\nIn response to American refusals to supply \"smart bombs\", Taiwan is developing their own equivalent of the [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] for attacks against the PRC mainland in case of invasion preparations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130921/DEFREG03/309210010/Taiwan-Develops-Smart-Munitions-Against-China-Report |title=Taiwan develops 'smart' munitions against China: report |date=21 September 2013 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Taiwan]] is looking to replace its current fleet of [[AIDC AT-3|AT-3]] jet trainers and [[Northrop F-5|F-5]] LIFT planes with 66 advanced trainers.

The ROCAF's primary mission is the defense of the airspace over and around [[Taiwan]]. Priorities of the ROCAF include the development of long range reconnaissance and surveillance networks, integrating [[C4ISTAR]] systems to increase battle effectiveness, procuring counterstrike weapons, next generation fighters, and hardening airfields and other facilities to survive a surprise attack.\n\nIn May 2005, the Ministry of National Defense indicated its intention to transfer command of all defensive missile systems to the ROCAF, while future offensive missiles would be placed under a newly formed missile command. As of 2006, all medium and long range SAM units were transferred from ROC Army's Missile Command to ROCAF, while ROCAF's airbase security units were transferred to ROC Army Military Police. However, it was revealed that in January 2011, five years of problems of integrating those long range ex-ROC Army SAM units into ROCAF has forced ROCAF high command to return those units back to ROC Army's Missile Command. Missile Command is now directly under Defense Ministry's GHQ control.\n\nIn July 2010, former United States Air Force deputy under secretary for international affairs, Bruce Lemkin, said that Taiwan's ability to defend its airspace had degraded due to its ageing fighters and that the sale of new fighter aircraft to Taiwan was an urgent priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|title=INTERVIEW - Taiwan overdue for F-16 jets, ex U.S. official say|author=Reuters Editorial|date=5 July 2010|work=Reuters India|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204145337/http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|archive-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the ROC Air Force has trouble getting fighter planes from abroad due to mainland China's attempts to suppress fighter sales from any country.

In this [[Warlord era|period]], various airplanes were purchased and deployed by warlords in their struggle for power until nominal [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]] in 1928. In February 1932, US Reserve Lt. [[Robert McCawley Short]], who was transporting armed Chinese aircraft, shot down an IJN aircraft on February 19, 1932, and downed another on February 22 before he was killed (he was posthumously raised to the rank of colonel in the Chinese Air Service).\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the Yangtze river including support for the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The Chinese frontline fighter aircraft initially were mainly the Curtiss Hawk II and III and the [[Boeing P-26]] model 281, and engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on August 14, 1937, when Imperial Japanese Navy warplanes raided [[Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport|Chienchiao airbase]]; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A5M fighters in what is among the world's first aerial dogfighting between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft. A unique mission in May 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10|B-10]] bombers fly a mission over Japan, but dropping only propaganda leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]], four years before 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japanese home islands. It was a war of attrition for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]] were lost early in the war. Code breaking operations played a role in the conflict. A Japanese radio intercept unit was attached to the landing forces at Shanghai. IJN Lt. Commander Tsunezo Wachi and a Lt. Yamada, an expert in Chinese codes, enabled Japanese to make preemptive strikes against ROCAF airfields.<ref>{{cite book|last1=RADM.

From 1946 to 1948, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROCAF participated in combat against the [[People's Liberation Army]] engaging in air-to-air combat on at least eleven occasions in the areas surrounding the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The ROCAF reportedly enjoyed a 31:1 kill ratio against the PLA. GHQ was evacuated to Taiwan along with the rest of the ROC Government in April 1949 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|title=Taiwan in Time: The great retreat - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730170752/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|archive-date=2018-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref> The ROCAF assisted in halting the PLA advance at the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] on [[Kinmen]] the same year.\n\nThe ROCAF regularly patrolled the Taiwan Straits and fought many engagements with its Communist counterpart (the [[PLAAF]]). The ROCAF received second hand equipment from the US at that time, such as the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the ROCAF was involved in combat air patrols over the Taiwan Strait and engaged the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] and PLAN-AF on several occasions. The ROCAF was also the testbed of American technology at this time. The first successful kill scored by an air-to-air missile was accomplished by a ROCAF F-86 Sabre with then experimental [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. ROCAF pilots also flew [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] recon overflights of the PRC during this time with assistance from the USAF. Known as the [[Black Cat Squadron]] they flew a total of 220 missions, with 102 missions over mainland China, losing 5 aircraft. All five were shot down by [[SA-2|SA-2 surface-to-air missiles]], the same type of surface-to-air missile that shot down [[Gary Powers]] over the USSR in 1960. The 34th \"[[Black Bat Squadron]]\" flew low level missions into China as part of its mapping PRC growing air defense networks, conducting ESM and ECM missions, inserting agents behind enemy lines, and air drop resupply missions.\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|C-123Bs in flight over US 1950s, Aircraft 641 was later transferred to Taiwan to support CIA operations]]\nStarting in November 1967, the ROC secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the US and the ROV as part of [[Republic of China in the Vietnam War|its participation in the Vietnam War]]. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force. The unit's strength included two [[C-123]] cargo aircraft, seven flight officers and two mechanics, even though a higher number of military personnel was involved through rotation.

It is Colombia's 4th busiest airport in  passenger volume, with 5,600,000 people using the airport in 2016. It is the third largest airport in Colombia in terms of area and construction. The airport often serves as the [[Flight plan#Alternate airports|alternate airport]] for [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1 - El Dorado Int'l Airport]] and other Colombian airports.\n\nAlfonso Bonilla Airport lies in the center of the wide and fertile [[Cauca River]] valley, which runs north - south between the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Colombian Andes]] ranges. It is approximately 5 hours flight from [[Santiago de Chile]], 50 minutes from [[Quito|Quito, Ecuador]], and about 3 hours 18 minutes from [[Miami]] airport.\n\nThe airport has one 3.000m long runway, equipped with the following navigation aids: primary radar, [[Secondary Surveillance Radar|secondary radar]], [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]], [[Approach Lighting System|ALS]], PAPI, RVR, [[Runway#Runway lighting|runway centerline lights]], threshold lights, and taxiway lights. The airport has SEI IX<ref>[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/12tr012.pdf Security measures]</ref> protection.\n\nThe Cali [[non-directional beacon]] (Ident: '''AS''') is located {{convert|0.59|nmi|km}} off the Runway 02 approach threshold. The Cali [[VOR-DME]] (Ident: '''CLO''') is located {{convert|7.78|nmi|km}} off the Runway 02 threshold.<ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/AS/Cali_NDB_CO/#lat=3.51990008354187,lon=-76.38569641113281,zoom=17,type=Satellite Cali NDB]</ref><ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/CLO/Cali_VOR-DME_CO/#lat=3.3970777869080426,lon=-76.41293466091157,zoom=14,type=Satellite Cali VOR]</ref>\n\nAlfonso Bonilla airport is notable for being one of the very few secondary airports in [[Latin America]] that operates 24 hours a day. This is made possible not only by the year-round stable, consistent meteorological conditions but also because it is {{convert|14|km}} away from both Cali and Palmira. That distance frees it from any environmental/noise restrictions, allowing aircraft to take off and land at any time of day. Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport has [[non-stop flight]]s to the United States, Spain, Ecuador, Panama and Peru.\n\n==History==\nOn April 21, 1921 Ferruccio Guicciardi flew his Italian-made Macchi-Hanriot HD-1, (named \"'''''Telegraph I'''''\") from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to Cali, with stops in Quito and Pasto, Colombia. This was the first aircraft ever to land in Cali. He claimed the $9,500 peso prize offered by the Department of Valle and the Cali City Council to the first pilot who landed in the city. This event marked the birth of aviation  activity in the capital of Valle del Cauca.\n\n===SCADTA===\nFollowing the war with [[Peru]] in 1932, President [[Enrique Olaya Herrera]] sought the help of '''''SCADTA''''' engineers and pilots to find a suitable site for an airport capable of providing air support to military operations. After evaluating several alternatives, the German pilot Herbert Boy chose an area called \"'''''El Guabito'''''\" because of its location, proximity to the city and an extension of Juanchito Antioquia Avenue. After leveling the land with bulldozers a fledgling Air Force Base and Air National Guard station were built and operations began on September 21, 1933. Eventually, the number of airlines operating from the airport grew to include ''TACA de Colombia'' and VIARCO SAETA along with the already established SCADTA Panagra.\n\nHowever, Panagra began looking for a suitable place for an airport in order to link South America with Panama through Cali, as well as its domestic flights operated by [[Avianca]]. To this end they acquired land in the municipality of Candelaria,  18 miles from the center of Cali. On April 17, 1947 the modern facilities at \"'''''Calipuerto'''''\" were inaugurated. The airport passed to the Colombian state in the 1950s and was subsequently taken over by the Civil Aeronautics Department in 1968.\n\nIn 1946, the company VIARCO valle, under the management of Ricardo A. Deeb, implemented an expansion policy including the construction of its own airport in Cali. The airport would be open to all airlines  in the country except [[Avianca]]. In November 1946, the Aviation Authority requested an inspection of the new \"'''''El Limonnar'''''\" airport, located in the Pasoancho area of the city. In early 1947, the works were completed at the airport, which was put in service equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment at that time. ''LANSA'' and other smaller companies also moved operations to this airport from the military airport at El Guabito, later renamed the Marco Fidel Suarez AFB. El Limonar was closed in 1954 following a merger between ''LANSA'' and Avianca and the subsequent transfer of operations to Calipuerto. The city of Cali, like [[Bogota]], at that time had three active airports in operation. When the new Palmaseca Airport opened the old Calipuerto buildings and runways were adapted and expanded to house Cavasa, an agricultural and food products distribution centre.\n\n===Palmaseca International Airport===\nThe history of the new airport is directly linked to the 1971 Pan American Games, which were held in Cali. The infrastructure required to host an event of this magnitude made both the local and national government agencies broaden their horizons and commit to building the long-awaited and much needed facility. The Civil Aeronautics Agency had already purchased a large plot of land from Hacienda Palmaseca in the neighbouring town of Palmira. The project was beset by operational and financial difficulties, and the central government had to inject a further US$35 million in order to complete the physical construction and meet international aviation safety standards. Furthermore, new roads linking the airport to the industrial city of Yumbo and the main Cali - Palmira highway were also built as part of the project.\n\n'''''Palmaseca International Airport''''' was inaugurated on July 24, 1971 during the government of President [[Misael Pastrana Borrero]]. It had 3000m long runway, taxiways, parking apron, and a main terminal building for domestic and international flights. The terminal was equipped with airline service counters, restaurants, shops, a small hotel and even a nondenominational prayer chapel for nervous passengers. Although some critics initially claimed it was unnecessarily large and expensive for the city's needs at the time, air operations and passenger numbers quickly grew, justifying the size and cost of the project. The electronic, communications and safety equipment at the airport was recognized when it was designated as the alternate for Bogot\u00e1's El Dorado Int'l. Airport.\n\nIn June 1989 local authorities renamed the airport in honour of \"'''''Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n'''''\", a local  civic leader and journalist who played a prominent role in the approval and construction of the airport. This decision proved highly unpopular with the people of Cali, and there were serious efforts made to reverse the decision. Even the Business Guilds and the Cali Chamber of Commerce formally requested that the government intercede and force the Civil Aeronautics Agency to change the name back to  \"'''''Palmaseca'''''\".<ref>Escobar, Jaime. Aviacol.net</ref>\n\n==Reform and Privatisation==\nAt the beginning of 1982, \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez, Director of Civil Aeronautics, made the decision to decentralize the management of two important international airports: Palmaseca in Cali and Olaya Herrera in Medell\u00edn. Palmaseca would be administered by a mixed economy company, proposed by the Permanent Business Committee of Valle del Cauca and the Cali Chamber of Commerce. The entity that would have to abide by the rules of public establishments would be 90% economically backed by state capital and 10% by private capital. The shareholders included Empresas P\u00fablicas de Cali, Palmira, Cortuvalle, C.V.C and Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera del Transporte. This decentralization was never carried out and only years later the privatization process began\n\nIn the mid-1980s, part of the international terminal satellite collapsed, causing many criticisms of the design and construction firms of the building. In 1986 Civil Aeronautics had to assume the reconstruction of the international terminal satellite, together with the reinforcement in the rest of the structure.\n\nThe md 1980's saw the construction of the cargo terminal, the general aviation area and a new airport fire station. In mid-1989 the main runway was repaved, which had deteriorated along 700 meters of the 3000 total meters in length. The general aviation area was also built, which unfortunately soon became a clandestine center for drug trafficking operations.\n\nFor this reason the Aeroclub del Pacifico decided to acquire a large plot of land near the Free Trade Zone, adjacent to the header 1-9 to build its new facilities with direct access to the taxiway.\n\nYears later the National Museum of Transport was built in that area, which is well worth visiting.\n\n==Structure and capacity==\n*Loading facilities feature a 747 freighter dock, bonded warehouse, in-transit area, free trade zone, cargo loading and unloading vehicles and equipment, public health officials, secure storage for valuables, express and messenger center.\n*Avianca has an Executive Lounge on the top floor of the Domestic Satellite Terminal, offering free Wi-Fi, cable TV, a wet bar and snacks counter, free newspapers and charging ports for mobile devices.\n\n==Services==\nThere are car hire desks, ATMs, currency exchange services, public phones, and free Wi-Fi.\n*'''Eating''': Restaurants, caf\u00e9s, fast food outlets, and two bars.\n*'''Shopping''': Souvenir items, bookshops, duty-free perfume, liquor and emeralds, pharmacy, sporting apparel and equipment, electronic devices\n*'''Baggage''': Airlines offer baggage claim offices for passengers who have lost their luggage.\n*'''Parking''': There is a large parking area in front of the terminal.\n*'''Hotels''': There is a Hotel named GHL comfort at 3rd level of airport where one can stay.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n[[File:Cartafueyu de los vuelos dende Cali.svg|thumb|Map of domestic flights.]]\n\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], all regular scheduled flights are currently suspended.\n\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[Albatros Airlines]] | [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o Caribbean International Airport|Porlamar]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]]\n| [[Avianca]] | [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport|Cartagena]], [[Madrid-Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medell\u00edn\u2013JMC]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[John F.

It is Colombia's 4th busiest airport in  passenger volume, with 5,600,000 people using the airport in 2016. It is the third largest airport in Colombia in terms of area and construction. The airport often serves as the [[Flight plan#Alternate airports|alternate airport]] for [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1 - El Dorado Int'l Airport]] and other Colombian airports.\n\nAlfonso Bonilla Airport lies in the center of the wide and fertile [[Cauca River]] valley, which runs north - south between the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Colombian Andes]] ranges. It is approximately 5 hours flight from [[Santiago de Chile]], 50 minutes from [[Quito|Quito, Ecuador]], and about 3 hours 18 minutes from [[Miami]] airport.\n\nThe airport has one 3.000m long runway, equipped with the following navigation aids: primary radar, [[Secondary Surveillance Radar|secondary radar]], [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]], [[Approach Lighting System|ALS]], PAPI, RVR, [[Runway#Runway lighting|runway centerline lights]], threshold lights, and taxiway lights.

This is made possible not only by the year-round stable, consistent meteorological conditions but also because it is {{convert|14|km}} away from both Cali and Palmira. That distance frees it from any environmental/noise restrictions, allowing aircraft to take off and land at any time of day. Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport has [[non-stop flight]]s to the United States, Spain, Ecuador, Panama and Peru.\n\n==History==\nOn April 21, 1921 Ferruccio Guicciardi flew his Italian-made Macchi-Hanriot HD-1, (named \"'''''Telegraph I'''''\") from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to Cali, with stops in Quito and Pasto, Colombia. This was the first aircraft ever to land in Cali. He claimed the $9,500 peso prize offered by the Department of Valle and the Cali City Council to the first pilot who landed in the city. This event marked the birth of aviation  activity in the capital of Valle del Cauca.\n\n===SCADTA===\nFollowing the war with [[Peru]] in 1932, President [[Enrique Olaya Herrera]] sought the help of '''''SCADTA''''' engineers and pilots to find a suitable site for an airport capable of providing air support to military operations. After evaluating several alternatives, the German pilot Herbert Boy chose an area called \"'''''El Guabito'''''\" because of its location, proximity to the city and an extension of Juanchito Antioquia Avenue. After leveling the land with bulldozers a fledgling Air Force Base and Air National Guard station were built and operations began on September 21, 1933. Eventually, the number of airlines operating from the airport grew to include ''TACA de Colombia'' and VIARCO SAETA along with the already established SCADTA Panagra.\n\nHowever, Panagra began looking for a suitable place for an airport in order to link South America with Panama through Cali, as well as its domestic flights operated by [[Avianca]]. To this end they acquired land in the municipality of Candelaria,  18 miles from the center of Cali. On April 17, 1947 the modern facilities at \"'''''Calipuerto'''''\" were inaugurated. The airport passed to the Colombian state in the 1950s and was subsequently taken over by the Civil Aeronautics Department in 1968.\n\nIn 1946, the company VIARCO valle, under the management of Ricardo A. Deeb, implemented an expansion policy including the construction of its own airport in Cali. The airport would be open to all airlines  in the country except [[Avianca]]. In November 1946, the Aviation Authority requested an inspection of the new \"'''''El Limonnar'''''\" airport, located in the Pasoancho area of the city. In early 1947, the works were completed at the airport, which was put in service equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment at that time. ''LANSA'' and other smaller companies also moved operations to this airport from the military airport at El Guabito, later renamed the Marco Fidel Suarez AFB. El Limonar was closed in 1954 following a merger between ''LANSA'' and Avianca and the subsequent transfer of operations to Calipuerto. The city of Cali, like [[Bogota]], at that time had three active airports in operation. When the new Palmaseca Airport opened the old Calipuerto buildings and runways were adapted and expanded to house Cavasa, an agricultural and food products distribution centre.\n\n===Palmaseca International Airport===\nThe history of the new airport is directly linked to the 1971 Pan American Games, which were held in Cali. The infrastructure required to host an event of this magnitude made both the local and national government agencies broaden their horizons and commit to building the long-awaited and much needed facility. The Civil Aeronautics Agency had already purchased a large plot of land from Hacienda Palmaseca in the neighbouring town of Palmira. The project was beset by operational and financial difficulties, and the central government had to inject a further US$35 million in order to complete the physical construction and meet international aviation safety standards. Furthermore, new roads linking the airport to the industrial city of Yumbo and the main Cali - Palmira highway were also built as part of the project.\n\n'''''Palmaseca International Airport''''' was inaugurated on July 24, 1971 during the government of President [[Misael Pastrana Borrero]]. It had 3000m long runway, taxiways, parking apron, and a main terminal building for domestic and international flights. The terminal was equipped with airline service counters, restaurants, shops, a small hotel and even a nondenominational prayer chapel for nervous passengers. Although some critics initially claimed it was unnecessarily large and expensive for the city's needs at the time, air operations and passenger numbers quickly grew, justifying the size and cost of the project. The electronic, communications and safety equipment at the airport was recognized when it was designated as the alternate for Bogot\u00e1's El Dorado Int'l. Airport.\n\nIn June 1989 local authorities renamed the airport in honour of \"'''''Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n'''''\", a local  civic leader and journalist who played a prominent role in the approval and construction of the airport. This decision proved highly unpopular with the people of Cali, and there were serious efforts made to reverse the decision. Even the Business Guilds and the Cali Chamber of Commerce formally requested that the government intercede and force the Civil Aeronautics Agency to change the name back to  \"'''''Palmaseca'''''\".<ref>Escobar, Jaime. Aviacol.net</ref>\n\n==Reform and Privatisation==\nAt the beginning of 1982, \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez, Director of Civil Aeronautics, made the decision to decentralize the management of two important international airports: Palmaseca in Cali and Olaya Herrera in Medell\u00edn. Palmaseca would be administered by a mixed economy company, proposed by the Permanent Business Committee of Valle del Cauca and the Cali Chamber of Commerce. The entity that would have to abide by the rules of public establishments would be 90% economically backed by state capital and 10% by private capital. The shareholders included Empresas P\u00fablicas de Cali, Palmira, Cortuvalle, C.V.C and Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera del Transporte. This decentralization was never carried out and only years later the privatization process began\n\nIn the mid-1980s, part of the international terminal satellite collapsed, causing many criticisms of the design and construction firms of the building. In 1986 Civil Aeronautics had to assume the reconstruction of the international terminal satellite, together with the reinforcement in the rest of the structure.\n\nThe md 1980's saw the construction of the cargo terminal, the general aviation area and a new airport fire station. In mid-1989 the main runway was repaved, which had deteriorated along 700 meters of the 3000 total meters in length. The general aviation area was also built, which unfortunately soon became a clandestine center for drug trafficking operations.\n\nFor this reason the Aeroclub del Pacifico decided to acquire a large plot of land near the Free Trade Zone, adjacent to the header 1-9 to build its new facilities with direct access to the taxiway.\n\nYears later the National Museum of Transport was built in that area, which is well worth visiting.\n\n==Structure and capacity==\n*Loading facilities feature a 747 freighter dock, bonded warehouse, in-transit area, free trade zone, cargo loading and unloading vehicles and equipment, public health officials, secure storage for valuables, express and messenger center.\n*Avianca has an Executive Lounge on the top floor of the Domestic Satellite Terminal, offering free Wi-Fi, cable TV, a wet bar and snacks counter, free newspapers and charging ports for mobile devices.\n\n==Services==\nThere are car hire desks, ATMs, currency exchange services, public phones, and free Wi-Fi.\n*'''Eating''': Restaurants, caf\u00e9s, fast food outlets, and two bars.\n*'''Shopping''': Souvenir items, bookshops, duty-free perfume, liquor and emeralds, pharmacy, sporting apparel and equipment, electronic devices\n*'''Baggage''': Airlines offer baggage claim offices for passengers who have lost their luggage.\n*'''Parking''': There is a large parking area in front of the terminal.\n*'''Hotels''': There is a Hotel named GHL comfort at 3rd level of airport where one can stay.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n[[File:Cartafueyu de los vuelos dende Cali.svg|thumb|Map of domestic flights.]]\n\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport:\n\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[Albatros Airlines]] | [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o Caribbean International Airport|Porlamar]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]]\n| [[Avianca]] | [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport|Cartagena]], [[Madrid-Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medell\u00edn\u2013JMC]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[John F.

include:\n* Redness or bleeding of gums while brushing [[tooth|teeth]], using [[dental floss]] or biting into hard food (e.g., apples) (though this may occur even in gingivitis, where there is no attachment loss)\n* Gum swelling that recurs\n* Spitting out blood after brushing teeth\n* [[Halitosis]], or bad breath, and a persistent metallic taste in the mouth\n* Gingival recession, resulting in apparent lengthening of teeth. (This may also be caused by heavy-handed brushing or with a stiff toothbrush.)\n* Deep pockets between the teeth and the gums ([[gingival and periodontal pockets|pockets]] are sites where the attachment has been gradually destroyed by [[collagen]]-destroying enzymes, known as [[collagenases]])\n* Loose teeth, in the later stages (though this may occur for other [[occlusal trauma|reasons]], as well)\n\nPeople should realize gingival inflammation and bone destruction are largely painless.  Hence, people may wrongly assume painless bleeding after teeth cleaning is insignificant, although this may be a symptom of progressing periodontitis in that person.\n\n===Associated conditions===\nPeriodontitis has been linked to increased [[inflammation]] in the body, such as indicated by raised levels of [[C-reactive protein]] and [[interleukin-6]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Aiuto F, Parkar M, Andreou G, Suvan J, Brett PM, Ready D, Tonetti MS | title = Periodontitis and systemic inflammation: control of the local infection is associated with a reduction in serum inflammatory markers | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 156\u201360 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14742655 | doi = 10.1177/154405910408300214 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nibali L, D'Aiuto F, Griffiths G, Patel K, Suvan J, Tonetti MS | title = Severe periodontitis is associated with systemic inflammation and a dysmetabolic status: a case-control study | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 931\u20137 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17877746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2007.01133.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paraskevas S, Huizinga JD, Loos BG | title = A systematic review and meta-analyses on C-reactive protein in relation to periodontitis | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 277\u201390 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18294231 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2007.01173.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Aiuto F, Ready D, Tonetti MS | title = Periodontal disease and C-reactive protein-associated cardiovascular risk | journal = Journal of Periodontal Research | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 236\u201341 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15206916 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0765.2004.00731.x }}</ref> It is associated with an increased risk of [[stroke]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Jousilahti P, Paju S, Tuomilehto J | title = Systemic exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis predicts incident stroke | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 222\u20138 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 16872615 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2006.06.027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Rissanen H, Reunanen A, Asikainen S, Knekt P | title = Antibodies to periodontal pathogens and stroke risk | journal = Stroke | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 2020\u20133 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15232116 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000136148.29490.fe | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[myocardial infarction]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Tuomilehto J, Asikainen S, Jousilahti P | title = High serum antibody levels to Porphyromonas gingivalis predict myocardial infarction | journal = European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 408\u201311 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15616414 | doi = 10.1097/01.hjr.0000129745.38217.39 }}</ref> [[atherosclerosis]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford PJ, Gemmell E, Timms P, Chan A, Preston FM, Seymour GJ | title = Anti-P. gingivalis response correlates with atherosclerosis | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 35\u201340 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17189460 | doi = 10.1177/154405910708600105 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck JD, Eke P, Heiss G, Madianos P, Couper D, Lin D, Moss K, Elter J, Offenbacher S | title = Periodontal disease and coronary heart disease: a reappraisal of the exposure | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201324 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15983248 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.511998 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scannapieco FA, Bush RB, Paju S | title = Associations between periodontal disease and risk for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

This is a standard treatment to prevent any further progress of established periodontitis.  Studies show that after such a professional cleaning (periodontal debridement), microbial plaque tends to grow back to precleaning levels after about three to four months.  Nonetheless, the continued stabilization of a person's periodontal state depends largely, if not primarily, on the person's oral hygiene at home, as well as on the go.  Without daily [[oral hygiene]], periodontal disease will not be overcome, especially if the person has a history of extensive periodontal disease.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Management==\n[[File:Generalized perio -touched up.jpg|thumb|right|This section from a panoramic [[radiograph|X-ray film]] depicts the teeth of the lower left quadrant, exhibiting generalized severe bone loss of 30\u201380%.

Finally, the ''peach oval'', to the left, highlights the aggressive nature with which periodontal disease generally affects mandibular incisors.

The ''split in the red line'' depicts varying densities of bone that contribute to a vague region of definitive bone height.]]\n\nThe cornerstone of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent [[oral hygiene]].  This includes twice-daily [[toothbrush|brushing]] with daily [[flossing]].  Also, the use of an [[interdental brush]] is helpful if space between the teeth allows. For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with soft rubber bristles provide excellent manual cleaning.  Persons with dexterity problems, such as [[arthritis]], may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush.  Persons with periodontitis must realize it is a chronic inflammatory disease and a lifelong regimen of excellent hygiene and professional maintenance care with a dentist/hygienist or [[periodontist]] is required to maintain affected teeth.\n\n===Initial therapy===\nRemoval of microbial plaque and calculus is necessary to establish periodontal health.  The first step in the treatment of periodontitis involves nonsurgical cleaning below the gumline with a procedure called \"root surface instrumentation\" or \"RSI\", this causes a mechanical disturbance to the bacterial biofilm below the gumline.<ref name=\"dental-update.co.uk\"/> This procedure involves the use of specialized curettes to mechanically remove plaque and calculus from below the gumline, and may require multiple visits and [[local anesthesia]] to adequately complete.  In addition to initial RSI, it may also be necessary to adjust the occlusion (bite) to prevent excessive force on teeth that have reduced bone support.  Also, it may be necessary to complete any other dental needs, such as replacement of rough, plaque-retentive restorations, closure of open contacts between teeth, and any other requirements diagnosed at the initial evaluation. It is important to note that RSI is different to [[scaling and root planing]]: RSI only removes the [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]], while scaling and root planing removes the calculus as well as underlying softened [[dentin]]e, which leaves behind a smooth and glassy surface, which is not a requiste for periodontal healing. Therefore, RSI is now advocated over root planing.<ref name=\"dental-update.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Reevaluation===\nNonsurgical [[scaling and root planing]] are usually successful if the periodontal pockets are shallower than {{convert|4|\u2013|5|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stambaugh RV, Dragoo M, Smith DM, Carasali L | title = The limits of subgingival scaling | journal = The International Journal of Periodontics & Restorative Dentistry | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 30\u201341 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7047434 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waerhaug J | title = Healing of the dento-epithelial junction following subgingival plaque control.

Probing should be avoided then, and an analysis by gingival index should determine the presence or absence of inflammation. The monthly reevaluation of periodontal therapy should involve periodontal charting as a better indication of the success of treatment, and to see if other courses of treatment can be identified.  Pocket depths of greater than {{convert|5|\u2013|6|mm|abbr=on}} which remain after initial therapy, with bleeding upon probing, indicate continued active disease and will very likely lead to further bone loss over time.  This is especially true in [[molar (tooth)|molar]] tooth sites where [[Furcation defect|furcations]] (areas between the roots) have been exposed.\n\n===Surgery===\nIf nonsurgical therapy is found to have been unsuccessful in managing signs of disease activity, periodontal [[surgery]] may be needed to stop progressive bone loss and regenerate lost bone where possible.  Many surgical approaches are used in the treatment of advanced periodontitis, including open flap debridement and osseous surgery, as well as guided tissue regeneration and bone grafting.  The goal of periodontal surgery is access for definitive calculus removal and surgical management of bony irregularities which have resulted from the disease process to reduce pockets as much as possible.  Long-term studies have shown, in moderate to advanced periodontitis, surgically treated cases often have less further breakdown over time and, when coupled with a regular post-treatment maintenance regimen, are successful in nearly halting tooth loss in nearly 85% of diagnosed people.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaldahl WB, Kalkwarf KL, Patil KD, Molvar MP, Dyer JK | title = Long-term evaluation of periodontal therapy: II.

This involves regular checkups and detailed cleanings every three months to prevent repopulation of periodontitis-causing microorganisms, and to closely monitor affected teeth so early treatment can be rendered if the disease recurs. Usually, periodontal disease exists due to poor plaque control, therefore if the brushing techniques are not modified, a periodontal recurrence is probable.\n\n=== Other ===\n\nMost alternative \"at-home\" gum disease treatments involve injecting antimicrobial solutions, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], into periodontal pockets via slender applicators or oral irrigators.  This process disrupts anaerobic micro-organism colonies and is effective at reducing infections and inflammation when used daily.  A number of other products, functionally equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, are commercially available, but at substantially higher cost.  However, such treatments do not address calculus formations, and so are short-lived, as anaerobic microbial colonies quickly regenerate in and around calculus.\n\n[[Doxycycline]] may be given [[Adjuvant therapy|alongside the primary therapy]] of scaling (see [[#Initial therapy|\u00a7 initial therapy]]).<ref name=\"caton2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Caton J, Ryan ME | title = Clinical studies on the management of periodontal diseases utilizing subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD) | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 114\u201320 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21182947 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.12.003 }}</ref> Doxycycline has been shown to improve indicators of disease progression (namely probing depth and attachment level).<ref name=\"caton2011\" /> Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (such as collagenase), which degrade the teeth's supporting tissues ([[periodontium]]) under inflammatory conditions.<ref name=\"caton2011\" /> To avoid killing beneficial [[Oral microbiology|oral microbes]], only small doses of doxycycline (20&nbsp;mg) are used.<ref name=\"caton2011\" />\n\n==Prognosis==\nDentists and dental hygienists measure periodontal disease using a device called a [[periodontal probe]].  This thin \"measuring stick\" is gently placed into the space between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline.  If the probe can slip more than {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} below the gumline, the person is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred.  This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket.  However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the person, with a toothbrush) if they are 3&nbsp;mm or less in depth.  This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3&nbsp;mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought.  When the pocket depths reach {{convert|6|to|7|mm|abbr=on}} in depth, the hand instruments and ultrasonic scalers used by the dental professionals may not reach deeply enough into the pocket to clean out the microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth.  An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the person to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as [[minocycline]]) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3&nbsp;mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the person at home with his or her toothbrush.\n\nIf people have 7-mm or deeper pockets around their teeth, then they would likely risk eventual tooth loss over the years.  If this periodontal condition is not identified and people remain unaware of the progressive nature of the disease, then years later, they may be surprised that some teeth will gradually become loose and may need to be extracted, sometimes due to a severe infection or even pain.\n\nAccording to the [[Sri Lanka]]n tea laborer study, in the absence of any oral hygiene activity, approximately 10% will suffer from severe periodontal disease with rapid loss of attachment (>2&nbsp;mm/year). About 80% will suffer from moderate loss (1\u20132&nbsp;mm/year) and the remaining 10% will not suffer any loss.<!--\n  --><ref name=\"JclinPeriodontol1995-Preus\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Preus HR, Anerud A, Boysen H, Dunford RG, Zambon JJ, L\u00f6e H | title = The natural history of periodontal disease.

include:\n* Redness or bleeding of gums while brushing [[tooth|teeth]], using [[dental floss]] or biting into hard food (e.g., apples) (though this may occur even in gingivitis, where there is no attachment loss)\n* Gum swelling that recurs\n* Spitting out blood after brushing teeth\n* [[Halitosis]], or bad breath, and a persistent metallic taste in the mouth\n* Gingival recession, resulting in apparent lengthening of teeth. (This may also be caused by heavy-handed brushing or with a stiff toothbrush.)\n* Deep pockets between the teeth and the gums ([[gingival and periodontal pockets|pockets]] are sites where the attachment has been gradually destroyed by [[collagen]]-destroying enzymes, known as [[collagenases]])\n* Loose teeth, in the later stages (though this may occur for other [[occlusal trauma|reasons]], as well)\n\nPeople should realize gingival inflammation and bone destruction are largely painless.  Hence, people may wrongly assume painless bleeding after teeth cleaning is insignificant, although this may be a symptom of progressing periodontitis in that person.\n\n===Associated conditions===\nPeriodontitis has been linked to increased [[inflammation]] in the body, such as indicated by raised levels of [[C-reactive protein]] and [[interleukin-6]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Aiuto F, Parkar M, Andreou G, Suvan J, Brett PM, Ready D, Tonetti MS | title = Periodontitis and systemic inflammation: control of the local infection is associated with a reduction in serum inflammatory markers | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 156\u201360 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14742655 | doi = 10.1177/154405910408300214 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nibali L, D'Aiuto F, Griffiths G, Patel K, Suvan J, Tonetti MS | title = Severe periodontitis is associated with systemic inflammation and a dysmetabolic status: a case-control study | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 931\u20137 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17877746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2007.01133.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paraskevas S, Huizinga JD, Loos BG | title = A systematic review and meta-analyses on C-reactive protein in relation to periodontitis | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 277\u201390 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18294231 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2007.01173.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Aiuto F, Ready D, Tonetti MS | title = Periodontal disease and C-reactive protein-associated cardiovascular risk | journal = Journal of Periodontal Research | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 236\u201341 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15206916 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0765.2004.00731.x }}</ref> It is associated with an increased risk of [[stroke]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Jousilahti P, Paju S, Tuomilehto J | title = Systemic exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis predicts incident stroke | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 222\u20138 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 16872615 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2006.06.027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Rissanen H, Reunanen A, Asikainen S, Knekt P | title = Antibodies to periodontal pathogens and stroke risk | journal = Stroke | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 2020\u20133 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15232116 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000136148.29490.fe | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[myocardial infarction]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pussinen PJ, Alfthan G, Tuomilehto J, Asikainen S, Jousilahti P | title = High serum antibody levels to Porphyromonas gingivalis predict myocardial infarction | journal = European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 408\u201311 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15616414 | doi = 10.1097/01.hjr.0000129745.38217.39 }}</ref> [[atherosclerosis]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford PJ, Gemmell E, Timms P, Chan A, Preston FM, Seymour GJ | title = Anti-P. gingivalis response correlates with atherosclerosis | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 35\u201340 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17189460 | doi = 10.1177/154405910708600105 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck JD, Eke P, Heiss G, Madianos P, Couper D, Lin D, Moss K, Elter J, Offenbacher S | title = Periodontal disease and coronary heart disease: a reappraisal of the exposure | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201324 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15983248 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.511998 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scannapieco FA, Bush RB, Paju S | title = Associations between periodontal disease and risk for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

Because their roots are generally situated very close to each other, with minimal [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|interproximal]] bone, and because of their location in the mouth, where plaque and calculus accumulation is greatest because of the pooling of [[saliva]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} mandibular anteriors suffer excessively.  The ''split in the red line'' depicts varying densities of bone that contribute to a vague region of definitive bone height.]]\n\nThe cornerstone of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent [[oral hygiene]].  This includes twice-daily [[toothbrush|brushing]] with daily [[flossing]].  Also, the use of an [[interdental brush]] is helpful if space between the teeth allows. For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with soft rubber bristles provide excellent manual cleaning.  Persons with dexterity problems, such as [[arthritis]], may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush.  Persons with periodontitis must realize it is a chronic inflammatory disease and a lifelong regimen of excellent hygiene and professional maintenance care with a dentist/hygienist or [[periodontist]] is required to maintain affected teeth.\n\n===Initial therapy===\nRemoval of microbial plaque and calculus is necessary to establish periodontal health.  The first step in the treatment of periodontitis involves nonsurgical cleaning below the gumline with a procedure called \"root surface instrumentation\" or \"RSI\", this causes a mechanical disturbance to the bacterial biofilm below the gumline.<ref name=\"dental-update.co.uk\"/> This procedure involves the use of specialized curettes to mechanically remove plaque and calculus from below the gumline, and may require multiple visits and [[local anesthesia]] to adequately complete.  In addition to initial RSI, it may also be necessary to adjust the occlusion (bite) to prevent excessive force on teeth that have reduced bone support.  Also, it may be necessary to complete any other dental needs, such as replacement of rough, plaque-retentive restorations, closure of open contacts between teeth, and any other requirements diagnosed at the initial evaluation. It is important to note that RSI is different to [[scaling and root planing]]: RSI only removes the [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]], while scaling and root planing removes the calculus as well as underlying softened [[dentin]]e, which leaves behind a smooth and glassy surface, which is not a requiste for periodontal healing. Therefore, RSI is now advocated over root planing.<ref name=\"dental-update.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Reevaluation===\nNonsurgical [[scaling and root planing]] are usually successful if the periodontal pockets are shallower than {{convert|4|\u2013|5|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stambaugh RV, Dragoo M, Smith DM, Carasali L | title = The limits of subgingival scaling | journal = The International Journal of Periodontics & Restorative Dentistry | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 30\u201341 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7047434 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waerhaug J | title = Healing of the dento-epithelial junction following subgingival plaque control.

Probing should be avoided then, and an analysis by gingival index should determine the presence or absence of inflammation. The monthly reevaluation of periodontal therapy should involve periodontal charting as a better indication of the success of treatment, and to see if other courses of treatment can be identified.  Pocket depths of greater than {{convert|5|\u2013|6|mm|abbr=on}} which remain after initial therapy, with bleeding upon probing, indicate continued active disease and will very likely lead to further bone loss over time.  This is especially true in [[molar (tooth)|molar]] tooth sites where [[Furcation defect|furcations]] (areas between the roots) have been exposed.\n\n===Surgery===\nIf nonsurgical therapy is found to have been unsuccessful in managing signs of disease activity, periodontal [[surgery]] may be needed to stop progressive bone loss and regenerate lost bone where possible.  Many surgical approaches are used in the treatment of advanced periodontitis, including open flap debridement and osseous surgery, as well as guided tissue regeneration and bone grafting.  The goal of periodontal surgery is access for definitive calculus removal and surgical management of bony irregularities which have resulted from the disease process to reduce pockets as much as possible.  Long-term studies have shown, in moderate to advanced periodontitis, surgically treated cases often have less further breakdown over time and, when coupled with a regular post-treatment maintenance regimen, are successful in nearly halting tooth loss in nearly 85% of diagnosed people.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaldahl WB, Kalkwarf KL, Patil KD, Molvar MP, Dyer JK | title = Long-term evaluation of periodontal therapy: II.

This involves regular checkups and detailed cleanings every three months to prevent repopulation of periodontitis-causing microorganisms, and to closely monitor affected teeth so early treatment can be rendered if the disease recurs. Usually, periodontal disease exists due to poor plaque control, therefore if the brushing techniques are not modified, a periodontal recurrence is probable.\n\n=== Other ===\n\nMost alternative \"at-home\" gum disease treatments involve injecting antimicrobial solutions, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], into periodontal pockets via slender applicators or oral irrigators.  This process disrupts anaerobic micro-organism colonies and is effective at reducing infections and inflammation when used daily.  A number of other products, functionally equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, are commercially available, but at substantially higher cost.  However, such treatments do not address calculus formations, and so are short-lived, as anaerobic microbial colonies quickly regenerate in and around calculus.\n\n[[Doxycycline]] may be given [[Adjuvant therapy|alongside the primary therapy]] of scaling (see [[#Initial therapy|\u00a7 initial therapy]]).<ref name=\"caton2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Caton J, Ryan ME | title = Clinical studies on the management of periodontal diseases utilizing subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD) | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 114\u201320 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21182947 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.12.003 }}</ref> Doxycycline has been shown to improve indicators of disease progression (namely probing depth and attachment level).<ref name=\"caton2011\" /> Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (such as collagenase), which degrade the teeth's supporting tissues ([[periodontium]]) under inflammatory conditions.<ref name=\"caton2011\" /> To avoid killing beneficial [[Oral microbiology|oral microbes]], only small doses of doxycycline (20&nbsp;mg) are used.<ref name=\"caton2011\" />\n\n==Prognosis==\nDentists and dental hygienists measure periodontal disease using a device called a [[periodontal probe]].  This thin \"measuring stick\" is gently placed into the space between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline.  If the probe can slip more than {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} below the gumline, the person is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred.  This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket.  However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the person, with a toothbrush) if they are 3&nbsp;mm or less in depth.  This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3&nbsp;mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought.  When the pocket depths reach {{convert|6|to|7|mm|abbr=on}} in depth, the hand instruments and ultrasonic scalers used by the dental professionals may not reach deeply enough into the pocket to clean out the microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth.  An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the person to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as [[minocycline]]) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3&nbsp;mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the person at home with his or her toothbrush.\n\nIf people have 7-mm or deeper pockets around their teeth, then they would likely risk eventual tooth loss over the years.  If this periodontal condition is not identified and people remain unaware of the progressive nature of the disease, then years later, they may be surprised that some teeth will gradually become loose and may need to be extracted, sometimes due to a severe infection or even pain.\n\nAccording to the [[Sri Lanka]]n tea laborer study, in the absence of any oral hygiene activity, approximately 10% will suffer from severe periodontal disease with rapid loss of attachment (>2&nbsp;mm/year). About 80% will suffer from moderate loss (1\u20132&nbsp;mm/year) and the remaining 10% will not suffer any loss.<!--\n  --><ref name=\"JclinPeriodontol1995-Preus\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Preus HR, Anerud A, Boysen H, Dunford RG, Zambon JJ, L\u00f6e H | title = The natural history of periodontal disease.

In the following year construction began on the original Collins [[chairlift]], fashioned from a surplus mining ore tramway system that featured a clamp-cam bullwheel gripping a metal cable strung with single-seat chairs. It was the second such chairlift in the United States, after [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]].

The resort began adding a developed [[snowmaking]] infrastructure in 1996, and the ski area continues to develop and refine the process. The late 1990s and early 2000s were marked with further modernization. In 1999 the Sunnyside lift was replaced with a detachable triple chair, the resort's first [[detachable chairlift]]. Two years later the Supreme chair was upgraded to a triple, and the Sugarloaf chair was replaced with a detachable quad. During the 2007\u201308 season, Alta introduced a new Axess [[RFID]] electronic [[lift ticket]] system, similar to that of the [[Solitude Ski Resort]]. During the 2008\u201309 season, Alta added a conveyor system at the start point of the Supreme lift that assists skiers in getting on the fixed-triple lift and allows the lift to operate at a faster speed by speeding the loading process. Alta added safety bars to the Sunnyside lift in 2010 and to the Collins, Sugarloaf, and Supreme chairs in the summer of 2011. The most recent lift development was in the 2017\u201318 season, when [[Leitner-Poma]] built a high speed quad that replaced the former Supreme and Cecret lifts, extending from the Sugarloaf base area to the top terminal of the former Supreme lift. The ski area is in the process of planning for the next several years. Many of the decisions will be made as the Mountain Accord process evolves. This involves a tram to the top of Mt.

(The offer is open to skiers only, as a result of Alta's skiers-only policy; Snowbird allows snowboarders.)\n\n===Chairlifts and tow ropes===\n[[Image:AltaPano.jpg|thumb|right|Summit of Point Supreme]]\n{|\n|\n*Collins Lift\n*Sugarloaf Lift\n*Sunnyside Lift\n*Supreme Lift\n|\n*Wildcat Lift\n*Albion Lift\n*Rustler Lift (for Alta's Rustler Lodge)\n*Snowpine Lift (for Snowpine Lodge)\n|\n*Transfer Tow\n*Little Grizzly Carpet\n|}\n\n===Terrain aspects===\n* North: 53%\n* East: 17%\n* West: 29%\n* South: 1%\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|last1=ZRankings|first1=Top Ski Resorts|title=ZRankings Topographical Survey, Ski Terrain at Alta|url=https://zrankings.com/resort/show?id=4-alta-ski-area|website=ZRankings|publisher=ZRankings|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Shrontz, Duane (1989) ''Alta: a people's story'' Alta Ski Lifts Corp {{OCLC|20835855}}\n* Asmus, Brad (1993) ''Powder Hound's Guide to Skiing Alta'' {{ISBN|0-9631113-0-2}}\n* Engen, Alan (1998) ''For the Love of Skiing: A Visual History'' {{ISBN|0879058676}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alta Ski Area}}\n*{{official website|http://www.alta.com}}\n*[http://www.altacam.com AltaCam] \u2013 Alta Skiing Info est. 1996\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205040133/http://www.fourmilepress.com/about.htm Alta Skiing Guide Book] \u2013 The Powder Hound's Guide to Skiing Alta, a 160-page guide book that describes each of the important runs on one of the most challenging mountains in alpine skiing.\n*[http://skilifts.org/old/ut-alta.htm Ski Lifts.org] \u2013 Alta \u2013 current and removed lifts\n\n{{Ski areas and resorts in Utah}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Salt Lake County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Ski areas and resorts in Utah]]\n[[Category:Utah culture]]\n[[Category:Event venues established in 1939]]\n[[Category:Wasatch Range]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Utah]]\n", "name_user": "Firetoss", "label": "safe", "comment": "COVID 19 Update", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Ski_Area"}
