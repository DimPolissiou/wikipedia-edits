She was the fleet mate of both the {{RMS|Olympic}} and the {{RMS|Titanic}} and was intended to enter service as a [[Transatlantic crossings|transatlantic]] [[passenger liner]].\n\n''Britannic'' was launched just before the start of the [[First World War]]. She was designed to be the safest of the three ships with design changes actioned during construction due to lessons learned from the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']]. She was laid up at her builders, [[Harland and Wolff]], in [[Belfast]] for many months before being put to use as a [[hospital ship]] in 1915. In 1915 and 1916 she served between the United Kingdom and the [[Dardanelles]]. On the morning of 21 November 1916 she was shaken by an explosion caused by a [[naval mine]] of the [[Imperial German Navy]] near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] and sank 55 minutes later, killing 30 people.\n\nThere were 1,065 people on board; the 1,035 survivors were rescued from the water and [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest ship lost in the First World War. The loss of the ship was compensated by the award of [[RMS Majestic (1914)|SS ''Bismarck'']] to the White Star Line as part of [[World War I reparations|postwar reparations]]; she became the RMS ''Majestic''.\n\nThe wreck was located and explored by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] in 1975. The vessel is the largest passenger ship on the sea floor.''<ref name=MC275>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=275}}.</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe dimensions of ''Britannic'' were similar to those of her sister ships, but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the ''Titanic'' disaster. With a gross tonnage of 48,158, she surpassed her sisters in terms of size (volume), but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time; the German [[SS Leviathan|SS ''Vaterland'']] held this title with a significantly higher tonnage.<ref name=MC217>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=217}}.</ref>\n\nThe ship was propelled by a mixed system already tested on her sisters: two triple expansion steam engines powered the three-bladed outboard wing screws while a steam turbine used steam exhausted from the two reciprocating engines to power the central four-bladed [[propeller|screws]] giving a maximum speed of 23 knots.<ref name=MC231>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=231}}.</ref>\n\n=== Post-''Titanic'' design changes ===\nHMHS Britannic was in character and layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of ''Titanic'' and the subsequent inquiries, several design changes were made to the remaining ''Olympic''-class liners. With ''Britannic'', these changes were made before launch. The final design allowed the ship to retain its signature features such as the iconic funnel layout, however, the changes included increasing the ship's beam to {{convert|94|ft|m}} to allow for a [[double hull]] along the engine and [[boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]], and raising six out of the 15 watertight bulkheads up to B Deck. Additionally, a higher rated {{convert|18000|hp|lk=in}} turbine was added instead of the previous two vessels' {{convert|16000|hp}} ones, to make up for the increase in hull width. The central watertight compartments were enhanced, allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded.<ref name=MC220>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=220}}.</ref>\n\nA more obvious external change was the fitting of large [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like [[davit]]s, each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] which were stored on gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually-operated [[Axel Welin|Welin]]-type davits as on ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic''.<ref name=MC224>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=224}}.</ref><ref name=Piouffre307>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=307}}.</ref>\n\nAdditional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof, and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship, providing that none of the [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] was obstructing the way. This design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a [[Angle of list|list]] that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. Several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose.<ref name=\"Bonsall\">{{cite book\n| last = Bonsall\n| first = Thomas E.\n| title = Titanic\n| year = 1987\n| publisher = Bookman Publishing\n| location = Baltimore, Maryland\n| isbn = 978-0-8317-8774-5\n| page = 54\n| chapter = 8\n}}</ref> The ship carried 55 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.\n\nBuilt and designed as an ocean liner, the ''Britannic's'' layout was not ideal for its use as a [[hospital ship]]. After the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out the ship was requisitioned by the UK government and temporary changes were made to allow the ship to be fit for purpose. Most of the furnishings that were due to be fitted were stored in a warehouse as the ship was expected to - after the war - be converted into a [[White Star Line]] ocean liner. Due to the ship's unfortunate fate, the ship never sailed as an ocean liner and the furnishings of the ''Britannic'' were sold. There are homes in Belfast who bought and fitted the Britannic's staircases and signature [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] style fittings.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Conception ===\nIn 1907, [[J. Bruce Ismay]], director general of the [[White Star Line]], and [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], chairman of the [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard in [[Belfast]], decided to build a trio of ocean liners of unmatched size to compete with the Cunard Line's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']] not in terms of speed but in terms of luxury and safety.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=12}} The names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size: ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic''.<ref name=\"Piouffre41\">{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=41}}</ref> The plan to build these three ships was realised by naval architects [[Thomas Andrews]] and [[Alexander Carlisle]].\n\nConstruction of the ''Olympic'' and the ''Titanic'' began in 1908 and 1909 respectively.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=19}} Their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the [[Arrol Gantry]] to shelter them, wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=14}} In 1915, four coastal-bombardment monitors were built simultaneously beneath it. The three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of 48,000. Their designed speed was approximately 22 knots, well below that of the ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'', but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=18}}\n\n=== Rumoured name-change ===\nAlthough the White Star Line and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard always denied it,<ref name=\"Bonsall\" /><ref name=\"name_dispute\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ocean-liners.com/ships/britannic.asp |title=HMHS Britannic |publisher=ocean-liners.com |accessdate=12 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219001335/http://www.ocean-liners.com/ships/britannic.asp |archivedate=19 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> some sources claim that the ship was to be named ''Gigantic''.<ref name=\"britannic_name\">{{cite book |last1=Bonner |first1=Kit |last2=Bonner |first2=Carolyn |title=Great Ship Disasters |page=60 |location= |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |year=2003 |isbn=0-7603-1336-9}}</ref>{{sfnp|Lynch|2012|page=161}} One source is a poster of the ship with the name ''Gigantic'' at the top.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturyliners.com/wsl_britannic_gallery.htm |title=White Star Line |publisher=20thcenturyliners.com |accessdate=14 July 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624131511/http://www.20thcenturyliners.com/wsl_britannic_gallery.htm |archivedate=24 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other sources are November 1911 American newspapers stating the White Star order for ''Gigantic'' being placed.<ref>[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99062034/1911-11-27/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1911&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=Titanic&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=8&state=&date2=1911&proxtext=Titanic&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=4 The Madison Daily Leader] November 27, 1911..Retrieved October 4, 2018</ref><ref>[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92070417/1911-11-21/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1911&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=Titanic&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=16&state=&date2=1911&proxtext=Titanic&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3  Las Vegas Optic:\"1,000 FOOT SHIP MAY DOCK IN NEW YORK], November 21, 1911..Retrieved October 4, 2018</ref> According to Simon Mills, owner of the ''Britannic'' wreck, a copy of the Harland and Wolff order book held by the [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]] (PRONI Ref: D2805/SHIP/1) dated October 1911 (about six months before the ''Titanic'' disaster) already shows the name ''Britannic''.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nTom McCluskie stated that in his capacity as archive manager and historian at Harland and Wolff, he \"never saw any official reference to the name 'Gigantic' being used or proposed for the third of the Olympic class vessels\".<ref name=\"Milford\">[http://www.jmilford-titanic.com/2013/10/what-happened-to-gigantic.html Joshua Milford: ''What happened to Gigantic?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305141359/http://www.jmilford-titanic.com/2013/10/what-happened-to-gigantic.html |date=5 March 2016 }} Website viewed 9 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"Chirnside\">[http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/Gigantic_Dossier.html Mark Chirnside: ''Gigantic Dossier''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204908/http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/Gigantic_Dossier.html |date=3 March 2016 }} Website viewed 1 May 2012</ref> Some hand-written changes were added to the order book and dated January 1912.

In August 1914, before ''Britannic'' could commence transatlantic service between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Southampton]], the [[World War I|First World War]] began. Immediately, all [[shipyard]]s with [[Admiralty]] contracts were given priority to use available raw materials. All civil contracts including the ''Britannic'' were slowed. The naval authorities [[requisitioned]] a large number of ships as [[armed merchant cruiser]]s or for troop transport. The Admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high. The big ocean liners were not taken for naval use, because smaller ships were easier to operate. RMS ''Olympic'' returned to Belfast on 3 November 1914, while work on ''Britannic'' continued slowly.<ref name=MC240>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=240}}.</ref>\n\n=== Requisition ===\n[[File:RMS Britannic (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Artist's conception of ''Britannic'' in her intended White Star livery]]\n[[File:HMHS Galeka and the HMHS Britannic.jpg|thumb|''Britannic'' with [[SS Galeka|HMHS ''Galeka'']], taking on board the wounded at Mudros]]\nThe need for increased tonnage grew critical as naval operations extended to the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. In May 1915, ''Britannic'' completed mooring trials of her engines, and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks' notice. The same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when Cunard's {{RMS|Lusitania}} was torpedoed near the Irish coast by {{SMU|U-20|Germany|6}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Le Goff|1998|p=50}}</ref>\n\nThe following month, the Admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as [[troop transport]]s in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] (also called the [[Dardanelles]] service). The first to sail were Cunard's {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}} and {{RMS|Aquitania}}. As the Gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted, the need for large [[hospital ship]]s for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident. RMS ''Aquitania'' was diverted to hospital ship duties in August (her place as a troop transport would be taken by RMS ''Olympic'' in September). Then on 13 November 1915, ''Britannic'' was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at Belfast.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nRepainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe, she was renamed HMHS (His Majesty's Hospital Ship) ''Britannic''<ref name=\"MC240\" /> and placed under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Charles Alfred Bartlett]] (1868\u20131945).<ref name=MC241>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=241}}.</ref> In the interior, 3,309 beds and several operating rooms were installed. The common areas of the upper decks were transformed into rooms for the wounded. The cabins of B Deck were used to house doctors. The first-class dining room and the first-class reception room on D Deck were transformed into operating rooms.

At six o'clock, the patients were awakened and the premises were cleaned up. Breakfast was served at 6:30 AM, then the captain toured the ship for an inspection. Lunch was served at 12:30 PM and tea at 4:30 PM. Patients were treated between meals and those who wished to go for a walk could do so.

Unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that, although the ship could still send out transmissions by radio, she could no longer receive them.<ref name=MC256>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=256}}.</ref>\n\nAlong with the damaged watertight door of the firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. ''Britannic'' had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising all the way up to B Deck.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=261}} Those measures had been taken after the ''Titanic'' disaster (''Titanic'' could float with only her first four compartments flooded). The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. There were open [[porthole]]s along the front lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards, against standing orders. As the ship's [[angle of list]] increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, ''Britannic'' could not stay afloat.<ref name=hublots>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=258}}.</ref>\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nOn the bridge, Captain Bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, ''Britannic'' was roughly in the same condition ''Titanic'' had been in one hour after the collision with the [[iceberg]]. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, ''Britannic'' quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island [[Kea (island)|Kea]] to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in an attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the [[rudder]] made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. The captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.<ref name=MC257>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=257}}.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the hospital staff prepared to evacuate. Bartlett had given the order to prepare the lifeboats, but he did not allow them to be lowered into the water. Everyone took their most valuable belongings with them before they evacuated. The chaplain of the ship recovered his Bible. The few patients and nurses on board were assembled. Major Harold Priestley gathered his detachments from the Royal Army Medical Corps to the back of the A deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind.<ref name=MC257 />\n\nWhile Bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre, the ship listed more and more. The other crew members began to fear that the list would become too large, and so they decided to put the first lifeboat onto the water without waiting for the order to do so.<ref name=MC257 /> Bartlett then decided to stop the ship and her engine. Before he could do so, two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side. The still-turning partly-surfaced propeller sucked the two lifeboats into it, mincing them, along with their passengers.<ref name=hublots /> Bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat.<ref name=MC259>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=259}}.</ref>\n\n==== Final moments ====\n[[File:Britannic sinking.jpg|thumb|HMHS ''Britannic'' sinking]]\nBy 08:45, the list was so great that even the gantry davits were now inoperable. At this point, Bartlett concluded that the rate at which ''Britannic'' was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship.<ref name=MC260>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=260}}.</ref> At 09:00 Bartlett was informed that the rate of flooding had increased due to the ship's forward motion and that the flooding had reached D-deck. Realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time, Bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle, the signal to abandon ship.<ref name=MC261>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=261}}.</ref> As water had already reached the bridge, he and Assistant Commander Dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water, swimming to a collapsible boat from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations.<ref>[http://www.titanic-titanic.com/britannic.shtml \u00ab ''Britannic'' \u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806070941/http://www.titanic-titanic.com/britannic.shtml |date=6 August 2009 }}, ''Titanic-titanic.com.

The results showed that even after 87 years on the bottom of the Kea Channel, ''Britannic'' is in much better condition than ''Titanic'' because the bacteria on her hull have too much competition and are actually helping protect the wreck by turning it into a man-made reef.{{Citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, an expedition, funded and filmed by the History Channel, brought together fourteen skilled divers to help determine what caused the quick sinking of ''Britannic''.<ref name=wreck2 /> After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was kicked up, causing zero visibility conditions, and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on ''Britannic''{{'}}s boiler room, but it was discovered that photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the [[Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities]], a department within the [[Greek Ministry of Culture]]. Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented.

steamships and the second to bear the name ''Britannic''.  She was the fleet mate of both the {{RMS|Olympic}} and the {{RMS|Titanic}} and was intended to enter service as a [[Transatlantic crossings|transatlantic]] [[passenger liner]].\n\n''Britannic'' was launched just before the start of the [[First World War]]. She was designed to be the safest of the three ships with design changes actioned during construction due to lessons learned from the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']]. She was laid up at her builders, [[Harland and Wolff]], in [[Belfast]] for many months before being put to use as a [[hospital ship]] in 1915. In 1915 and 1916 she served between the United Kingdom and the [[Dardanelles]]. On the morning of 21 November 1916 she was shaken by an explosion caused by a [[naval mine]] of the [[Imperial German Navy]] near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] and  foundered 55 minutes later, killing 30 people.\n\nThere were 1,065 people on board; the 1,035 survivors were rescued from the water and [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest ship lost in the First World War. The loss of the ship was compensated by the award of [[RMS Majestic (1914)|SS ''Bismarck'']] to the White Star Line as part of [[World War I reparations|postwar reparations]]; she became the RMS ''Majestic''.\n\nThe wreck was located and explored by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] in 1975. The vessel is the largest passenger ship on the sea floor.''<ref name=MC275>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=275}}.</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe dimensions of ''Britannic'' were similar to those of her sister ships, but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the ''Titanic'' disaster. With a gross tonnage of 48,158, she surpassed her sisters in terms of size (volume), but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time; the German [[SS Leviathan|SS ''Vaterland'']] held this title with a significantly higher tonnage.<ref name=MC217>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=217}}.</ref>\n\nThe ship was propelled by a mixed system already tested on her sisters: two triple expansion steam engines powered the three-bladed outboard wing screws while a steam turbine used steam exhausted from the two reciprocating engines to power the central four-bladed [[propeller|screws]] giving a maximum speed of 23 knots.<ref name=MC231>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=231}}.</ref>\n\n=== Post-''Titanic'' design changes ===\nHMHS Britannic was in character and layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of ''Titanic'' and the subsequent inquiries, several design changes were made to the remaining ''Olympic''-class liners. With ''Britannic'', these changes were made before launch. The final design allowed the ship to retain its signature features such as the iconic funnel layout, however, the changes included increasing the ship's beam to {{convert|94|ft|m}} to allow for a [[double hull]] along the engine and [[boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]], and raising six out of the 15 watertight bulkheads up to B Deck. Additionally, a higher rated {{convert|18000|hp|lk=in}} turbine was added instead of the previous two vessels' {{convert|16000|hp}} ones, to make up for the increase in hull width. The central watertight compartments were enhanced, allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded.<ref name=MC220>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=220}}.</ref>\n\nA more obvious external change was the fitting of large [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like [[davit]]s, each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] which were stored on gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually-operated [[Axel Welin|Welin]]-type davits as on ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic''.<ref name=MC224>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=224}}.</ref><ref name=Piouffre307>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=307}}.</ref>\n\nAdditional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof, and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship, providing that none of the [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] was obstructing the way. This design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a [[Angle of list|list]] that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. Several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose.<ref name=\"Bonsall\">{{cite book\n| last = Bonsall\n| first = Thomas E.\n| title = Titanic\n| year = 1987\n| publisher = Bookman Publishing\n| location = Baltimore, Maryland\n| isbn = 978-0-8317-8774-5\n| page = 54\n| chapter = 8\n}}</ref> The ship carried 55 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.\n\nBuilt and designed as an ocean liner, the ''Britannic's'' layout was not ideal for its use as a [[hospital ship]]. After the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out the ship was requisitioned by the UK government and temporary changes were made to allow the ship to be fit for purpose. Most of the furnishings that were due to be fitted were stored in a warehouse as the ship was expected to - after the war - be converted into a [[White Star Line]] ocean liner. Due to the ship's unfortunate fate, the ship never sailed as an ocean liner and the furnishings of the ''Britannic'' were sold. There are homes in Belfast who bought and fitted the Britannic's staircases and signature [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] style fittings.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Conception ===\nIn 1907, [[J. Bruce Ismay]], director general of the [[White Star Line]], and [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], chairman of the [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard in [[Belfast]], decided to build a trio of ocean liners of unmatched size to compete with the Cunard Line's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']] not in terms of speed but in terms of luxury and safety.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=12}} The names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size: ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic''.<ref name=\"Piouffre41\">{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=41}}</ref> The plan to build these three ships was realised by naval architects [[Thomas Andrews]] and [[Alexander Carlisle]].\n\nConstruction of the ''Olympic'' and the ''Titanic'' began in 1908 and 1909 respectively.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=19}} Their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the [[Arrol Gantry]] to shelter them, wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=14}} In 1915, four coastal-bombardment monitors were built simultaneously beneath it. The three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of 48,000.

In August 1914, before ''Britannic'' could commence transatlantic service between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Southampton]], the [[World War I|First World War]] began. Immediately, all [[shipyard]]s with [[Admiralty]] contracts were given priority to use available raw materials. All civil contracts including the ''Britannic'' were slowed. The naval authorities [[requisitioned]] a large number of ships as [[armed merchant cruiser]]s or for troop transport. The Admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high. The big ocean liners were not taken for naval use, because smaller ships were easier to operate. RMS ''Olympic'' returned to Belfast on 3 November 1914, while work on ''Britannic'' continued slowly.<ref name=MC240>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=240}}.</ref>\n\n=== Requisition ===\n[[File:RMS Britannic (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Artist's conception of ''Britannic'' in her intended White Star livery]]\n[[File:HMHS Galeka and the HMHS Britannic.jpg|thumb|''Britannic'' with [[SS Galeka|HMHS ''Galeka'']], taking on board the wounded at Mudros]]\nThe need for increased tonnage grew critical as naval operations extended to the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. In May 1915, ''Britannic'' completed mooring trials of her engines, and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks' notice. The same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when Cunard's {{RMS|Lusitania}} was torpedoed near the Irish coast by {{SMU|U-20|Germany|6}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Le Goff|1998|p=50}}</ref>\n\nThe following month, the Admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as [[troop transport]]s in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] (also called the [[Dardanelles]] service). The first to sail were Cunard's {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}} and {{RMS|Aquitania}}. As the Gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted, the need for large [[hospital ship]]s for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident. RMS ''Aquitania'' was diverted to hospital ship duties in August (her place as a troop transport would be taken by RMS ''Olympic'' in September). Then on 13 November 1915, ''Britannic'' was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at Belfast.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nRepainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe, she was renamed HMHS (His Majesty's Hospital Ship) ''Britannic''<ref name=\"MC240\" /> and placed under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Charles Alfred Bartlett]] (1868\u20131945).<ref name=MC241>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=241}}.</ref> In the interior, 3,309 beds and several operating rooms were installed. The common areas of the upper decks were transformed into rooms for the wounded. The cabins of B Deck were used to house doctors. The first-class dining room and the first-class reception room on D Deck were transformed into operating rooms.

At six o'clock, the patients were awakened and the premises were cleaned up. Breakfast was served at 6:30 AM, then the captain toured the ship for an inspection.

The seas rose once again just as ''Britannic'' left the port. By next morning, the storms died and the ship passed the [[Strait of Messina]] without problems. [[Cape Matapan]] was rounded in the first hours of 21 November. By morning, ''Britannic'' was steaming at full speed into the [[Kea Channel]], between [[Sounion|Cape Sounion]] (the southernmost point of [[Attica]], the prefecture that includes [[Athens]]) and the island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]].<ref name=MC253 />\n\nThere were 1,066 people on board: 673 crew, 315 [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC), 77 nurses and the captain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hmhsbritannic.weebly.com/sinking.html|title=Sinking|work=Hospital Ship HMHS Britannic|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810003608/http://hmhsbritannic.weebly.com/sinking.html|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Explosion ====\nAt 08:12 on 21 November 1916, a loud explosion shook the ship.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} The cause, whether it was a [[torpedo]] from an enemy submarine or a [[Naval mine|mine]], was not apparent. It would later be revealed that the mines were planted in the Kea Channel on 21 October 1916 by {{ship|SM|U-73}} under the command of [[:de:Gustav Sie\u00df|Gustav Sie\u00df]]. The reaction in the dining room was immediate; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way, as further [[aft]], the power of the explosion was less felt and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat. Captain Bartlett and Chief Officer Hume were on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] at the time and the gravity of the situation was soon evident.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=259}} The explosion was on the [[starboard]]{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=259}} side, between holds two and three. The force of the explosion damaged the watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] between hold one and the [[forecastle|forepeak]].{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} The first four watertight compartments were filling rapidly with water,{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} the [[boiler-man]]'s tunnel connecting the firemen's quarters in the bow with boiler room six was seriously damaged, and water was flowing into that boiler room.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}}\n\nBartlett ordered the watertight doors closed, sent a [[distress signal]], and ordered the crew to prepare the lifeboats.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them HMS ''Scourge'' and HMS ''Heroic'', but ''Britannic'' heard nothing in reply. Unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that, although the ship could still send out transmissions by radio, she could no longer receive them.<ref name=MC256>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=256}}.</ref>\n\nAlong with the damaged watertight door of the firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=260}} Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. ''Britannic'' had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising all the way up to B Deck.{{sfn|Chirnside|2011|p=261}} Those measures had been taken after the ''Titanic'' disaster (''Titanic'' could float with only her first four compartments flooded). The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. There were open [[porthole]]s along the front lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards, against standing orders. As the ship's [[angle of list]] increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, ''Britannic'' could not stay afloat.<ref name=hublots>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=258}}.</ref>\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nOn the bridge, Captain Bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, ''Britannic'' was roughly in the same condition ''Titanic'' had been in one hour after the collision with the [[iceberg]]. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, ''Britannic'' quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island [[Kea (island)|Kea]] to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in an attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the [[rudder]] made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. The captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.<ref name=MC257>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=257}}.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the hospital staff prepared to evacuate. Bartlett had given the order to prepare the lifeboats, but he did not allow them to be lowered into the water. Everyone took their most valuable belongings with them before they evacuated. The chaplain of the ship recovered his Bible. The few patients and nurses on board were assembled. Major Harold Priestley gathered his detachments from the Royal Army Medical Corps to the back of the A deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind.<ref name=MC257 />\n\nWhile Bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre, the ship listed more and more. The other crew members began to fear that the list would become too large, and so they decided to put the first lifeboat onto the water without waiting for the order to do so.<ref name=MC257 /> Bartlett then decided to stop the ship and her engine. Before he could do so, two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side. The still-turning partly-surfaced propeller sucked the two lifeboats into it, mincing them, along with their passengers.<ref name=hublots /> Bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat.<ref name=MC259>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=259}}.</ref>\n\n==== Final moments ====\n[[File:Britannic sinking.jpg|thumb|HMHS ''Britannic'' sinking]]\nBy 08:45, the list was so great that even the gantry davits were now inoperable. At this point, Bartlett concluded that the rate at which ''Britannic'' was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship.<ref name=MC260>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=260}}.</ref> At 09:00 Bartlett was informed that the rate of flooding had increased due to the ship's forward motion and that the flooding had reached D-deck. Realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time, Bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle, the signal to abandon ship.<ref name=MC261>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2011|p=261}}.</ref> As water had already reached the bridge, he and Assistant Commander Dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water, swimming to a collapsible boat from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations.<ref>[http://www.titanic-titanic.com/britannic.shtml \u00ab ''Britannic'' \u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806070941/http://www.titanic-titanic.com/britannic.shtml |date=6 August 2009 }}, ''Titanic-titanic.com.

Diver Rich Stevenson found that several watertight doors were open. It has been suggested that this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of ''[[SM U-73|U-73]]'' that ''Britannic'' was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors.

Divers placed her samples on the ''Britannic'' to look at the colonies of iron-eating bacteria on the wreck, which are responsible for the [[rusticle]]s growing on ''Titanic''. The results showed that even after 87 years on the bottom of the Kea Channel, ''Britannic'' is in much better condition than ''Titanic'' because the bacteria on her hull have too much competition and are actually helping protect the wreck by turning it into a man-made reef.{{Citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, an expedition, funded and filmed by the History Channel, brought together fourteen skilled divers to help determine what caused the quick sinking of ''Britannic''.<ref name=wreck2 /> After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was kicked up, causing zero visibility conditions, and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on ''Britannic''{{'}}s boiler room, but it was discovered that photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the [[Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities]], a department within the [[Greek Ministry of Culture]]. Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented. Underwater Antiquities later recognised the importance of this mission and subsequently extended an invitation to revisit the wreck under less stringent rules. On this expedition, divers found a bulb shape in her expansion joint.

He was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the Dark Side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archieve vault by Emperor Palpatine, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's mask killed some of his personnel, Vader examined it and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build his fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished the build of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the dark side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin would soon meet his demise by being crashed against the wall with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark esence would remain in the mask for years to come and at one point the mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', where it possessed the bodies of two thieves who attempted to rob the ship, forcing the others to abandon them and destroy the ship. Darth Momin appears in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', as well as the 4th issue of ''Lando''.\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Morley}}\n| Voice: [[Benjamin Diskin|Ben Diskin]] (''The Clone Wars'')\n| Snake-like Anacondan that helps Darth Maul survive on the junk world of Lotho Minor.

He later kills his father to prove his allegiance to the dark side, betrays and kills Snoke, becoming the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and forms a special connection with Rey, whom he attempts to seduce to dark side and convince to rule over the galaxy alongside him, but she refuses. Ren later forms an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine and his fleet of Star Destroyers, capable of destroying planets, entitled the Final Order, but is eventually redeemed after a confrontation with Rey, as well as his mother's death and a vision of his father's spirit, and comes to Rey's aid to confront the Emperor, killing the Knights of Ren in the process. After Rey is able to unlock her full potential by summoning the spirits of all Jedi before her and kill Palpatine, she briefly dies, but Ren revives her and the two share a kiss.

In ''The Last Jedi'', she is reluctantly trained by Luke, who fears that she will succumb to the dark side, similarly to Ren, but she later learns of his attempt to kill Ren after sensing the darkness in him and leaves to confront him, believing that there is still good in him. After Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke and works alongside Rey to defeat his guards, Ren offers Rey to join him and rule over the galaxy together, but she refuses and escapes during the destruction of the ''Supremacy''. Rey later briefly takes part in the Battle of Crait, escaping aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst Luke sacrifices himself to face Ren and allow the Resistance to escape.

He was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the Dark Side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archieve vault by Emperor Palpatine, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's mask killed some of his personnel, Vader examined it and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build his fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished the build of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the dark side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin would soon meet his demise by being crashed against the wall with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark esence would remain in the mask for years to come and at one point the mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', where it possessed the bodies of two thieves who attempted to rob the ship, forcing the others to abandon them and destroy the ship. Darth Momin appears in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', as well as the 4th issue of ''Lando''.\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Morley}}\n| Voice: [[Benjamin Diskin|Ben Diskin]] (''The Clone Wars'')\n| Snake-like Anacondan that helps Darth Maul survive on the junk world of Lotho Minor.

He later kills his father to prove his allegiance to the dark side, betrays and kills Snoke, becoming the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and forms a special connection with Rey, whom he attempts to seduce to dark side and convince to rule over the galaxy alongside him, but she refuses. Ren later forms an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine and his fleet of Star Destroyers, capable of destroying planets, entitled the Final Order, but is eventually redeemed after a confrontation with Rey, as well as his mother's death and a vision of his father's spirit, and comes to Rey's aid to confront the Emperor, killing the Knights of Ren in the process. After Rey is able to unlock her full potential by summoning the spirits of all Jedi before her and kill Palpatine, she briefly dies, but Ren revives her and the two share a kiss.

In ''The Last Jedi'', she is reluctantly trained by Luke, who fears that she will succumb to the dark side, similarly to Ren, but she later learns of his attempt to kill Ren after sensing the darkness in him and leaves to confront him, believing that there is still good in him. After Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke and works alongside Rey to defeat his guards, Ren offers Rey to join him and rule over the galaxy together, but she refuses and escapes during the destruction of the ''Supremacy''. Rey later briefly takes part in the Battle of Crait, escaping aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst Luke sacrifices himself to face Ren and allow the Resistance to escape.
