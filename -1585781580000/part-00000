He is perhaps best known as the author of the ''[[Brief Lives]]'', his collection of short biographical pieces. He was a pioneer [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], who recorded (often for the first time) numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England, and who is particularly noted as the discoverer of the [[Avebury]] henge monument. The [[Aubrey holes]] at [[Stonehenge]] are named after him, although there is considerable doubt as to whether the holes that he observed are those that currently bear the name. He was also a pioneer [[Folkloristics|folklorist]], collecting together a [[miscellany]] of material on customs, traditions and beliefs under the title \"Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme\". He set out to compile [[English county histories|county histories]] of both [[Wiltshire]] and [[Surrey]], although both projects remained unfinished. His \"Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum\" (also unfinished) was the first attempt to compile a full-length study of English [[Toponymy|place-names]]. He had wider interests in applied mathematics and astronomy, and was friendly with many of the greatest scientists of the day.\n\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks largely to the popularity of ''Brief Lives'', Aubrey was regarded as little more than an entertaining but quirky, eccentric and credulous gossip. Only in the 1970s did the full breadth and innovation of his scholarship begin to be more widely appreciated. He published little in his lifetime, and many of his most important manuscripts (for the most part preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]]) remain unpublished, or published only in partial form.\n\n==Biography==\nAubrey was born at Easton Piers or Percy, near [[Kington St Michael]], Wiltshire, to a long-established and affluent gentry family with roots in the [[Welsh Marches]].<ref name=\"Fox 2008\">Fox 2008.</ref> His maternal grandfather, Isaac Lyte, lived at [[Lytes Cary Manor]], Somerset, now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Richard Aubrey, his father, owned lands in Wiltshire and Herefordshire. For many years an only child, he was educated at home with a private tutor, he was \"melancholy\" in his solitude. His father was not intellectual, preferring field sports (hunting) to learning. Aubrey read such books as came his way, including [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''[[Works by Francis Bacon#Essays|Essays]]'', and studied geometry in secret. He was educated at the Malmesbury [[grammar school]] under Robert Latimer. (Latimer had numbered the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] among his earlier pupils, and Aubrey first met Hobbes, whose biography he would later write, at Latimer's house.) He then studied at the grammar school at [[Blandford Forum]], Dorset.\n\nHe entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]], in 1642, but his studies were interrupted by the [[English Civil War]]. His earliest antiquarian work dates from this period in Oxford. In 1646 he became a student of the [[Middle Temple]]. He spent a pleasant time at Trinity in 1647, making friends among his Oxford contemporaries, and collecting books. He spent much of his time in the country, and in 1649 he first discovered the [[megalith]]ic remains at [[Avebury, Wiltshire|Avebury]], which he later mapped and discussed in his important antiquarian work ''Monumenta Britannica''. He was to show Avebury to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at the King's request in 1663. His father died in 1652, leaving Aubrey large estates, but with them some complicated debts.\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:ASC 11 db.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the southern inner ring at [[Avebury]]]]\nBlessed with charm, generosity of spirit and enthusiasm, Aubrey went on to become acquainted with many of the most celebrated writers, scientists, politicians and aristocrats of his day, as well as an extraordinary breadth of less well-placed individuals: booksellers, merchants, the royal seamstress, mathematicians and instrument makers. He claimed that his memory was \"not tenacious\" by 17th-century standards, but from the early 1640s he kept thorough (if haphazard) notes of observations in natural philosophy, his friends' ideas, and antiquities. He also began to write \"Lives\" of scientists in the 1650s. In 1659 he was recruited to contribute to a collaborative [[English county histories|county history]] of [[Wiltshire]], leading to his unfinished collections on the antiquities and the natural history of the county. His erstwhile friend and fellow-antiquary [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] predicted that he would one day break his neck while running downstairs in haste to interview some retreating guest or other. Aubrey was an apolitical [[Cavalier|Royalist]], who enjoyed the innovations characteristic of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] period while deploring the rupture in traditions and the destruction of ancient buildings brought about by civil war and religious change. He drank the King's health in Interregnum Herefordshire, but with equal enthusiasm attended meetings in London of the republican [[Rota Club]].\n\nIn 1663 Aubrey became a member of the [[Royal Society]]. He lost estate after estate due to lawsuits, till in 1670 he parted with his last piece of property and ancestral home, Easton Piers. From this time he was dependent on the hospitality of his numerous friends; in particular, [[Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet]] and his wife Lady Dorothy of Draycot House, Wiltshire. In 1667 he had made the acquaintance of Anthony Wood at Oxford, and when Wood began to gather materials for his ''Athenae Oxonienses'', Aubrey offered to collect information for him. From time to time he forwarded memoranda in a uniquely casual, epistolary style, and in 1680 he began to promise the work \"Minutes for Lives,\" which Wood was to use at his discretion.\n\nAubrey died of an [[apoplexy]] while travelling, in June 1697, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford|St Mary Magdalen, Oxford]].\n\n==Biographical methods==\nAubrey approached the work of the biographer much as his contemporary scientists had begun to approach the work of empirical research by the assembly of vast museums and small collection cabinets. Collating as much information as he could, he left the task of verification largely to Wood, and thereafter to posterity. As a hanger-on in great houses, he had little time and little inclination for systematic work, and he wrote the \"Lives\" in the early morning while his hosts were sleeping off the effects of the night before. These texts were, as Aubrey entitled them, ''Schediasmata'', \"pieces written extempore, on the spur of the moment\". Time after time, he leaves marks of omission in the form of dashes and ellipses for dates and facts, inserting fresh information whenever it is presented to him. The margins of his notebooks are dotted with notes-to-self, most frequently the Latin \"''[[quaere]]''\". This exhortation, to \"go and find out\" is often followed. In his life of [[Thomas Whitbread|Thomas Harcourt]], Aubrey notes that one Roydon, a brewer living in [[Southwark]], was reputed to be in possession of Harcourt's petrified kidney: \"I have seen it\", he writes approvingly; \"he much values it\".\n\nAubrey himself valued the evidence of his own eyes above all, and he took great pains to ensure that, where possible, he noted not only the final resting places of people, but also of their portraits and papers. Though his work has frequently been accused of inaccuracy, this charge is misguided. In most cases, Aubrey simply wrote what he had seen, or heard. When transcribing [[hearsay]], he displays a careful approach to the ascription of sources. For example, in his life of [[Thomas Chaloner (regicide)|Thomas Chaloner]] (who, Aubrey notes, was himself fond of spreading rumours in the concourse of [[Westminster Hall]], coming back after lunch to find them changed), he recorded an inaccurate and bawdy anecdote about Chaloner's death, but subsequently found it to be in fact about [[James Chaloner]]. Aubrey let the initial story stand in his text, while highlighting the error in a marginal note. A number of similar occurrences suggest that he was interested not only in the oral history he was noting down, but in the very processes of transmission and corruption by which it was formed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n==Works==\n\n===''Brief Lives''===\n{{main article|Brief Lives}}\nIn 1680, Aubrey began work on his collection of biographical sketches, which he entitled \"Schediasmata: Brief Lives\".  He presented them to Anthony Wood in 1681 but continued to work on them until 1693, when he deposited his manuscripts (in three folio volumes) in the [[Ashmolean Museum]]: they are now in the Bodleian Library, as MSS Aubrey 6\u20138.\n\nAs private, manuscript texts, the \"Lives\" were able to contain the richly controversial material which is their chief interest today, and Aubrey's chief contribution to the formation of modern biographical writing. When he allowed Anthony Wood to use the texts, however, he entered the caveat that much of the content of the Lives was \"not fitt to be let flie abroad\" while the subjects and the author were still living.\n\nAubrey's relationship with Wood was to become increasingly fraught. Aubrey asked Wood to be \"my index expurgatorius\": a reference to the Church's list of banned books, which Wood seems to have taken not as a warning, but as a licence to simply extract pages of notes to paste into his own proofs. In 1692, Aubrey complained bitterly that Wood had mutilated forty pages of his manuscript, perhaps for fear of a [[libel]] case. Wood was eventually prosecuted for insinuations against the judicial integrity of the school of Clarendon. One of the two statements called in question was founded on information provided by Aubrey and this may explain the estrangement between the two antiquaries and the ungrateful account that Wood gives of Aubrey's character. It is now famous: \"a shiftless person, roving and magotie-headed, and sometimes little better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with folliries and misinformations, which would sometimes guid him into the paths of errour\".<ref>The relationship between the two men is explored in Balme 2001.</ref>\n\nA large part of the \"Lives\" was published in 1813 as ''Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries''. A near-complete transcript, ''[[Brief Lives]], Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey, Between the Years 1669 and 1696'', was edited for the [[Clarendon Press]] in 1898 by the Rev. [[Andrew Clark (priest)|Andrew Clark]]. This remained the standard edition for scholarly use for many years, but (from a modern perspective) was flawed by the number of [[Expurgation|excisions]] Clark had made in the interests of \"decency\". In the 20th century, a number of more popular editions appeared, which often included the expurgated passages, but were in other respects far more selective: these included versions edited by [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]] (under the title ''The Scandal and Credulities of John Aubrey''; 1931), [[Anthony Powell]] (1949), Oliver Lawson Dick (1949), [[Richard Barber]] (1975), and John Buchanan-Brown (2000; with an introduction by [[Michael Hunter (historian)|Michael Hunter]]). The most scholarly and complete edition, and now the standard edition for reference purposes, is Kate Bennett (ed.), ''Brief Lives with An Apparatus for the Lives of our English Mathematical Writers'' (2 volumes, Oxford, 2015), which was described on publication by Michael Hunter as \"the edition we have been waiting for\".<ref name=\"Hunter 2015\">Hunter 2015</ref>\n\nThe \"Lives\" present a number of difficult editorial problems as to what should be included or excluded, and how best to present the material.<ref name=\"Hunter 2015\"/><ref>Bennett 2000.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=Editing Early Modern Texts: an introduction to principles and practice |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |pages=38\u20139 }}</ref> A controversial book for its time, \"Lives\" bluntly mocked the scandalous lives of eminent figures. For instance, Aubrey wrote of [[John Milton]]: \"\u201cHis complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ\u2019s College.\u201d He wrote of [[William Butler (physician)|William Butler]]: \"\u201cThe Dr. lying at the Savoy in London, next the water side where was a balcony look\u2019t into the Thames, a patient came to him that was grievously tormented with an ague. The Dr. orders a boat to be in readiness under his window, and discoursed with the patient (a gent) in the balcony, when on a signal given, 2 or 3 lusty fellows came behind the gent, and threw him a matter of 20 feet into the Thames. This surprise absolutely cured him.\u201d Of [[Ben Jonson]]: \u201cHe lies buried in the north aisle in the path of square stone\u2026 with this inscription only on him, in a pavement square of blue marble about 14\u201d square; O RARE BEN JONSON.\u201d Of [[William Shakespeare]]: \u201cHis comedies will remain wit as long as the English tongue is understood, for that he handles mores hominum [the ways of mankind]. Now our present writers reflect so much on particular persons and coxcombeities that twenty years hence they will not be understood.\u201d Aubrey also wrote of [[Francis Bacon]] that \"he was a Pederast.\"<ref>Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, s.v. \"Francis Bacon, Viscount of St. Albans\" p. 11.</ref>\n\nAt somewhat greater length, Aubrey also wrote a life of the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] (author of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''), entitled \"The Life of Mr Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury\": this is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 9. It is often grouped with the ''Brief Lives'', but is really a separate and self-contained work. It served as the basis for Richard Blackburne's Latin biography, ''Vitae Hobbianae auctarium'', published in 1681. The life of Hobbes was included in Clark's 1898 edition of ''Brief Lives'', but not in Bennett's 2015 edition.\n\n===''Monumenta Britannica''===\n[[Image:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|right|250px|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]\nThe ''Monumenta Britannica'' was Aubrey's principal collection of archaeological material, written over some thirty years between about 1663 and 1693. It falls into four parts: (1) \"Templa Druidum\", a discussion of supposed [[Druid|\"druidic\"]] temples, notably [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]]; (2) \"Chorographia Antiquaria\", a survey of other early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, \"camps\" ([[Hillforts in Britain|hillforts]]), and castles; (3) a review of other [[archeology|archaeological]] remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads, coins and urns; and (4) a series of more analytical pieces, including four exercises attempting to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>See Hunter 1975, pp. 156\u20137, 162\u20136, 181.</ref> Of these last, the essay on architecture, \"Chronologia Architectonica\", written in 1671, was the most detailed, and (although in its unpublished state it remained little known) is now regarded as a highly perceptive milestone in the development of architectural history.<ref>Colvin 1968.</ref><ref>Horsfall Turner 2011.</ref>\n\nThe manuscript of ''Monumenta Britannica'' is now Bodleian MSS Top.Gen.c.24 and 25. An edition of the first three parts (reproduced, following unorthodox editing principles, partly in [[facsimile]], and partly in printed transcript) was published by [[John Fowles]] and [[Rodney Legg]] in two volumes in 1980\u201382. This edition has, however, been criticised for doing Aubrey \"less than justice\" on various grounds: for a failure to consolidate what were essentially drafts and working notes into a coherent whole, for silent omissions and rearrangements, for inadequate and occasionally inaccurate annotation, and for the omission of the important fourth part of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=Laying the Foundations |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=28 November 1980 |page=1332 }} (\"less than justice\")</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Briggs |title=John Aubrey [letter] |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=30 January 1981 |page=113 }}</ref><ref>Burl 2010, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n===Wiltshire===\nAubrey began work on compiling material for a natural historical and antiquarian study of [[Wiltshire]] in 1656. Independently, in 1659, a self-appointed committee of Wiltshire gentry determined that a [[English county histories|county history]] should be produced on the model of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire''. It was agreed that Aubrey would deal with the northern division of the county.\n\nHe chose to divide the work into two separate projects, on the antiquities and the natural history of the county respectively. The work on the antiquities (which he entitled ''Hypomnemata Antiquaria'') was closely modelled on Dugdale, and was largely finished by 1671: Aubrey deposited his draft in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in two manuscript volumes. Unfortunately, one of these was withdrawn by his brother in 1703 and subsequently lost.<ref>For the contents of the lost volume, see Hunter 1975, pp. 241\u20132.</ref> He then turned to the county's natural history. Some of his interim observations were read to the [[Royal Society]] in 1668 and 1675\u20136. In 1685 Aubrey recast the work, now modelling it on [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (published in 1677); and it was effectively finished by 1690\u201391, when he transcribed a fair copy. Shortly afterwards the [[Royal Society]] commissioned another transcript, at a cost of \u00a37. In 1693 Aubrey asked his brother William Aubrey and [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]] to bring the project to completion, but despite their best intentions they failed to do so.\n\nThe manuscript of the ''Naturall Historie'' is now Bodleian MSS Aubrey 1 and 2. The Royal Society's copy, which includes material (mainly on supernatural phenomena) that Aubrey afterwards removed from his own manuscript, is now Royal Society MS 92. The surviving manuscript of the ''Antiquities'' is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 3. A highly selective edition of the ''Naturall Historie'' was published by [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] in 1847 for the Wiltshire Topographical Society. The ''Antiquities'' were published (again, with certain omissions) by [[John Edward Jackson (antiquarian)|John Edward Jackson]] in 1862 as ''Wiltshire: the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey''.\n\n====Editions====\n* {{cite book |title=Wiltshire: The Topographical Collections of John Aubrey, F.R.S., A.D. 1659\u201370, with Illustrations |editor-first=John Edward |editor-last=Jackson |editor-link=John Edward Jackson (antiquarian) |publisher=[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]] |location=Devizes |year=1862 |url=https://archive.org/details/wiltshiretopogra00aubr/page/n12 }}\n\n===''Perambulation of Surrey''===\nIn 1673, the royal cosmographer and cartographer [[John Ogilby]], planning a national atlas and [[chorography]] of Britain, licensed Aubrey to undertake a survey of [[Surrey]]. Aubrey carried out the work, but in the event Ogilby's project was curtailed, and he did not use the material. Aubrey, however, continued to add to his manuscript until 1692.\n\nThe manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 4. In a much-revised form (with both additions and excisions) it was published by [[Richard Rawlinson]] as the ''Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey'' in five volumes in 1718\u201319.\n\n===''Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme''===\nThe ''Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme'' was Aubrey's collection of material on customs, traditions, ceremonies, beliefs, old wives' tales and rhymes\u2014or what today would be termed [[folklore]]. It was compiled over many years, but written up between 1687 and 1689.\n\nThe manuscript came into the hands of [[White Kennett]], and as a result it is not with Aubrey's other collections in the Bodleian: it is in the [[British Library]], as [[Lansdowne manuscripts|Lansdowne MS]] 231. An edition was published by James Britten for the [[Folklore Society]] in 1881. It was more satisfactorily re-edited in 1972 by John Buchanan-Brown.<ref>Published in John Aubrey, ''Three Prose Works'', ed. John Buchanan-Brown (Fontwell, 1972), pp. 129\u2013304.</ref>\n\n===''Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum''===\nAubrey's ''Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum'' (its preface dated 31 October 1687) was the first attempt to devote a work entirely to the subject of English [[Toponymy|place-names]]. It is, however, unfinished (or, as Gillian Fellows-Jensen observes, \"hardly begun\").<ref>Fellows-Jensen 2000, p. 90.</ref> Aubrey compiled a list of some 5,000 place-names, but managed to provide derivations for only a relatively small proportion of them: many are correct, but some are wildly wrong. The manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 5.\n\n===''Miscellanies''===\nThe only work published by Aubrey in his lifetime was his ''Miscellanies'' (1696; reprinted with additions in 1721), a collection of 21 short chapters on the theme of \"hermetick philosophy\" (i.e. supernatural phenomena and the occult), including \"Omens\", \"Prophesies\", \"Transportation in the Air\", \"Converse with Angels and Spirits\", \"Second-Sighted Persons\", etc. Its contents mainly comprised documented reports of supernatural manifestations. The work did much to bolster Aubrey's posthumous reputation as a superstitious and credulous eccentric.\n\n===Other works===\nAubrey's papers also included \"Architectonica Sacra\"; and \"Erin Is God\" (notes on ecclesiastical antiquities).\n\nHis \"Adversaria Physica\" was a scientific commonplace book, which by 1692 amounted to a folio \"an inch thick\".<ref name=\"Fox 2008\"/> It is lost, although extracts have survived in the form of copies.\n\nHe wrote two plays, both comedies intended for [[Thomas Shadwell]]. The first has not survived; the second, \"Countrey Revell\", remained unfinished.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1967, English director [[Patrick Garland]] created a one-man show, \"Brief Lives\", based on Dick's edition of Aubrey's work. Starring [[Roy Dotrice]], it became the most successful one-man production ever seen, with Dotrice giving over 1800 performances across forty years on both sides of the Atlantic. For many, the play became an essential means of understanding a \"vanished time\" and one version of it. Aubrey scholars, however, have sometimes seen the production as over-emphasising its subject's eccentricities and lack of organisation, to the detriment of a wider appreciation of his contributions to scholarship.<ref>e.g. Bennett 2001, pp. 213\u20135</ref>\n\nIn the 1978 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial \"[[The Stones of Blood]]\"\u2014which features a neolithic stone circle\u2014the Doctor quips, \"I always thought that [[Druidism]] was founded by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John Aubrey.\"<ref>http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/16-3.htm</ref>\n\nIn 2008, ''Aubrey's Brief Lives''<ref>{{cite web|author=TV and Radio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3563885/Gillian-Reynolds-the-week-in-radio.html |title=Gillian Reynolds: the week in radio |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> was a five-part drama serial on Radio 4.

He is perhaps best known as the author of the ''[[Brief Lives]]'', his collection of short biographical pieces. He was a pioneer [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], who recorded (often for the first time) numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England, and who is particularly noted as the discoverer of the [[Avebury]] henge monument. The [[Aubrey holes]] at [[Stonehenge]] are named after him, although there is considerable doubt as to whether the holes that he observed are those that currently bear the name. He was also a pioneer [[Folkloristics|folklorist]], collecting together a [[miscellany]] of material on customs, traditions and beliefs under the title \"Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme\". He set out to compile [[English county histories|county histories]] of both [[Wiltshire]] and [[Surrey]], although both projects remained unfinished. His \"Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum\" (also unfinished) was the first attempt to compile a full-length study of English [[Toponymy|place-names]]. He had wider interests in applied mathematics and astronomy, and was friendly with many of the greatest scientists of the day.\n\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks largely to the popularity of ''Brief Lives'', Aubrey was regarded as little more than an entertaining but quirky, eccentric and credulous gossip. Only in the 1970s did the full breadth and innovation of his scholarship begin to be more widely appreciated. He published little in his lifetime, and many of his most important manuscripts (for the most part preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]]) remain unpublished, or published only in partial form.\n\n==Biography==\nAubrey was born at Easton Piers or Percy, near [[Kington St Michael]], Wiltshire, to a long-established and affluent gentry family with roots in the [[Welsh Marches]].<ref name=\"Fox 2008\">Fox 2008.</ref> His grandfather, Isaac Lyte, lived at [[Lytes Cary Manor]], Somerset, now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Richard Aubrey, his father, owned lands in Wiltshire and Herefordshire. For many years an only child, he was educated at home with a private tutor, he was \"melancholy\" in his solitude. His father was not intellectual, preferring field sports (hunting) to learning. Aubrey read such books as came his way, including [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''[[Works by Francis Bacon#Essays|Essays]]'', and studied geometry in secret. He was educated at the Malmesbury [[grammar school]] under Robert Latimer. (Latimer had numbered the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] among his earlier pupils, and Aubrey first met Hobbes, whose biography he would later write, at Latimer's house.) He then studied at the grammar school at [[Blandford Forum]], Dorset.\n\nHe entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]], in 1642, but his studies were interrupted by the [[English Civil War]]. His earliest antiquarian work dates from this period in Oxford. In 1646 he became a student of the [[Middle Temple]]. He spent a pleasant time at Trinity in 1647, making friends among his Oxford contemporaries, and collecting books. He spent much of his time in the country, and in 1649 he first discovered the [[megalith]]ic remains at [[Avebury, Wiltshire|Avebury]], which he later mapped and discussed in his important antiquarian work ''Monumenta Britannica''. He was to show Avebury to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at the King's request in 1663. His father died in 1652, leaving Aubrey large estates, but with them some complicated debts.\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:ASC 11 db.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the southern inner ring at [[Avebury]]]]\nBlessed with charm, generosity of spirit and enthusiasm, Aubrey went on to become acquainted with many of the most celebrated writers, scientists, politicians and aristocrats of his day, as well as an extraordinary breadth of less well-placed individuals: booksellers, merchants, the royal seamstress, mathematicians and instrument makers. He claimed that his memory was \"not tenacious\" by 17th-century standards, but from the early 1640s he kept thorough (if haphazard) notes of observations in natural philosophy, his friends' ideas, and antiquities. He also began to write \"Lives\" of scientists in the 1650s. In 1659 he was recruited to contribute to a collaborative [[English county histories|county history]] of [[Wiltshire]], leading to his unfinished collections on the antiquities and the natural history of the county. His erstwhile friend and fellow-antiquary [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] predicted that he would one day break his neck while running downstairs in haste to interview some retreating guest or other. Aubrey was an apolitical [[Cavalier|Royalist]], who enjoyed the innovations characteristic of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] period while deploring the rupture in traditions and the destruction of ancient buildings brought about by civil war and religious change. He drank the King's health in Interregnum Herefordshire, but with equal enthusiasm attended meetings in London of the republican [[Rota Club]].\n\nIn 1663 Aubrey became a member of the [[Royal Society]]. He lost estate after estate due to lawsuits, till in 1670 he parted with his last piece of property and ancestral home, Easton Piers. From this time he was dependent on the hospitality of his numerous friends; in particular, [[Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet]] and his wife Lady Dorothy of Draycot House, Wiltshire. In 1667 he had made the acquaintance of Anthony Wood at Oxford, and when Wood began to gather materials for his ''Athenae Oxonienses'', Aubrey offered to collect information for him. From time to time he forwarded memoranda in a uniquely casual, epistolary style, and in 1680 he began to promise the work \"Minutes for Lives,\" which Wood was to use at his discretion.\n\nAubrey died of an [[apoplexy]] while travelling, in June 1697, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford|St Mary Magdalen, Oxford]].\n\n==Biographical methods==\nAubrey approached the work of the biographer much as his contemporary scientists had begun to approach the work of empirical research by the assembly of vast museums and small collection cabinets. Collating as much information as he could, he left the task of verification largely to Wood, and thereafter to posterity. As a hanger-on in great houses, he had little time and little inclination for systematic work, and he wrote the \"Lives\" in the early morning while his hosts were sleeping off the effects of the night before. These texts were, as Aubrey entitled them, ''Schediasmata'', \"pieces written extempore, on the spur of the moment\". Time after time, he leaves marks of omission in the form of dashes and ellipses for dates and facts, inserting fresh information whenever it is presented to him. The margins of his notebooks are dotted with notes-to-self, most frequently the Latin \"''[[quaere]]''\". This exhortation, to \"go and find out\" is often followed. In his life of [[Thomas Whitbread|Thomas Harcourt]], Aubrey notes that one Roydon, a brewer living in [[Southwark]], was reputed to be in possession of Harcourt's petrified kidney: \"I have seen it\", he writes approvingly; \"he much values it\".\n\nAubrey himself valued the evidence of his own eyes above all, and he took great pains to ensure that, where possible, he noted not only the final resting places of people, but also of their portraits and papers. Though his work has frequently been accused of inaccuracy, this charge is misguided. In most cases, Aubrey simply wrote what he had seen, or heard. When transcribing [[hearsay]], he displays a careful approach to the ascription of sources. For example, in his life of [[Thomas Chaloner (regicide)|Thomas Chaloner]] (who, Aubrey notes, was himself fond of spreading rumours in the concourse of [[Westminster Hall]], coming back after lunch to find them changed), he recorded an inaccurate and bawdy anecdote about Chaloner's death, but subsequently found it to be in fact about [[James Chaloner]]. Aubrey let the initial story stand in his text, while highlighting the error in a marginal note. A number of similar occurrences suggest that he was interested not only in the oral history he was noting down, but in the very processes of transmission and corruption by which it was formed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n==Works==\n\n===''Brief Lives''===\n{{main article|Brief Lives}}\nIn 1680, Aubrey began work on his collection of biographical sketches, which he entitled \"Schediasmata: Brief Lives\".  He presented them to Anthony Wood in 1681 but continued to work on them until 1693, when he deposited his manuscripts (in three folio volumes) in the [[Ashmolean Museum]]: they are now in the Bodleian Library, as MSS Aubrey 6\u20138.\n\nAs private, manuscript texts, the \"Lives\" were able to contain the richly controversial material which is their chief interest today, and Aubrey's chief contribution to the formation of modern biographical writing. When he allowed Anthony Wood to use the texts, however, he entered the caveat that much of the content of the Lives was \"not fitt to be let flie abroad\" while the subjects and the author were still living.\n\nAubrey's relationship with Wood was to become increasingly fraught. Aubrey asked Wood to be \"my index expurgatorius\": a reference to the Church's list of banned books, which Wood seems to have taken not as a warning, but as a licence to simply extract pages of notes to paste into his own proofs. In 1692, Aubrey complained bitterly that Wood had mutilated forty pages of his manuscript, perhaps for fear of a [[libel]] case. Wood was eventually prosecuted for insinuations against the judicial integrity of the school of Clarendon. One of the two statements called in question was founded on information provided by Aubrey and this may explain the estrangement between the two antiquaries and the ungrateful account that Wood gives of Aubrey's character. It is now famous: \"a shiftless person, roving and magotie-headed, and sometimes little better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with folliries and misinformations, which would sometimes guid him into the paths of errour\".<ref>The relationship between the two men is explored in Balme 2001.</ref>\n\nA large part of the \"Lives\" was published in 1813 as ''Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries''. A near-complete transcript, ''[[Brief Lives]], Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey, Between the Years 1669 and 1696'', was edited for the [[Clarendon Press]] in 1898 by the Rev. [[Andrew Clark (priest)|Andrew Clark]]. This remained the standard edition for scholarly use for many years, but (from a modern perspective) was flawed by the number of [[Expurgation|excisions]] Clark had made in the interests of \"decency\". In the 20th century, a number of more popular editions appeared, which often included the expurgated passages, but were in other respects far more selective: these included versions edited by [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]] (under the title ''The Scandal and Credulities of John Aubrey''; 1931), [[Anthony Powell]] (1949), Oliver Lawson Dick (1949), [[Richard Barber]] (1975), and John Buchanan-Brown (2000; with an introduction by [[Michael Hunter (historian)|Michael Hunter]]). The most scholarly and complete edition, and now the standard edition for reference purposes, is Kate Bennett (ed.), ''Brief Lives with An Apparatus for the Lives of our English Mathematical Writers'' (2 volumes, Oxford, 2015), which was described on publication by Michael Hunter as \"the edition we have been waiting for\".<ref name=\"Hunter 2015\">Hunter 2015</ref>\n\nThe \"Lives\" present a number of difficult editorial problems as to what should be included or excluded, and how best to present the material.<ref name=\"Hunter 2015\"/><ref>Bennett 2000.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=Editing Early Modern Texts: an introduction to principles and practice |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |pages=38\u20139 }}</ref> A controversial book for its time, \"Lives\" bluntly mocked the scandalous lives of eminent figures. For instance, Aubrey wrote of [[John Milton]]: \"\u201cHis complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ\u2019s College.\u201d He wrote of [[William Butler (physician)|William Butler]]: \"\u201cThe Dr. lying at the Savoy in London, next the water side where was a balcony look\u2019t into the Thames, a patient came to him that was grievously tormented with an ague. The Dr. orders a boat to be in readiness under his window, and discoursed with the patient (a gent) in the balcony, when on a signal given, 2 or 3 lusty fellows came behind the gent, and threw him a matter of 20 feet into the Thames. This surprise absolutely cured him.\u201d Of [[Ben Jonson]]: \u201cHe lies buried in the north aisle in the path of square stone\u2026 with this inscription only on him, in a pavement square of blue marble about 14\u201d square; O RARE BEN JONSON.\u201d Of [[William Shakespeare]]: \u201cHis comedies will remain wit as long as the English tongue is understood, for that he handles mores hominum [the ways of mankind]. Now our present writers reflect so much on particular persons and coxcombeities that twenty years hence they will not be understood.\u201d Aubrey also wrote of [[Francis Bacon]] that \"he was a Pederast.\"<ref>Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, s.v. \"Francis Bacon, Viscount of St. Albans\" p. 11.</ref>\n\nAt somewhat greater length, Aubrey also wrote a life of the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] (author of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''), entitled \"The Life of Mr Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury\": this is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 9. It is often grouped with the ''Brief Lives'', but is really a separate and self-contained work. It served as the basis for Richard Blackburne's Latin biography, ''Vitae Hobbianae auctarium'', published in 1681. The life of Hobbes was included in Clark's 1898 edition of ''Brief Lives'', but not in Bennett's 2015 edition.\n\n===''Monumenta Britannica''===\n[[Image:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|right|250px|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]\nThe ''Monumenta Britannica'' was Aubrey's principal collection of archaeological material, written over some thirty years between about 1663 and 1693. It falls into four parts: (1) \"Templa Druidum\", a discussion of supposed [[Druid|\"druidic\"]] temples, notably [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]]; (2) \"Chorographia Antiquaria\", a survey of other early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, \"camps\" ([[Hillforts in Britain|hillforts]]), and castles; (3) a review of other [[archeology|archaeological]] remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads, coins and urns; and (4) a series of more analytical pieces, including four exercises attempting to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>See Hunter 1975, pp. 156\u20137, 162\u20136, 181.</ref> Of these last, the essay on architecture, \"Chronologia Architectonica\", written in 1671, was the most detailed, and (although in its unpublished state it remained little known) is now regarded as a highly perceptive milestone in the development of architectural history.<ref>Colvin 1968.</ref><ref>Horsfall Turner 2011.</ref>\n\nThe manuscript of ''Monumenta Britannica'' is now Bodleian MSS Top.Gen.c.24 and 25. An edition of the first three parts (reproduced, following unorthodox editing principles, partly in [[facsimile]], and partly in printed transcript) was published by [[John Fowles]] and [[Rodney Legg]] in two volumes in 1980\u201382. This edition has, however, been criticised for doing Aubrey \"less than justice\" on various grounds: for a failure to consolidate what were essentially drafts and working notes into a coherent whole, for silent omissions and rearrangements, for inadequate and occasionally inaccurate annotation, and for the omission of the important fourth part of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=Laying the Foundations |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=28 November 1980 |page=1332 }} (\"less than justice\")</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Briggs |title=John Aubrey [letter] |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=30 January 1981 |page=113 }}</ref><ref>Burl 2010, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n===Wiltshire===\nAubrey began work on compiling material for a natural historical and antiquarian study of [[Wiltshire]] in 1656. Independently, in 1659, a self-appointed committee of Wiltshire gentry determined that a [[English county histories|county history]] should be produced on the model of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire''. It was agreed that Aubrey would deal with the northern division of the county.\n\nHe chose to divide the work into two separate projects, on the antiquities and the natural history of the county respectively. The work on the antiquities (which he entitled ''Hypomnemata Antiquaria'') was closely modelled on Dugdale, and was largely finished by 1671: Aubrey deposited his draft in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in two manuscript volumes. Unfortunately, one of these was withdrawn by his brother in 1703 and subsequently lost.<ref>For the contents of the lost volume, see Hunter 1975, pp. 241\u20132.</ref> He then turned to the county's natural history. Some of his interim observations were read to the [[Royal Society]] in 1668 and 1675\u20136. In 1685 Aubrey recast the work, now modelling it on [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (published in 1677); and it was effectively finished by 1690\u201391, when he transcribed a fair copy. Shortly afterwards the [[Royal Society]] commissioned another transcript, at a cost of \u00a37. In 1693 Aubrey asked his brother William Aubrey and [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]] to bring the project to completion, but despite their best intentions they failed to do so.\n\nThe manuscript of the ''Naturall Historie'' is now Bodleian MSS Aubrey 1 and 2. The Royal Society's copy, which includes material (mainly on supernatural phenomena) that Aubrey afterwards removed from his own manuscript, is now Royal Society MS 92. The surviving manuscript of the ''Antiquities'' is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 3. A highly selective edition of the ''Naturall Historie'' was published by [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] in 1847 for the Wiltshire Topographical Society. The ''Antiquities'' were published (again, with certain omissions) by [[John Edward Jackson (antiquarian)|John Edward Jackson]] in 1862 as ''Wiltshire: the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey''.\n\n====Editions====\n* {{cite book |title=Wiltshire: The Topographical Collections of John Aubrey, F.R.S., A.D. 1659\u201370, with Illustrations |editor-first=John Edward |editor-last=Jackson |editor-link=John Edward Jackson (antiquarian) |publisher=[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]] |location=Devizes |year=1862 |url=https://archive.org/details/wiltshiretopogra00aubr/page/n12 }}\n\n===''Perambulation of Surrey''===\nIn 1673, the royal cosmographer and cartographer [[John Ogilby]], planning a national atlas and [[chorography]] of Britain, licensed Aubrey to undertake a survey of [[Surrey]]. Aubrey carried out the work, but in the event Ogilby's project was curtailed, and he did not use the material. Aubrey, however, continued to add to his manuscript until 1692.\n\nThe manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 4. In a much-revised form (with both additions and excisions) it was published by [[Richard Rawlinson]] as the ''Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey'' in five volumes in 1718\u201319.\n\n===''Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme''===\nThe ''Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme'' was Aubrey's collection of material on customs, traditions, ceremonies, beliefs, old wives' tales and rhymes\u2014or what today would be termed [[folklore]]. It was compiled over many years, but written up between 1687 and 1689.\n\nThe manuscript came into the hands of [[White Kennett]], and as a result it is not with Aubrey's other collections in the Bodleian: it is in the [[British Library]], as [[Lansdowne manuscripts|Lansdowne MS]] 231. An edition was published by James Britten for the [[Folklore Society]] in 1881. It was more satisfactorily re-edited in 1972 by John Buchanan-Brown.<ref>Published in John Aubrey, ''Three Prose Works'', ed. John Buchanan-Brown (Fontwell, 1972), pp. 129\u2013304.</ref>\n\n===''Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum''===\nAubrey's ''Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum'' (its preface dated 31 October 1687) was the first attempt to devote a work entirely to the subject of English [[Toponymy|place-names]]. It is, however, unfinished (or, as Gillian Fellows-Jensen observes, \"hardly begun\").<ref>Fellows-Jensen 2000, p. 90.</ref> Aubrey compiled a list of some 5,000 place-names, but managed to provide derivations for only a relatively small proportion of them: many are correct, but some are wildly wrong. The manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 5.\n\n===''Miscellanies''===\nThe only work published by Aubrey in his lifetime was his ''Miscellanies'' (1696; reprinted with additions in 1721), a collection of 21 short chapters on the theme of \"hermetick philosophy\" (i.e. supernatural phenomena and the occult), including \"Omens\", \"Prophesies\", \"Transportation in the Air\", \"Converse with Angels and Spirits\", \"Second-Sighted Persons\", etc. Its contents mainly comprised documented reports of supernatural manifestations. The work did much to bolster Aubrey's posthumous reputation as a superstitious and credulous eccentric.\n\n===Other works===\nAubrey's papers also included \"Architectonica Sacra\"; and \"Erin Is God\" (notes on ecclesiastical antiquities).\n\nHis \"Adversaria Physica\" was a scientific commonplace book, which by 1692 amounted to a folio \"an inch thick\".<ref name=\"Fox 2008\"/> It is lost, although extracts have survived in the form of copies.\n\nHe wrote two plays, both comedies intended for [[Thomas Shadwell]]. The first has not survived; the second, \"Countrey Revell\", remained unfinished.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1967, English director [[Patrick Garland]] created a one-man show, \"Brief Lives\", based on Dick's edition of Aubrey's work. Starring [[Roy Dotrice]], it became the most successful one-man production ever seen, with Dotrice giving over 1800 performances across forty years on both sides of the Atlantic. For many, the play became an essential means of understanding a \"vanished time\" and one version of it. Aubrey scholars, however, have sometimes seen the production as over-emphasising its subject's eccentricities and lack of organisation, to the detriment of a wider appreciation of his contributions to scholarship.<ref>e.g. Bennett 2001, pp. 213\u20135</ref>\n\nIn the 1978 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial \"[[The Stones of Blood]]\"\u2014which features a neolithic stone circle\u2014the Doctor quips, \"I always thought that [[Druidism]] was founded by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John Aubrey.\"<ref>http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/16-3.htm</ref>\n\nIn 2008, ''Aubrey's Brief Lives''<ref>{{cite web|author=TV and Radio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3563885/Gillian-Reynolds-the-week-in-radio.html |title=Gillian Reynolds: the week in radio |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> was a five-part drama serial on Radio 4. Writer [[Nick Warburton]] intertwined some of Aubrey's biographical sketches with the story of the turbulent friendship between Aubrey and Anthony Wood. Abigail le Fleming produced and directed.\n\nIn 2015, [[Ruth Scurr]] published ''John Aubrey: My Own Life'', a semi-fictional \"diary\" or \"autobiography\" of Aubrey, which draws heavily on Aubrey's own surviving scattered writings (with minor adaptation and modernisation), but is essentially an artificial construction by Scurr.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Lezard |authorlink=Nicholas Lezard |title=John Aubrey: My Own Life by Ruth Scurr review \u2013 a 'diary' to rival Pepys's |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/05/john-aubrey-my-own-life-by-ruth-scurr-review-diary-rival-pepys |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=9 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cockle bread]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book |first=Kate |last=Bennett |title=John Aubrey: Brief Lives with An Apparatus for the Lives of our English Mathematical Writers |place=Oxford |publisher=OUP |year=2015 }}\n* {{Cite journal |first=Kate |last=Bennett |title=John Aubrey's Oxfordshire Collections: an edition of Aubrey annotations to his presentation copy of Robert Plot's ''Natural History of Oxford-shire'', Bodleian Library Ashmole 1722 |journal=Oxoniensia |volume=64 |year=1999 |pages=59\u201386 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Kate |year=2000 |chapter=Editing Aubrey |editor1-first=Joe |editor1-last=Bray |editor2-first=Miriam |editor2-last=Handley |editor3-first=Anne C. |editor3-last=Henry |title=Ma(r)king the Text |place=Aldershot |publisher=Ashgate |pages=271\u201390 |ISBN=0754601684 }}\n* {{Cite journal |first=Kate |last=Bennett |title=John Aubrey's collections and the early modern museum|journal=Bodleian Library Record |volume=17 |year=2001 |pages=213\u201345 }}\n* {{Cite journal |first=Kate |last=Bennett |title=John Aubrey, Hint-Keeper: life-writing and the encouragement of natural philosophy in the pre-Newtonian seventeenth century |journal=Seventeenth Century |volume=22 |year=2007 |pages=358\u201380 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bennett |first=Kate |year=2009 |chapter=John Aubrey and the Lives of our English Mathematical Writers |editor1-first=Eleanor |editor1-last=Robson |editor2-first=Jacqueline |editor2-last=Stedall  |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics |place=Oxford |publisher=OUP |pages=329\u201352 }}\n* {{Cite book |editor-first=Maurice |editor-last=Balme |title=Two antiquaries: a selection from the correspondence of John Aubrey and Anthony Wood |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Durham Academic Press  |year=2001 |ISBN=1-900838-11-7 }}\n* {{cite book |first=John |last=Britton |title=Memoir of John Aubrey, F.R.S. |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |place=London |year=1845 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=Burl |title=John Aubrey & Stone Circles: Britain\u2019s first archaeologist, from Avebury to Stonehenge |place=Stroud |publisher=Amberley |year=2010 |ISBN=978-1-4456-0157-1}}\n* {{Cite book |editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Clark |editor-link=Andrew Clark (priest) |title=The Life and Times of Anthony Wood |place=Oxford |year=1891\u20131900 |volume=4 |pages=191\u2013193 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=John |last=Collier (ed.) |title=The Scandal and Credulities of John Aubrey |place=London |publisher=Peter Davies |year=1931 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Colvin |first=H.M. |authorlink=Howard Colvin |year=1968 |chapter=Aubrey's ''Chronologia Architectonica'' | editor-first=John |editor-last=Summerson |editor-link=John Summerson |title=Concerning Architecture: essays on architectural writers and writing presented to Nikolaus Pevsner |place=London |publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press |pages=1\u201312 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Dragstra |first=Henk |year=2008 |chapter='Before woomen were Readers': how John Aubrey wrote female oral history |editor1-first=M.E. |editor1-last=Lamb |editor2-first=Karen |editor2-last=Bamford |title=Oral traditions and gender in early modern literary texts |place=Aldershot |publisher=Ashgate |pages=41\u201356 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Gillian |last=Fellows-Jensen |title=John Aubrey, Pioneer Onomast?

Feature Animation]] and directed by [[Brad Bird]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. It is based on the 1968 novel ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'' by [[Ted Hughes]] (which was published in the United States as ''The Iron Giant'') and was scripted by [[Tim McCanlies]] from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of [[Vin Diesel]] (voicing the titular character), [[Eli Marienthal]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Christopher McDonald]] and [[John Mahoney]]. Set during the [[Cold War]] in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a gigantic metallic robot who fell from outer space. With the help of a [[beatnik]] artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a [[Musical film|musical]] with the involvement of [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]], though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using [[traditional animation]], with [[computer-generated imagery]] used to animate the titular character and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. [[Michael Kamen]] composed the film's score, which was performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic]].\n\n''The Iron Giant'' premiered at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999 and was released worldwide on August 6. Upon release, the film significantly under-performed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $48 million, which was due to Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' in the preceding year. Despite this, the film received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed at the story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine [[Annie Awards]] out of 15 nominations. Through [[home video]] releases and television syndication, the film gathered a [[cult following]] and is now widely regarded as a modern animated classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|title=Duncan Studios Adds New \u2018Iron Giant\u2019 Scenes for Remastered Re-release|quote=Brad Bird\u2019s 1999 '''animated classic''' ''The Iron Giant''...|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Terry|last= Flores}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|title='The Iron Giant,' a modern classic of animation returns: Indie & art house films|publisher=[[OregonLive.com]]|quote=Released in 1999, this '''modern classic''' of hand-drawn animation|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Jamie S. |last=Rich}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|quote=is now widely recognized as a '''modern classic'''|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006043238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|archive-date=2015-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2015, an extended, [[remaster]]ed version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nDuring the [[Cold War]], shortly after the [[Soviet Union]] launched ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, 11-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien [[robot]] attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the scene, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books chronicling the adventures of [[Superman]].\n\nThe incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the [[Korean War]]), and rents a room in their house to keep watch on him. Hogarth evades Kent and moves the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain \"death\" after witnessing hunters killing a deer.\n\nThat night, Hogarth is interrogated by Kent when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending the Giant is one of his art pieces. Angered by the apparent false alarm, Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Kent for his antics. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system and Dean orders it away for Hogarth's safety with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\n\nThe Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Kent jabbers wildly at Rogard to return to Rockwell when he spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell; the Army attacks the Giant after he had picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking Hogarth is dead and the military are responsible, transforms into a war machine in a fit of grief and retaliates, forcing its way back to Rockwell. Kent then convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove ineffective. Hogarth then wakes up and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down when Kent impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will destroy everyone upon impact. Kent attempts to escape, but the Giant stops him and Rogard has him arrested for his actions. In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words \"You are who you choose to be\", smiles contentedly and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population and the military forces nearby but seemingly at the cost of the Giant himself, leaving Hogarth devastated.\n\nMonths later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell and Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langj\u00f6kull]] glacier in [[Iceland]], and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n[[File:Iron Giant, LA Animation Festival, Christopher McDonald, Brad Bird, Eli Marienthol.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher McDonald]], [[Brad Bird]] and [[Eli Marienthal]] in March 2012 at the ''Iron Giant'' screening at the LA Animation Festival]]                                                                 \n\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Hogarth Hughes (named for illustrator Burne Hogarth), an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination.

McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. \"didn't have time to mess with us\" as McCanlies said.<ref name=ironlion>{{cite web|date=October 16, 2003 |last=Holleran |first=Scott |title=Iron Lion: An Interview with Tim McCanlies |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/features/?id=1257&p=.htm |access-date=January 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rvS5vgXf?url=http://boxofficemojo.com/features/?id=1257&p=.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as \"paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like ''The Yearling''.\"<ref name=\"birdint09\"/> Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, \"I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done.

He credited his time working on ''[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]'' as essential to team-building, and his tenure on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as an example of working under strict deadlines.<ref name=\"birdint09\"/> He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly.<ref name=\"lat99\"/> One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes\u2014something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if the audience has the remote and they're going to change channels,\" he commented at the time.<ref name=\"awm99\">{{cite news|title=Lean, Mean Fighting Machine: How Brad Bird Made ''The Iron Giant''|first=Bob|last=Miller|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|date=August 1999|issue=4.5|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.05/4.05pages/millerbird.php3|access-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323152658/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.05/4.05pages/millerbird.php3|archive-date=2016-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"[[Duck and Cover]]\" sequence came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.<ref name=\"dvdint\">{{cite video| people = Brad Bird, Jeffery Lynch | title =''The Iron Giant'' Special Edition.

Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"<ref name=\"awm99\"/> A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to [[Maine]], where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees,\" said production designer Mark Whiting.<ref name=\"aa99.3\"/>\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed [[animatics]], to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> The team initially worked with [[Macromedia]]'s [[Adobe Director|Director]] software, before switching to [[Adobe After Effects]] full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team\u2014dubbed \"Macro\" early on\u2014to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\"<ref name=\"awm98\">{{cite news|title=Director and After Effects: Storyboarding Innovations on The Iron Giant|author-link=Brad Bird|first=Brad|last=Bird|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|date=November 1998|issue=3.8|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8birdmacromedia.html|access-date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film.<ref name=\"aa99.1\"/> Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.<ref name=\"birdint09\"/>\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created.<ref name=\"lat99\"/><ref name=\"aa99.2\"/> The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using [[computer-generated imagery]] due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner.\"<ref name=\"productionotes\" /> They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.<ref name=\"lat99\"/> The Giant was designed by filmmaker [[Joe Johnston]], which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Bird brought in students from [[CalArts]] to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"<ref name=\"lat99\"/> Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including [[Alias Systems Corporation]]'s [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], Alias' [[PowerAnimator]], a modified version of [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]], [[Softimage 3D|Softimage Creative Environment]], [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Cambridge Animation's Animo]] (now part of [[Toon Boom Technologies]]), [[Avid Elastic Reality]], and [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name=\"aa99\">{{cite news|date=August 10, 1999|title=An Interview with...

This is exemplified by Dean's statement that \"You are who you choose to be\", which Hogarth later relays to the Giant. When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote ''The Iron Man'' as a means of comforting his children after his wife, [[Sylvia Plath]], committed suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite video\n| title = The Iron Giant: Signature Edition (The Giant's Dream)\n| medium = Blu-ray\n| publisher = Warner Bros.

Feature Animation]] and directed by [[Brad Bird]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. It is based on the 1968 novel ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'' by [[Ted Hughes]] (which was published in the United States as ''The Iron Giant'') and was scripted by [[Tim McCanlies]] from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of [[Vin Diesel]] (voicing the titular character), [[Eli Marienthal]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Christopher McDonald]] and [[John Mahoney]]. Set during the [[Cold War]] in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a gigantic metallic robot who fell from outer space. With the help of a [[beatnik]] artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a [[Musical film|musical]] with the involvement of [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]], though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using [[traditional animation]], with [[computer-generated imagery]] used to animate the titular character and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. [[Michael Kamen]] composed the film's score, which was performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic]].\n\n''The Iron Giant'' premiered at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999 and was released worldwide on August 6. Upon release, the film significantly under-performed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $48 million, which was due to Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' in the preceding year. Despite this, the film received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed at the story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine [[Annie Awards]] out of 15 nominations. Through [[home video]] releases and television syndication, the film gathered a [[cult following]] and is now widely regarded as a modern animated classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|title=Duncan Studios Adds New \u2018Iron Giant\u2019 Scenes for Remastered Re-release|quote=Brad Bird\u2019s 1999 '''animated classic''' ''The Iron Giant''...|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Terry|last= Flores}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|title='The Iron Giant,' a modern classic of animation returns: Indie & art house films|publisher=[[OregonLive.com]]|quote=Released in 1999, this '''modern classic''' of hand-drawn animation|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Jamie S. |last=Rich}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|quote=is now widely recognized as a '''modern classic'''|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006043238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|archive-date=2015-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2015, an extended, [[remaster]]ed version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nDuring the [[Cold War]], shortly after the [[Soviet Union]] launched ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, 11-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien robot attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the scene, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books chronicling the adventures of [[Superman]].\n\nThe incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the Korean War), and rents a room in their house to keep watch on him. Hogarth evades Kent and moves the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain \"death\" after witnessing hunters killing a deer.\n\nThat night, Hogarth is interrogated by Kent when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending the Giant is one of his art pieces. Angered by the apparent false alarm, Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Kent for his antics. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system and Dean orders it away for Hogarth's safety with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\n\nThe Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Kent jabbers wildly at Rogard to return to Rockwell when he spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell; the Army attacks the Giant after he had picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking Hogarth is dead and the military are responsible, transforms into a war machine in a fit of grief and retaliates, forcing its way back to Rockwell. Kent then convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove ineffective. Hogarth then wakes up and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down when Kent impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will destroy everyone upon impact. Kent attempts to escape, but the Giant stops him and Rogard has him arrested for his actions. In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words \"You are who you choose to be\", smiles contentedly and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population and the military forces nearby but seemingly at the cost of the Giant himself, leaving Hogarth devastated.\n\nMonths later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell and Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langj\u00f6kull]] glacier in [[Iceland]], and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n[[File:Iron Giant, LA Animation Festival, Christopher McDonald, Brad Bird, Eli Marienthol.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher McDonald]], [[Brad Bird]] and [[Eli Marienthal]] in March 2012 at the ''Iron Giant'' screening at the LA Animation Festival]]                                                                 \n\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Hogarth Hughes (named for illustrator Burne Hogarth), an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination.

Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"<ref name=\"awm99\"/> A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to [[Maine]], where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees,\" said production designer Mark Whiting.<ref name=\"aa99.3\"/>\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed [[animatics]], to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> The team initially worked with [[Macromedia]]'s [[Adobe Director|Director]] software, before switching to [[Adobe After Effects]] full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team\u2014dubbed \"Macro\" early on\u2014to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\"<ref name=\"awm98\">{{cite news|title=Director and After Effects: Storyboarding Innovations on The Iron Giant|author-link=Brad Bird|first=Brad|last=Bird|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|date=November 1998|issue=3.8|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8birdmacromedia.html|access-date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker.

It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.<ref name=\"birdint09\"/>\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created.<ref name=\"lat99\"/><ref name=\"aa99.2\"/> The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using [[computer-generated imagery]] due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner.\"<ref name=\"productionotes\" /> They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.<ref name=\"lat99\"/> The Giant was designed by filmmaker [[Joe Johnston]], which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Bird brought in students from [[CalArts]] to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"<ref name=\"lat99\"/> Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including [[Alias Systems Corporation]]'s [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], Alias' [[PowerAnimator]], a modified version of [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]], [[Softimage 3D|Softimage Creative Environment]], [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Cambridge Animation's Animo]] (now part of [[Toon Boom Technologies]]), [[Avid Elastic Reality]], and [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name=\"aa99\">{{cite news|date=August 10, 1999|title=An Interview with...

This is exemplified by Dean's statement that \"You are who you choose to be\", which Hogarth later relays to the Giant. When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote ''The Iron Man'' as a means of comforting his children after his wife, [[Sylvia Plath]], committed suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite video\n| title = The Iron Giant: Signature Edition (The Giant's Dream)\n| medium = Blu-ray\n| publisher = Warner Bros.

It had the [[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|ordnance inventory designation]] of '''Sd.Kfz. 171'''. It was designated as the '''''Panzerkampfwagen'' V ''Panther''''' until 27 February 1944, when [[Hitler]] ordered that the Roman numeral \"V\" be deleted. Contemporary English language reports sometimes refer to it as the '''\"Mark V\"'''.\n\nThe Panther was intended to counter the Soviet [[T-34]] and to replace the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier [[Tiger I]] until the end of the war. It is considered one of the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection, although its reliability was less impressive.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Stephen A.|title=Panther Medium Tank 1942-45|date=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|isbn=1841765430|pages=41\u201343}}</ref>\n\nThe Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I, it had more efficient frontal hull armour,<ref name=\"WWII Ballistics\">{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D|title=WWII Ballistics: Armor and Gunnery|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=13}}</ref> better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire. The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long range engagements, but did not provide enough [[high explosive]] firepower against infantry.{{sfn|Zaloga|2015|p=202}}\n\nThe Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive, were simplifications made to improve production rates and address raw material shortages. The overall design remained described by some as \"over-engineered\".{{sfn|Zaloga|2008|p=95-6}}{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}}{{sfn|Docherty|2013|p=124}} The Panther was rushed into combat at the [[Battle of Kursk]] despite numerous unresolved technical problems, leading to high losses due to mechanical failure. Most design flaws were rectified [[World War II#Allies gain momentum .281943.E2.80.9344.29|by late 1943 and early 1944]], though the bombing of  production plants, increasing shortages of high quality alloys for critical components, shortage of fuel and training space, and the declining quality of crews all impacted the tank's effectiveness.\n\nThough officially classified as a medium tank, its weight is more like that of a heavy tank, as its weight of 44.8 tons puts it roughly in the same category as the American [[M26 Pershing]] (41.7 tons), British [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] (40.7 tons) and the Soviet [[IS-2]] (46 tons) heavy tanks. The tank had a very high [[power-to-weight ratio]], making it highly mobile regardless of its tonnage. Its weight still caused [[Military Logistics|logistical]] problems, such as an inability to cross certain bridges.\n\nThe naming of Panther production variants did not, unlike most German tanks, follow alphabetical order: the initial variant, Panther \"D\" (''Ausf.&nbsp;D''), was followed by \"A\" and \"G\" variants.\n\n==Development and production==\n===Design===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14589, Albert Speer, Panzer T-34.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albert Speer]] examines a T-34 in June 1943]]\n\nThe Panther was born out of a project started in 1938 to replace the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks. The initial requirements of the [[VK 20]] series called for a fully tracked vehicle weighing 20 tonnes and design proposals by Krupp, Daimler Benz and MAN ensued. These designs were abandoned and Krupp dropped out of the competition entirely as the requirements increased to a vehicle weighing 30 tonnes, a direct reaction to the encounters with the Soviet [[T-34]] and [[KV-1 tank]]s and against the advice of [[Waffenamt|Wa Pruef 6]].<ref group=Notes>Wa Pruef 6 was the tank and motorized equipment department of the German arms procurement agency, the ''Waffenamt''.</ref><ref name=\"Schiffer Military History\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=16}}</ref> The T-34 outclassed the existing models of the Panzer III and IV.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 4\">{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=T-34/76 Medium Tank 1941-1945|date=1994|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1855323826|page=17}}</ref> At the insistence of General [[Heinz Guderian]], a special tank commission was created to assess the T-34.<ref>Doyle and Jentz 1997, p. 4</ref> Among the features of the Soviet tank considered most significant were the sloping armour, which gave much improved shot deflection and also increased the effective armour thickness against penetration, the wide track, which improved mobility over soft ground, and the {{convert|76.2|mm|abbr=on|0}} gun, which had good armour penetration and fired an effective high explosive round. [[Daimler-Benz]] (DB), which designed the successful Panzer III and [[StuG III]], and [[MAN SE|Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N\u00fcrnberg AG]] (MAN) were given the task of designing a new 30- to 35-tonne tank, designated VK 30.02, by April 1942.\n\nThe [[VK 3002(DB)|\"VK 30.02(DB)\"]] design resembled the T-34 in its [[Chassis|hull]] and [[gun turret|turret]] and was also to be powered by a diesel engine. It was driven from the rear drive sprocket with the turret situated forward. The incorporation of a diesel engine promised increased operational range, reduced flammability and allowed for more efficient use of petroleum reserves. Hitler himself considered a diesel engine imperative for the new tank.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 9\"/> DB's proposal used an external [[leaf spring]] suspension, in contrast to the MAN proposal of twin torsion bars. Wa Pruef 6's opinion was that the leaf spring suspension was a disadvantage and that using torsion bars would allow greater internal hull width. It also opposed the rear drive because of the potential for track fouling. Daimler Benz still preferred the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension as it resulted in a silhouette about {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} shorter and rendered complex shock absorbers unnecessary. The employment of a rear drive provided additional crew space and also allowed for a better slope on the front hull, which was considered important in preventing penetration by armour-piercing shells.<ref name=\"Schiffer Military History\"/>\n\nThe MAN design embodied a more conventional configuration, with the transmission and drive sprocket in the front and a centrally mounted turret. It had a [[petrol]] engine and eight torsion-bar suspension axles per side. Because of the torsion bar suspension and the drive shaft running under the turret basket, the MAN Panther was higher and had a wider hull than the DB design. The [[Henschel]] firm's design concepts for their [[Tiger I]] tank's suspension/drive components, using its characteristic ''Schachtellaufwerk'' format \u2013 large, overlapping, interleaved road wheels with a \"slack-track\" using no return rollers for the upper run of track, also features shared with almost all German military half-track designs since the late 1930s \u2013 were repeated with the MAN design for the Panther. These multiple large, rubber-rimmed steel wheels distributed ground pressure more evenly across the track. The MAN proposal also complemented Rheinmetall's already designed turret modified from that of the VK 45.01 (H),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=18}}</ref> and used a virtually identical Maybach V12 engine to the Tiger I heavy tank's Maybach HL230 powerplant model.\n\nThe two designs were reviewed from January to March 1942. ''Reichminister'' [[Fritz Todt|Todt]], and later, his replacement [[Albert Speer]], both recommended the DB design to Hitler because of its advantages over the initial MAN design. At the final submission, MAN refined its design, having learned from the DB proposal apparently through a leak by a former employee in the Wa Pruef 6, senior engineer Heinrich Ernst Kniepkamp and others.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 9\">{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=9}}</ref>  On 5 March 1942, [[Albert Speer]] reported that Hitler considered the Daimler-Benz design to be superior to MAN's design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=17}}</ref> A review by a special commission appointed by Hitler in May 1942 selected the MAN design. Hitler approved this decision after reviewing it overnight. One of the principal reasons given for this decision was that the MAN design used an existing turret designed by [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]], while the DB design would have required a brand new turret and engine to be designed and produced, delaying the commencement of production.<ref>Jentz 1995, p 16\u201318.</ref> This time-saving measure compromised the subsequent development of the design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=feIBwIK6DA0C&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22this+decision+was+a+disaster+for+the+Panther+tank+development+program+since+it+meant+that+getting+the+best+tank+possible+to+German+tankers+was+set+as&source=bl&ots=go9eCfntTx&sig=moljVGuL7aYSDQaq43nUZw8BbZU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QC5GVKW3Aqf2iQLImYCoAQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22this%20decision%20was%20a%20disaster%20for%20the%20Panther%20tank%20development%20program%20since%20it%20meant%20that%20getting%20the%20best%20tank%20possible%20to%20German%20tankers%20was%20set%20as&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAlbert Speer recounts in his autobiography ''Inside the Third Reich''\n{{quote|Since the Tiger had originally been designed to weigh fifty tons but as a result of Hitler's demands had gone up to fifty seven tons, we decided to develop a new thirty ton tank whose very name, Panther, was to signify greater agility. Though light in weight, its motor was to be the same as the Tiger's, which meant it could develop superior speed. But in the course of a year Hitler once again insisted on clapping so much armor on it, as well as larger guns, that it ultimately reached forty eight tons, the original weight of the Tiger.<ref>Speer 2009, p. 325</ref>}}\n\n===Production===\nA mild steel [[prototype]] of the MAN design was produced by September 1942 and, after testing at [[Kummersdorf]], was officially accepted. It was put into immediate production. The start of production was delayed, mainly because of a shortage of specialized machine tools needed for the machining of the hull. Finished tanks were produced in December and suffered from reliability problems as a result. The demand for this tank was so high that the manufacturing was soon expanded beyond MAN to include Daimler-Benz (Berlin-[[Marienfelde]], former [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|DMG]] plant), Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen [[Hanover]] (MNH, subsidiary of Eisenwerk W\u00fclfel/[[Hanomag]]) and the Tiger I's original designer, [[Henschel & Sohn]] in Kassel.\n\nThe initial production target was 250 tanks per month at the MAN plant at [[Nuremberg]]. This was increased to 600 per month in January 1943. Despite determined efforts, this figure was never reached due to disruption by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing, and manufacturing and resource bottlenecks. Production in 1943 averaged 148 per month. In 1944, it averaged 315 a month (3,777 having been built that year), peaking with 380 in July and ending around the end of March 1945, with at least 6,000 built in total. Front-line combat strength peaked on 1 September 1944 at 2,304 tanks, but that same month a record number of 692 tanks were reported lost.<ref name=\"Jentz284\">Jentz 1996, p. 284</ref>\n\nThe Allies directed bombing at the common chokepoint for both Panther and Tiger production: the Maybach engine plant. This was [[Bombing of Friedrichshafen in World War II|bombed the night of 27/28 April 1944]] and production halted for five months. A second factory had already been planned, the [[Auto Union]] [[Chemnitz|Siegmar]] plant (the former [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] car factory), and this came on line in May 1944.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 182</ref> The targeting of Panther factories began with a bombing raid on the DB plant on 6 August 1944, and again on the night of 23/24 August.

Hitler was briefed thoroughly on the comparison between the MAN and DB designs in the report by Guderian's tank commission. Armour protection appeared to be inadequate, while \"the motor mounted on the rear appeared to him correct\". He agreed that the \"decisive factor was the possibility of quickly getting the tank into production\". On 15 May 1942, Oberst Fichtner informed MAN that Hitler had decided in favour of the MAN Panther and ordered series production. The upper glacis plate was to be increased from {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}}. Hitler demanded that an increase to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} should be attempted and that at least all vertical surfaces were to be {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}; the turret front plate was increased from {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|page=18|isbn=0887408125}}</ref>\n\nThe Panther was rushed into combat before all of its teething problems had been corrected. Reliability was considerably improved over time, and the Panther proved to be a very effective fighting vehicle,<ref name=\"Armored Champion' p. 221\">Zaloga 2015, ''Armored Champion'' p. 221</ref> but some design flaws, such as its weak final drive units, were never corrected.\n\nThe crew had five members: driver, radio operator (who also fired the bow machine gun), gunner, loader, and commander.\n\n===Engine===\n\nThe first 250 Panthers were powered by a Maybach HL 210 P30 V-12 petrol engine, which delivered 650 [[metric horsepower|metric hp]] at 3,000 rpm and had three simple air filters.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 23. Some sources state that only a pre-production run of 20 Panthers used the HL 210 engine (Spielberger 1993 p. 27)</ref> Starting in May 1943, Panthers were built using the 700 metric horsepower (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm, 23.1&nbsp;litre [[Maybach]] [[Maybach HL230|HL 230 P30]] V-12 petrol engine.

D|publisher=Panzer Tracts |author=Thomas L. Jentz and Hilary Louis Doyle |year=2003 |pages=5\u201372}}</ref>\n\nThe HL 230 P30 engine was a very compact [[tunnel crankcase]] design, and it kept the space between the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls to a minimum. The [[crankshaft]] was composed of seven \"discs\" or main [[Bearing (mechanical)|journals]], each with an outer race of [[Rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]], and a crankshaft pin between each disc. To reduce the length of the engine by an inch or so, and reduce [[Engine balance|unbalanced rocking moment]] caused by a [[V engine|normal offset-Vee type engine]], the two banks of 6 cylinders of the V-12 were not offset \u2013 the \"big ends\" of the [[connecting rod]]s of each cylinder pair in the \"V\" where they mated with the [[crankpin]] were thus at the same spot with respect to the engine block's length rather than offset; this required a [[Fork and blade connecting rod|\"fork and blade]]\" matched pair of connecting rods for each transversely oriented pair of cylinders. Usually, \"V\"-form engines have their transversely paired cylinders' connecting rods' \"big ends\" simply placed side by side on the crankpin, with their transverse pairs of cylinders offset slightly to allow the connecting rod big ends to attach side by side while still being in the cylinder bore centerline. This compact arrangement with the connecting rods was the source of considerable problems initially.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Blown head gaskets were another problem, which was corrected with improved seals in September 1943. Improved bearings were introduced in November 1943. An engine governor was also added in November 1943 that reduced the maximum engine speed to 2,500&nbsp;rpm. An eighth crankshaft bearing was added beginning in January 1944 to reduce motor failures.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nThe engine compartment was designed to be watertight so that the Panther could ford water obstacles; however, this made the engine compartment poorly ventilated and prone to overheating. The fuel connectors in early Panthers were not insulated, leading to the leakage of fuel fumes into the engine compartment, which caused engine fires. Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gases, which only partly solved the problem of engine fires.<ref>Spielberger 1993, p. 52</ref> Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 62</ref> Despite the risks of fire, the fighting compartment was relatively safe due to a solid firewall that separated it from the engine compartment.<ref>Green, 2012 p.199</ref>\n\nEngine reliability improved over time. A French assessment in 1947 of their stock of captured Normandy Panther A tanks concluded that the engine had an average life of {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and maximum life of {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Spielberger 1993 p. 161\">Spielberger 1993, p. 161</ref>\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-296-1652-35, Nordfrankreich, Montage am Pantherlaufwerk.jpg|thumb|''Schachtellaufwerk'' interleaved wheels on a Panther]]\n\nThe suspension consisted of front drive sprockets, rear idlers and eight double-interleaved rubber-rimmed steel road wheels on each side \u2013 in the so-called ''Schachtellaufwerk'' design, suspended on a dual torsion bar suspension. The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor Ernst Lehr, allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel over undulating terrain. The extra space required for the bars running across the length of the bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank. When damaged by mines, the torsion bars often required a welding torch for removal.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 22, 61, 122, 156</ref>\n\nThe Panther's suspension was overengineered, and the ''Schachtellaufwerk'' interleaved road wheel system made replacing inner road wheels time-consuming (though it could operate with missing or broken wheels). The interleaved wheels also had a tendency to become clogged with mud, rocks and ice, and could freeze solid overnight in [[Operation Barbarossa#Phase four|the harsh winter weather]] that followed the autumn ''[[rasputitsa]]'' mud season on the Eastern Front. Shell damage could cause the road wheels to jam together and become difficult to separate.<ref>Spielberger 1993, p. 72</ref> Interleaved wheels had long been standard on all German [[half-track]]s. The extra wheels did provide better flotation and stability, and also provided more armour protection for the thin hull sides than smaller wheels or non-interleaved wheel systems, but the complexity meant that no other country ever adopted this design for their tanks.<ref>Green 2000, p. 80</ref> \n\nThe Inspector General of Armored Troops reported in May 1944:\n\n{{quote|Tracks and Suspension:\nAfter a mileage of between 1500 km and 1800km the tracks have great wear. In many cases the  guide horns  of the tracks bend outward or break. In 4 cases, the tracks had to be replaced when a whole series of reinforcement  guide horns were broken.\n\nReasons :\nThe guide horns are probably too weak because they bend easily.\n\nDue to the constant operations as well as the shortage of spare parts, the bearing system has not been able to be maintained and repaired as it should. For this reason, the bearing system in the available tanks is in very poor condition and has sometimes caused track/suspension failures.<ref>http://www.panzer-elmito.org/tanques/panther/documentos/I-PzRgt2_22-4-1944_002.jpg</ref>}}\n\n\nIn September 1944, and again in March/April 1945, [[M.A.N.]] built a limited number of Panthers with overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rimmed 80&nbsp;cm diameter roadwheels originally designed for Henschel's [[Tiger II]] and late series Tiger I Ausf. E tanks. These steel-rimmed roadwheels were introduced from chassis number 121052 due to raw material shortages.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 133</ref>\n\n\nFrom November 1944 through February 1945, a conversion process began to use [[sleeve bearing]]s in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of [[ball bearings]]. The sleeve bearings were primarily used in the running gear; plans were also made to convert the transmission to sleeve bearings, but were not carried out due to the ending of Panther production.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\n===Steering and transmission===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-280-1096-33, Russland, Reparatur eines Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|upright|Repair of the transmission of a Panther]]\n\nSteering was accomplished through a seven-speed AK 7-200 [[synchromesh]] gearbox, designed by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen]] (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} for 1st gear up to {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} for 7th gear. The driver was expected to judge the sharpness of a turn ahead of time and shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 23, 33\u201334</ref> This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks.\n\nThe AK 7-200 transmission was also capable of pivot turns, but tests showed this was possible only when the ground resistance on both tracks was the same.<ref>{{cite web |title=Panther Trials |url=https://tankarchives.blogspot.com/2014/04/panther-trials.html |website=Tank Archives |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> This high-torque method of turning could cause failures of the final drive.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 30</ref>\n\nThe overstressed transmission system resulted in the third gear being stripped prematurely in its service life.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven J. |title=Panther vs Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944 |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-84908-727-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edbvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq=Panther+tank+transmission+replace&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXobjKtP_lAhUMT6wKHXLrDV4QuwUwAnoECAYQBg#v=onepage&q=Panther%20tank%20transmission%20replace&f=false |accessdate=23 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  This problem was compounded by alloy shortages which made gears more brittle and prone to failure.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/> This led to the complicated task of accessing the transmission which was fully enclosed by the Panther's frontal armor.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/>  In order to access the final drive the entire driver's compartment and transmission had to be disassembled<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/> and lifted out.  This is sharply contrasted with accessing the Sherman transmission which only required the armor cover to be unbolted in the front.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/>\n\nThe Panther's main weakness was its final drive unit. The problems stemmed from several factors. The original MAN proposal had called for the Panther to have an [[epicyclic gearing]] (planetary) system in the final drive, similar to that used in the [[Tiger I]].<ref>Jentz 2000, pp. 13, 32, 35</ref> Germany suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting [[machine tools]] and, unlike the Tiger, the Panther was intended to be mass-produced. To achieve the goal of higher production rates, numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture. This process was aggressively pushed forward, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers, by the Chief Director of Armament and War Production, [[Karl-Otto Saur]] (who worked under, and later succeeded, ''Reichminister'' Speer). Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double spur system.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Although much simpler to produce, the double spur gears had inherently higher internal impact and stress loads, making them prone to failure under the high torque requirements of the heavy Panther tank.\n\n===Armour===\nInitial production Panthers had a [[Case hardening|face-hardened]] [[glacis]] plate (the main front hull armour piece), but as [[Shell (projectile)#Armor-piercing|armour-piercing capped rounds]] became the standard in all armies (thus defeating the benefits of face-hardening, which caused uncapped rounds to shatter), this requirement was deleted in March 1943. By August 1943, Panthers were being built only with a homogeneous steel glacis plate.<ref>Jentz 1995 p.29</ref> The front hull had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} of armour angled at 55 degrees from the vertical, welded but also interlocked with the side and bottom plates for strength. The combination of moderately thick and well-sloped armour meant that heavy Allied weapons, such as the Soviet [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]], [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|US 90 mm M3]]<ref>Armor-Piercing Ammunition for Gun, 90-mm, M3, Office of the Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D.C., 1945.</ref> were needed to assure penetration of the upper glacis at all combat ranges.<ref name=\"Jentz p. 127-129\">Jentz 1995, pp. 127\u2013129 Wa Pruef 1 penetration range tests 5 Oct 1944, and British Dept.

The thinner side armour was necessary to reduce the weight, but it made the Panther vulnerable to hits from the side by all Allied tank and anti-tank guns. German tactical doctrine for the use of the Panther emphasized the importance of flank protection.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 132</ref> {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[spaced armour]], known as ''Sch\u00fcrzen'', intended to provide protection for the lower side hull from Soviet anti-tank rifle fire, was fitted on the hull side.

The loss of molybdenum, and its replacement with other substitutes to maintain hardness, as well as a general loss of quality control, resulted in an increased brittleness in German armour plate, which developed a tendency to fracture when struck with a shell. Testing by U.S. Army officers in August 1944 in Isigny, France showed catastrophic cracking of the armour plate on two out of three Panthers examined.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' pp. 178, 182</ref><ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 13</ref>\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-478-2167-09, Italien, Panzer V (Panther), Panzersoldat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Main armament: 75 mm KwK 42 (L/70)]]\n\nThe main gun was a [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]] [[7.5 cm KwK 42|7.5 cm KwK 42 (L/70)]] with semi-automatic shell ejection and a supply of 79 rounds (82 on Ausf.

The main gun used three different types of ammunition: [[APCBC]]-HE (''Pzgr. 39/42''), [[HE-Frag|HE]] (''Sprgr. 42'') and [[Shell (projectile)#APCR|APCR]] (''Pzgr. 40/42''), the last of which was usually in short supply. While it was of a calibre common on Allied tanks, the Panther's gun was the most powerful of World War II, due to the large propellant charge and the long barrel, which gave it a very high [[muzzle velocity]] and excellent armour-piercing qualities \u2014 among Allied tank guns of similar caliber, none had equivalent muzzle energy. Only the British [[Sherman Firefly]] conversion's [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder]] gun, of 3 inch (76.2mm) calibre, and a 55 calibre long (L/55) barrel, with its availability to fire APDS shot had more potential armor perforation power but was considerably less accurate owing to disturbances caused by the separation of shot and sabot and at a cost of less severe damage inside the target after perforation of the armor. The flat [[trajectory]] and accuracy of the full bore ammunition also made hitting targets much easier, since accuracy was less sensitive to errors in range estimation and increased the chance of hitting a moving target. The Panther's 75&nbsp;mm gun had more penetrating power than the main gun of the [[Tiger I]] heavy tank, the [[8.8 cm KwK 36|8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56]],<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 127\u2013129; Jentz 1997 ''Germany's Tiger Tanks \u2013 Tiger I and Tiger II: Combat Tactics'' pp. 13\u201314; comparison of penetration range data between the Panther and Tiger I</ref> although the larger 88&nbsp;mm projectile might inflict more damage if it did penetrate.<ref>Zetterling 2000, p. 61</ref> The 75mm HE round was inferior to the 88mm HE round used for infantry support, but was on par with most other 75mm HE rounds used by other tanks and assault guns.<ref>The 'German Explosive Ordnance (Projectiles and Projectile Fuzes) - Department of the Army Technical Manual TM-9-1985-3' shows that the 8.8 cm KwK 36 HE shell from the Tiger I contained 0.9 kg of amatol (3765 Kilojoules).

An MG 34 machine gun was located co-axially with the main gun on the gun mantlet; an identical MG 34 was located on the glacis plate and fired by the radio operator. Initial Ausf. D and early Ausf.

If a non-penetrating hit bounced downwards off its lower section, it could penetrate the thin forward hull roof armour, and plunge down into the front hull compartment.<ref>Doyle and Jentz 1997, p. 9</ref> Penetrations of this nature could have catastrophic results, since the compartment housed the driver and radio operator sitting along both sides of the massive gearbox and steering unit. Also, four magazines containing main gun ammunition were located between the driver/radio operator seats and the turret, directly underneath the gun mantlet when the turret was facing forward.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 124</ref>\n\nFrom September 1944, a slightly redesigned mantlet with a flattened and much thicker lower \"chin\" design started to be fitted to Panther Ausf G models, the chin being intended to prevent such deflections. Conversion to the \"chin\" design was gradual, and Panthers continued to be produced to the end of the war with the rounded gun mantlet.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 96\">Jentz 1995, p. 96</ref>\n\nThe Ausf A model introduced a new cast armour commander's cupola, replacing the forged cupola. It featured a steel hoop to which a third MG 34 or either the coaxial or the bow machine gun could be mounted for use in the anti-aircraft role.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nThe first Panthers (Ausf D) had a hydraulic motor that could traverse the turret at a maximum rate of one complete revolution per minute, independent of engine speed. This was improved in the Ausf A model with a hydraulic traverse powered by the engine; one full turn took 46 seconds at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm but only 15 seconds if the engine was running at 3,000 rpm.<ref name=\"Jentz 57-60-126\">Jentz 1995, pp. 57, 60, 126</ref> This arrangement was a weakness, as traversing the Panther's turret rapidly onto a target required close coordination between the gunner and driver, who had to run the engine to maximum speed. By comparison, the M4 Sherman's electrically or electro-hydraulically traversed turret rotated at up to 360 degrees in 15 seconds and was independent of engine speed, which gave it an advantage over the Panther in close-quarters combat.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 28</ref> A hand traverse wheel was provided for the Panther gunner to make fine adjustment of his aim.<ref name=\"Jentz 57-60-126\"/>\n\n===Ammunition storage===\nAmmunition storage for the main gun was a weak point. All the ammunition for the main armament was stored in the hull, with a significant amount stored in the sponsons. In the Ausf D and A models, 18 rounds were stored next to the turret on each side, for a total of 36 rounds. In the Ausf G, which had deeper sponsons, 24 rounds were stored on each side of the turret, for a total of 48 rounds. In all models, four rounds were also stored in the left sponson between the driver and the turret. An additional 36 rounds were stored inside the hull of the Ausf D and A models \u2013 27 in the forward hull compartment directly underneath the mantlet. In the Ausf G, the hull ammunition storage was reduced to 27 rounds total, with 18 rounds in the forward hull compartment. For all models, three rounds were kept under the turntable of the turret.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 88, 124</ref> The stowage of 52 rounds of ammunition in the side sponsons made this area the most vulnerable point on the Panther since penetration here usually led to [[Catastrophic kill|catastrophic ammunition fires]].<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs. Sherman'' p. 22</ref>\n\nThe loader was stationed in the right side of the turret. With the turret facing forward, he had access only to the right sponson and hull ammunition,<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 34</ref> and so these served as the main ready-ammunition bins.\n\n===Crew===\nThe Panther had 5 crew members, the commander, gunner, loader, driver and radio operator. The commander, loader and gunner were in the turret, While the driver and radio operator were in the hull of the vehicle. The driver sat always on the front-left side of the tank and next to him was the tank's machine gunner whose job it was to operate the radio.\n\n==Combat use==\nPanthers were supplied to form ''Panzer Abteilung'' 51 (Tank Battalion 51) on 9 January, and then ''Panzer Abteilung'' 52 on 6 February 1943.<ref>Jentz 1996, pp. 55, 58.</ref>\n\nThe first production Panther tanks were plagued with mechanical problems. The engine was dangerously prone to overheating and suffered from connecting rod or bearing failures. Petrol leaks from the fuel pump or [[carburettor]], as well as motor oil leaks from gaskets, produced fires in the engine compartment; which resulted in the total writeoff of three Panthers due to fires.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|page=133|isbn=0887408125}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=33}}</ref> Transmission and final drive breakdowns were the most common and difficult to repair. A large list of other problems were detected in these early Panthers, and so from April through May 1943 all Panthers were shipped to Falkensee and N\u00fcrnberg for a major rebuilding program. This did not correct all of the problems, so a second program was started at Grafenwoehr and Erlangen in June 1943. Reliability improved with the Ausf. A and later G of the Panther, with availability rates going from an average of 37% by end of 1943<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 95</ref> to an average of 54% in 1944.<ref>Zaloga 2015, ''Armored Champion'' p. 221, 223</ref> By mid-1944, the Panther was at its peak performance and widely regarded as the most formidable tank on the battlefield.<ref name=\"Armored Champion' p. 221\"/>\n\n===Eastern Front===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-244-2321-34, Ostfront-S\u00fcd, Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|Panther on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], 1944.]]\n<!---[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J24359, Rum\u00e4nien, Kolonne von Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|right|Panther tanks of the [[Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division]] advance in the area of [[Ia\u015fi]], [[Romania]] in 1944.]]--->\n\nThe Panther tank was seen as a necessary component of [[Battle of Kursk|Operation Citadel]], and the attack was delayed several times because of their mechanical problems and to receive more Panthers, with the eventual start date of the battle only six days after the last Panthers had been delivered to the front. This resulted in major problems in Panther units during the [[Battle of Kursk]], as tactical training at the unit level, coordination by radio, and driver training were all seriously deficient.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\">Jentz 1995, p. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\nIt was not until 23\u201329 June 1943 that a total of 200 rebuilt Panthers were finally issued to Panther Regiment von Lauchert, of the XLVIII Panzer Corps (4 Panzer Army). Two were immediately lost due to motor fires on disembarking from the trains.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\"/> By 5 July, when the Battle of Kursk started, there were only 184 operational Panthers. Within two days, this had dropped to 40.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\"/> On 17 July 1943, after [[Hitler]] had ordered a stop to the German offensive, Gen. [[Heinz Guderian]] sent in the following preliminary assessment of the Panthers:\n\n{{quote|Due to enemy action and mechanical breakdowns, the combat strength sank rapidly during the first few days. By the evening of 10 July there were only 10 operational Panthers in the front line. 25 Panthers had been lost as total writeoffs (23 were hit and burnt and two had caught fire during the approach march). 100 Panthers were in need of repair (56 were damaged by hits and mines and 44 by mechanical breakdown). 60 percent of the mechanical breakdowns could be easily repaired. Approximately 40 Panthers had already been repaired and were on the way to the front. About 25 still had not been recovered by the repair service ... On the evening of 11 July, 38 Panthers were operational, 31 were total write-offs and 131 were in need of repair. A slow increase in the combat strength is observable. The large number of losses by hits (81 Panthers up to 10 July) attests to the heavy fighting.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\"/>}}During Zitadelle the Panthers claimed 267 destroyed tanks.<ref>Frieser, P. 159. Frieser cites Zetterling/Frankson: Kursk.</ref>\n\nA later report on 20 July 1943 showed 41 Panthers as operational, 85 as repairable, 16 severely damaged and needing repair in Germany, 56 burnt out because of enemy action, and two destroyed by motor fires.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995 p. 134\">Jentz 1995, p. 134</ref>\n\nBefore the Germans ended their offensive at Kursk, the Soviets began their counteroffensive, and succeeded in pushing the Germans back into a steady retreat. Thus, a report on 11 August 1943 showed that the number of total write-offs in Panthers swelled to 156, with only 9 operational. The German Army was forced into a fighting retreat, and increasingly lost Panthers in combat as well as from abandoning and destroying damaged vehicles.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995 p. 134\"/>\n\nThe Panther demonstrated its capacity to destroy any Soviet armoured fighting vehicle from long distance during the Battle of Kursk, and had a very high overall kill ratio.<ref>Healy 2008, p. 170</ref> It constituted less than seven percent of the estimated 2,400\u20132,700 total armoured fighting vehicles deployed by the Germans in this battle,<ref>Healy 2008, pp. 161\u2013165</ref> and its effectiveness was limited by its mechanical problems and the in-depth layered defence system of the Soviets at Kursk. Its greatest historical role in the battle may have been a highly negative one\u2014its contribution to the decisions to delay the original start of [[Operation Zitadelle]] for a total of two months, time which the Soviets used to build up an enormous concentration of minefields, anti-tank guns, trenches and artillery defences.<ref>Healy 2008, pp. 64\u201372</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-124-12A, Russland, Infanterie und Panzer im Kampf.jpg|thumb|left|An early Panther Ausf. D supporting infantry on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front.]]]]\n\nAfter the losses of the Battle of Kursk, the German Army went into a permanent state of retreat from the Red Army. The numbers of Panthers were slowly built up again on the Eastern Front, and the operational percentage increased as reliability improved. In March 1944 Guderian reported: \"Almost all the bugs have been worked out\", although many units continued to report significant mechanical problems, especially with the final drive.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 139\u2013142</ref> The greatly outnumbered Panthers came to be used as mobile reserves to fight off major attacks.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 142\u2013144</ref>\n\nThe highest total number of operational Panthers on the Eastern Front was achieved in September 1944, when some 522 were listed as operational out of a total of 728. Throughout the rest of the war Germany continued to keep the great majority of Panther forces on the Eastern Front, where the situation progressively worsened for them. The last recorded status, on 15 March 1945, listed 740 on the Eastern Front, of which 361 were operational.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 143</ref> By this time the Red Army had entered East Prussia and was advancing through Poland.\n\nIn August 1944 Panthers were deployed during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] as mobile artillery and troop support.

From June through August 1944, an additional seven Panther regiments were sent into France, reaching a maximum strength of 432 in a status report dated 30 July 1944.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 147\u2013152</ref>\n\nThe majority of the German tank forces in Normandy \u2013 six and a half divisions \u2013 were drawn into fighting the Anglo-Canadian forces of the [[21st Army Group]] around the town of Caen. The numerous operations undertaken to secure the town became collectively known as the [[Battle of Caen]]. While there were areas of heavy wooded [[bocage]] around Caen, most of the terrain was open fields which allowed the Panther to engage the attacking enemy armour at long range \u2014 its combination of superior armour and firepower allowed it to engage at distances from which the Shermans could not respond.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 193</ref> Conversely, by the time of the Normandy Campaign, British divisional Anti-tank Regiments were well equipped with the excellent 17-pounder gun, and some US-supplied M10 tank destroyers had their 3-inch gun replaced with the 17pdr (giving the [[17pdr SP Achilles]]), making it equally as perilous for Panthers to attack across these same fields. The British had begun converting regular [[M4 Shermans]] to carry the 17-pounder gun (nicknamed [[Sherman Firefly|Firefly]]) prior to the D-Day landings. While limited numbers meant that during Normandy usually not more than one Sherman in each troop of four tanks was a Firefly variant, the lethality of the gun against German armour made them priority targets for German gunners.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. forces, facing one and a half German ''panzer'' divisions, mainly the ''Panzer Lehr'' Division, struggled in the heavy, low-lying bocage terrain west of Caen. Like the Sherman. the Panther struggled in the bocage country of Normandy, and was vulnerable to side and close-in attacks in the built-up areas of cities and small towns.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' pp. 177\u2013179</ref> The commander of the ''Panzer Lehr'' Division, Gen.

Zaloga argues that this was down to the fact that at this point in the war, the quality of German tank crews had fallen and most Panther crews were inexperienced with minimal training. The lack of training exacerbated the Panther's technical weaknesses (poor power train durability and a lack of fuel and spare parts), resulting in many Panthers breaking down which were unable to be salvaged. Thus while a Panther was superior to a Sherman in the hands of an experienced crew, inadequate training, coupled with Sherman numerical superiority, resulted in a poor combat performance for the vehicle during the offensive.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 5</ref>\n\n===Fortification===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-587-2267-24, Italien, befestigte Stellung, Inspektion.jpg|thumb|''Pantherturm'' fortification in Italy, mid 1944.]]\n\nFrom 1943, Panther turrets were mounted in fixed fortifications; some were normal production models, but most were made specifically for the task, with additional roof armour to withstand artillery fire.

After taking two years to catch up with German tank design in Africa, the British were wary of falling behind yet again. They had developed the excellent [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder anti-tank gun]], but did not yet have a vehicle in service that could fit this large gun into its turret. For its part, the U.S. Army did not believe that the Panther would be a significant problem, and did not foresee their armoured forces having to fight pitched engagements against large numbers of Panthers. The Panther was not seen in combat by the Western Allies until [[Operation Shingle|early 1944 at Anzio]] in Italy, where Panthers were employed in small numbers. Until just before [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Panther was thought to be another heavy tank that would not be built in large numbers.\n\nShortly before D-Day, Allied intelligence reported that large numbers of Panthers were being used in the panzer divisions, and an attempt was made to investigate Panther production. Using [[German tank problem|a statistical analysis of the serial numbers on the road wheels]] on two captured tanks, U.S. intelligence estimated Panther production for February 1944 to be 270 units, much greater than what had been anticipated. This estimate was very accurate, especially compared to previous methods, as German records after the war showed production of Panthers for the month of February 1944 was 276. This indicated that the Panther would be encountered in much larger numbers than had previously been thought.<ref>Ruggles and Brodie, pp. 82\u201383</ref> In the planning for the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], the U.S. Army expected to face a handful of German heavy tanks alongside large numbers of Panzer IVs. At this point, it was too late to prepare to face the Panther. As it turned out, 38% of the German tanks in Normandy were Panthers, whose frontal armour could not be penetrated by the 75&nbsp;mm guns of the US [[M4 Sherman]].\n\n[[File:Sherman Firefly 9-08-2008 15-05-43.JPG|left|thumb|A preserved Sherman Firefly Mk Ic (2008); its gun barrel is painted with the [[countershading]] pattern used to disguise its length]]\nThe British were more astute in their recognition of the danger posed by the increasing armour strength of German tanks. Work on a more powerful anti-tank gun had started in 1941, and the tanks to use it in 1942. When these programmes were delayed, a stop-gap solution was found. The 17-pdr could through modifications be fitted to a Sherman, and orders for this [[Sherman Firefly]] were placed in 1943. By the time of the Normandy invasion, 340 Sherman Fireflies were available to the Commonwealth armoured divisions. The British lobbied for American production lines to be modified to produce Fireflies, but these suggestions were declined by the U.S. Army, in part due to the poor performance of British tank designs in North Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Maj. Gen I. D. White. Exhibit No. 1: \"Comparison of US equipment with Similar German Equipment\". Report for Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force. 20 March 1945</ref> There were also 200 interim [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger tanks]] with the 17-pounder and other improved tank designs were under development. British and Commonwealth tank units in Normandy were initially equipped at the rate of one Firefly in a troop with three Shermans or [[Cromwell tank|Cromwells]]. This ratio increased until, by the end of the war, half of the British Shermans were Fireflies. The [[Comet tank|Comet]] with a gun similar to the 17-pounder had also replaced the 75&nbsp;mm gun Sherman in some British units. The 17-pounder with [[APCBC]] shot was more or less equivalent in performance to the Panther's 75&nbsp;mm gun, but superior with [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] shot.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs. Sherman'' p. 28</ref>\n\nAt the time, U.S. armour doctrine was dominated by the head of Army Ground Forces, Gen. [[Lesley McNair]]. An artilleryman by trade, he believed that tanks should concentrate on infantry support and exploitation roles and avoid enemy tanks, leaving them to be dealt with by the [[tank destroyer]] force, which was a mix of towed anti-tank guns and lightly armoured fighting vehicles with open top turrets with 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) ([[M10 tank destroyer]]), 76&nbsp;mm ([[M18 Hellcat]]) or later, 90&nbsp;mm ([[M36 tank destroyer]]) guns. This doctrine led to a lack of urgency in the U.S. Army to upgrade the armour and firepower of the M4 Sherman tank, which had previously done well against the most common German tanks \u2013 Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs \u2013 in Africa and Italy. As with the Soviets, the German adoption of thicker armour and the [[7.5 cm KwK 40]] in their standard armoured fighting vehicles prompted the U.S. Army to develop the more powerful 76&nbsp;mm version of the M4 Sherman tank in April 1944. Development of a heavier tank, the [[M26 Pershing]], was delayed mainly by McNair's insistence on \"battle need\" and emphasis on producing only reliable, well-tested weapons, a reflection of America's {{convert|3000|mi|km|abbr=on}} supply line to Europe.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' pp. 43\u201348, 72\u201377, 115\u2013116, 120\u2013125</ref>\n\nAn AGF (Armored Ground Forces) policy statement of November 1943 concluded the following:\n\n{{quote|The recommendation of a limited proportion of tanks carrying a 90mm gun is not concurred in for the following reasons: The M4 tank has been hailed widely as the best tank of the battlefield today.&nbsp;... There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank. There can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank-vs.-tank duel-which is believed to be unsound and unnecessary. Both British and American battle experience has demonstrated that the antitank gun in suitable numbers is the master of the tank.&nbsp;... There has been no indication that the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against German Mark VI tank.<ref>AGF policy statement. Chief of staff AGF. November 1943. MHI</ref>}}\n\nU.S. awareness of the inadequacies of their tanks grew only slowly. All U.S. M4 Shermans that landed in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75&nbsp;mm gun. The general purpose 75&nbsp;mm M4 gun could not penetrate the Panther from the front at all, although it could penetrate various parts of the Panther from the side at ranges from {{convert|400|to|2600|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The 76&nbsp;mm gun could also not penetrate the front hull armour of the Panther, but could penetrate the Panther turret mantlet at very close range.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 127</ref> In August 1944, the [[HVAP]] (high velocity armour-piercing) 76&nbsp;mm round was introduced to improve the performance of the 76&nbsp;mm M4 Shermans. With a tungsten core, this round could still not penetrate the Panther glacis plate, but could punch through the Panther mantlet at {{convert|730|to|910|m|yard|abbr=on}}, instead of the usual {{convert|91|m|yard|abbr=on}} for the normal 76&nbsp;mm round. Tungsten production shortages meant that this round was always in short supply, with only a few available per tank, and some M4 Sherman units never received any.<ref>Zaloga 2008 ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nWhereas Sherman tanks used a high flash powder, making it easier for German tankers to spot them, German tanks used a low flash powder, making it harder for Allied crews to spot them.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Shermans, even though they were around 15 tons lighter than Panthers, had worse cross country mobility due to their narrower tracks. A US corporal stated:\n\n{{quote|I saw where some MkV tanks crossed a muddy field without sinking the tracks over five inches, where we in the M4 started across the same field the same day and bogged down.<ref>Brig.

It was very effective against the Panther's front turret and side.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 218</ref>\n\nThe high U.S. tank losses in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] against a force largely of Panther tanks brought about a clamour for better armour and firepower. At General Eisenhower's request, only 76&nbsp;mm gun-armed M4 Shermans were shipped to Europe for the remainder of the war. Small numbers of the M26 Pershing were also rushed into combat in late February 1945.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbot'' pp. 268\u2013269, 287\u2013290</ref> A dramatic newsreel film was recorded by a U.S. Signal Corps cameraman of an M26 stalking and then blowing up a Panther in the city of Cologne, after the Panther had knocked out two M4 Shermans.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 289</ref>\n\nThe production of Panther tanks and other German tanks dropped off sharply after January 1945, and eight of the Panther regiments still on the Western Front were transferred to the Eastern Front in February 1945. The result was that, for the rest of the war during 1945, the greatest threats to the tanks of the Western Allies were no longer German tanks, but infantry anti-tank weapons, such as the [[Panzerschreck]] and [[Panzerfaust]], infantry anti-tank guns, such as the ubiquitous [[7.5 cm Pak 40]], and tank destroyers, such as the [[Marder III|Marder]], StuG III, [[StuG IV]], and [[Jagdpanzer]]. A German Army status report dated 15 March 1945 showed 117 Panthers left in the entire Western Front, of which only 49 were operational.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 153</ref>\n\n==Further development==\n<!-- Note: The above heading is used in [[Template:WWIIGermanAFVs]] to point to Panther II.

The turret on display was not originally fitted to this hull and was installed later.]]\n{{Main|Panther II tank}}\n\nThe early impetus for upgrading the Panther came from the concern of Hitler and others that it lacked sufficient armour. Hitler had already insisted on an increase in its armour once, early in its design process in 1942. Discussions involving Hitler in January 1943 called for further increased armour; initially referred to as Panther 2 (it became the Panther II after April 1943). This upgrade increased the thickness of the glacis plate to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}, the side armour to {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}}, and the top armour to {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}}. Production of the Panther 2 was slated to begin in September 1943.\n\nOn 10 February 1943, Dr. Wiebecke (chief design engineer for M.A.N.) suggested thoroughly redesigning the Panther II and incorporating Tiger components such as the steering gears, final drive, entire suspension and turret based on Eastern Front experience. Total weight would increase to more than 50 metric tons.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Germany's Panther Tank. The Quest for Combat Supremacy|last = Jentz|first = Thomas L.|publisher = Schiffer Publishing Ltd.|year = 1995|isbn = 0-88740-812-5|location = Atglen, PA|pages = 51}}</ref> Another meeting on 17 February 1943 focused on sharing and standardizing parts between the [[Tiger II]] tank and the Panther II, such as the transmission, all-steel eighty centimeter diameter roadwheels (only overlapping and not interleaved as the original ''Schachtellaufwerk'' roadwheel design used) and running gear. Additional meetings in February began to outline the various components, including a suggestion to adopt the King Tiger's hard-hitting 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 43 L/71 gun, but it was ultimately decided to continue use of the production Panther's 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70 gun.<ref>Thomas L. Jentz \"Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy, Development Modifications, Rare Variants, Characteristics, Combat Accounts\"</ref> In March 1943, MAN indicated that the first prototype would be completed by August 1943. A number of engines were under consideration, among them the new Maybach HL 234 fuel-injected engine (900&nbsp;hp operated by an 8-speed hydraulic transmission) and the [[BMW 003]] aviation turbojet-derived, [[GT 101]] [[turboshaft]] powerplant, planned to be of some 1,150 shaft horsepower output and weighing only some 450&nbsp;kg (992&nbsp;lb) without its transmission, only some 38% of the weight of the Panther's standard [[Maybach HL230]] V-12 gasoline fueled piston engine.\n\nThus, plans to replace the original Panther design with the [[Panther II tank|Panther II]] were already underway before the first Panther had even seen combat. But from May to June 1943, work on the Panther II ceased as the focus was shifted to expanding production of the original Panther tank. It is not clear if there was ever an official cancellation \u2013 this may have been because the Panther II upgrade pathway was originally started at Hitler's insistence. The direction that the design was headed would not have been consistent with Germany's need for a mass-produced tank, which was the goal of the Reich Ministry of Armament and War Production.\n\nOne Panther II chassis was completed and eventually captured by the U.S.; it is now on display at the Patton Museum in Fort Knox. An Ausf G turret is mounted on this chassis.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 50\u201355</ref><ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 169\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Panther Ausf. F===\nAfter the Panther II project died, a more limited upgrade of the Panther was planned, centred around a re-designed turret. The Ausf F variant was intended for production in April 1945, but the end of war ended these plans.\n\nThe earliest known redesign of the turret was dated 7 November 1943 and featured a narrow gun mantlet behind a {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick turret front plate. Another design drawing by Rheinmetall dated 1 March 1944 reduced the width of the turret front even further; this was the ''Turm-Panther (Schmale Blende)'' (Panther with narrow gun mantlet).<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 103\u2013108</ref> Several experimental ''Schmalt\u00fcrme'' (literally: \"narrow turrets\") were built in 1944 with modified versions of the production Panther's 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70 standard gun, which were given the designation of KwK 44/1. A few were captured and shipped back to the U.S. and Britain. One badly damaged turret is on display at the [[Bovington Tank Museum]]. It had been used as a post-war range target until its historical significance was recognised.\n\n[[File:Munster Panther Ausf F Schmalturm 1(dark1).jpg|right|thumb|Model of Panther II (with 80 cm diameter Tiger II wheels and transport tracks) with proposed ''Schmalturm'', with stereoscopic sight bulges on the turret sides]]\n\nThe ''Schmalturm'' had a much narrower front face of {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} armour sloped at 20 degrees; side turret armour was increased to {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} from {{convert|45|mm|abbr=on}}; roof turret armour increased to {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} from {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on}}; and a bell shaped gun mantlet similar to that of the [[Tiger II]] was used. This increased armour protection also had a slight weight saving due to the overall smaller size of the turret.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 103-113</ref>\n\nThe Panther Ausf F would have had the ''Schmalturm'', with its better ballistic protection, and an extended front hull roof which was slightly thicker. The Ausf F's ''Schmalturm'' was to have a built-in [[Coincidence rangefinder|stereoscopic rangefinder]] \u2014 using twin matching armored blisters, one on each turret side, much like the Americans' post-war [[M47 Patton#Design|M47 Patton]] tank \u2014 and lower weight than the original turrets. A number of Ausf F hulls were built at Daimler-Benz and Ruhrstahl-Hattingen steelworks; there is no evidence that any completed Ausf F saw service before the end of the war.\n\nProposals to equip the ''Schmalturm'' with the 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 43 L/71 were made from January to March 1945. These would have likely equipped future German tanks but none were built, as the war ended.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 103\u2013115</ref>\n\n===E-50===\n{{main|Entwicklung series#E-50}}\nThe E series of experimental tanks \u2014 E-10, E-25, E-50, E-75, E-100 (the numbers designated their weight class) \u2013 was proposed to further streamline production with an even greater sharing of common parts and simplification of design. In this scheme, the Panther tank would have been replaced by the E-50. A [[Belleville washer]]-based, hull sidemount suspension system was proposed to replace the complex and costly dual torsion bar system. The ''Schmalturm'' would have been used, likely with a variant of the 8.8&nbsp;cm L/71 gun.<ref>Spielberger 1993, 156\u2013158</ref>\n\n===Derived vehicles===\n{{main|List of Panzer V variants}}\n[[File:Bergepanther mg 7814.jpg|thumb|''Bergepanther'' on display at Saumur armour museum]]\n* [[Jagdpanther]] \u2013 heavy ''[[Jagdpanzer]]''-style [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|casemate]]-hulled tank destroyer with the 8.8&nbsp;cm L/71\n* ''Befehlspanzer'' Panther \u2013 command tank with additional radio equipment\n* ''Beobachtungspanzer'' Panther \u2013 [[Artillery observer|artillery observation]] tank; dummy gun; armed with only two [[MG 34]]\n* ''Bergepanther'' \u2013 [[armoured recovery vehicle]]\n* ''[[Flakpanzer Coelian]]'' \u2013 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun project, planned to be armed with twin [[Flak 43]] 37&nbsp;mm AA guns in an armoured turret<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-v-panther-sd-kfz-171.htm |title=Panzerkampfwagen V Panther Sd.

The French postwar [[AMX 50]] tank prototype was indirectly influenced by it through the [[Entwicklung series]], but never entered series production. It is claimed that the Panther was arguably a forebear to the modern [[main battle tank]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=Panther vs. Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944|date=2008|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|isbn=9781846032929|page=75}}</ref>\n\nThe Panther itself also saw some limited use outside the German military, both before and after 1945.\n\n[[File:Captured Axis Vehicles PzV.jpg|thumb|A captured Panther in Red Army use]]\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15771.jpg|thumb|British officers ride on a captured Panther tank in Italy June 1944, with early \"letterbox\" hull gun aperture]]\n\nDuring the war, the [[Red Army]] employed a number of captured Panthers. These were repainted with prominent Soviet emblems and tactical markings to avoid [[friendly fire]] incidents.<ref>Sharp, Charles C., ''\"Red Hammers\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII'', Nafziger, 1998, p 122</ref> Unlike captured Panzer IVs and StuGs, the Soviets generally only used Panthers and Tigers that had been captured intact and used them until they broke down, as they were too complex and difficult to transport for repair. Panzer IVs and StuGs, on the other hand, were so numerous in terms of spare parts and easy to repair that they could be used over a much longer period in combat conditions.\n\nDuring March\u2013April 1945, Bulgaria received 15 Panthers of various makes (D, A, and G variants) from captured and overhauled Soviet stocks; they only saw limited (training) service use. They were dug down, with automotive components removed, as pillboxes along the Bulgarian-Turkish border as early as the late 1940s. The final fate of these pillbox Panthers is unknown, but sources indicate that they were replaced and scrapped in the 1950s.\n\nIn May 1946, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] received 13 Panther tanks from the USSR. They were initially used by the 1st Armoured Brigade, but in 1947 the equipment was ceded to the Soviet-organized \"[[Tudor Vladimirescu Division]]\", which was transformed from a volunteer infantry division into an armoured one. The Panther tank was officially known as T-V (T-5) in the army inventory. These tanks were in poor condition and remained in service until about 1950, by which time the Romanian Army had received T-34-85 tanks. All of the tanks were scrapped by 1954. The tanks were different models: Ausf A, Ausf D, and Ausf G.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.41</ref> They were shown to the public in 1948, during the 1 May parade in Bucharest, painted with Romanian markings. Until 1950, the T-V (T-5) was the heaviest tank available to the Romanian Army.\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]] armored platoon on a captured German Panther, 2 August 1944 in Warsaw.]]\n\nDuring the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the Polish [[Home Army]] captured and used two Panther tanks.

It had the [[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|ordnance inventory designation]] of '''Sd.Kfz. 171'''. It was designated as the '''''Panzerkampfwagen'' V ''Panther''''' until 27 February 1944, when [[Hitler]] ordered that the Roman numeral \"V\" be deleted. Contemporary English language reports sometimes refer to it as the '''\"Mark V\"'''.\n\nThe Panther was intended to counter the Soviet [[T-34]] and to replace the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier [[Tiger I]] until the end of the war. It is considered one of the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection, although its reliability was less impressive.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Stephen A.|title=Panther Medium Tank 1942-45|date=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|isbn=1841765430|pages=41\u201343}}</ref>\n\nThe Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I, it had more efficient frontal hull armour,<ref name=\"WWII Ballistics\">{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D|title=WWII Ballistics: Armor and Gunnery|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=13}}</ref> better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire. The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long range engagements, but did not provide enough [[high explosive]] firepower against infantry.{{sfn|Zaloga|2015|p=202}}\n\nThe Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive, were simplifications made to improve production rates and address raw material shortages. The overall design remained described by some as \"over-engineered\".{{sfn|Zaloga|2008|p=95-6}}{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}}{{sfn|Docherty|2013|p=124}} The Panther was rushed into combat at the [[Battle of Kursk]] despite numerous unresolved technical problems, leading to high losses due to mechanical failure. Most design flaws were rectified [[World War II#Allies gain momentum .281943.E2.80.9344.29|by late 1943 and early 1944]], though the bombing of  production plants, increasing shortages of high quality alloys for critical components, shortage of fuel and training space, and the declining quality of crews all impacted the tank's effectiveness.\n\nThough officially classified as a medium tank, its weight is more like that of a heavy tank, as its weight of 44.8 tons puts it roughly in the same category as the American [[M26 Pershing]] (41.7 tons), British [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] (40.7 tons) and the Soviet [[IS-2]] (46 tons) heavy tanks. The tank had a very high [[power-to-weight ratio]], making it highly mobile regardless of its tonnage. Its weight still caused [[Military Logistics|logistical]] problems, such as an inability to cross certain bridges.\n\nThe naming of Panther production variants did not, unlike most German tanks, follow alphabetical order: the initial variant, Panther \"D\" (''Ausf.&nbsp;D''), was followed by \"A\" and \"G\" variants.\n\n==Development and production==\n===Design===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14589, Albert Speer, Panzer T-34.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albert Speer]] examines a T-34 in June 1943]]\n\nThe Panther was born out of a project started in 1938 to replace the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks. The initial requirements of the [[VK 20]] series called for a fully tracked vehicle weighing 20 tonnes and design proposals by Krupp, Daimler Benz and MAN ensued. These designs were abandoned and Krupp dropped out of the competition entirely as the requirements increased to a vehicle weighing 30 tonnes, a direct reaction to the encounters with the Soviet [[T-34]] and [[KV-1 tank]]s and against the advice of [[Waffenamt|Wa Pruef 6]].<ref group=Notes>Wa Pruef 6 was the tank and motorized equipment department of the German arms procurement agency, the ''Waffenamt''.</ref><ref name=\"Schiffer Military History\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=16}}</ref> The T-34 outclassed the existing models of the Panzer III and IV.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 4\">{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=T-34/76 Medium Tank 1941-1945|date=1994|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1855323826|page=17}}</ref> At the insistence of General [[Heinz Guderian]], a special tank commission was created to assess the T-34.<ref>Doyle and Jentz 1997, p. 4</ref> Among the features of the Soviet tank considered most significant were the sloping armour, which gave much improved shot deflection and also increased the effective armour thickness against penetration, the wide track, which improved mobility over soft ground, and the {{convert|76.2|mm|abbr=on|0}} gun, which had good armour penetration and fired an effective high explosive round. [[Daimler-Benz]] (DB), which designed the successful Panzer III and [[StuG III]], and [[MAN SE|Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N\u00fcrnberg AG]] (MAN) were given the task of designing a new 30- to 35-tonne tank, designated VK 30.02, by April 1942.\n\nThe [[VK 3002(DB)|\"VK 30.02(DB)\"]] design resembled the T-34 in its [[Chassis|hull]] and [[gun turret|turret]] and was also to be powered by a diesel engine. It was driven from the rear drive sprocket with the turret situated forward. The incorporation of a diesel engine promised increased operational range, reduced flammability and allowed for more efficient use of petroleum reserves. Hitler himself considered a diesel engine imperative for the new tank.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 9\"/> DB's proposal used an external [[leaf spring]] suspension, in contrast to the MAN proposal of twin torsion bars. Wa Pruef 6's opinion was that the leaf spring suspension was a disadvantage and that using torsion bars would allow greater internal hull width. It also opposed the rear drive because of the potential for track fouling. Daimler Benz still preferred the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension as it resulted in a silhouette about {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} shorter and rendered complex shock absorbers unnecessary. The employment of a rear drive provided additional crew space and also allowed for a better slope on the front hull, which was considered important in preventing penetration by armour-piercing shells.<ref name=\"Schiffer Military History\"/>\n\nThe MAN design embodied a more conventional configuration, with the transmission and drive sprocket in the front and a centrally mounted turret. It had a [[petrol]] engine and eight torsion-bar suspension axles per side. Because of the torsion bar suspension and the drive shaft running under the turret basket, the MAN Panther was higher and had a wider hull than the DB design. The [[Henschel]] firm's design concepts for their [[Tiger I]] tank's suspension/drive components, using its characteristic ''Schachtellaufwerk'' format \u2013 large, overlapping, interleaved road wheels with a \"slack-track\" using no return rollers for the upper run of track, also features shared with almost all German military half-track designs since the late 1930s \u2013 were repeated with the MAN design for the Panther. These multiple large, rubber-rimmed steel wheels distributed ground pressure more evenly across the track. The MAN proposal also complemented Rheinmetall's already designed turret modified from that of the VK 45.01 (H),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=18}}</ref> and used a virtually identical Maybach V12 engine to the Tiger I heavy tank's Maybach HL230 powerplant model.\n\nThe two designs were reviewed from January to March 1942. ''Reichminister'' [[Fritz Todt|Todt]], and later, his replacement [[Albert Speer]], both recommended the DB design to Hitler because of its advantages over the initial MAN design. At the final submission, MAN refined its design, having learned from the DB proposal apparently through a leak by a former employee in the Wa Pruef 6, senior engineer Heinrich Ernst Kniepkamp and others.<ref name=\"Forczyk 2007, p 9\">{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=9}}</ref>  On 5 March 1942, [[Albert Speer]] reported that Hitler considered the Daimler-Benz design to be superior to MAN's design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military History|isbn=0-88740-812-5|page=17}}</ref> A review by a special commission appointed by Hitler in May 1942 selected the MAN design. Hitler approved this decision after reviewing it overnight. One of the principal reasons given for this decision was that the MAN design used an existing turret designed by [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]], while the DB design would have required a brand new turret and engine to be designed and produced, delaying the commencement of production.<ref>Jentz 1995, p 16\u201318.</ref> This time-saving measure compromised the subsequent development of the design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=feIBwIK6DA0C&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22this+decision+was+a+disaster+for+the+Panther+tank+development+program+since+it+meant+that+getting+the+best+tank+possible+to+German+tankers+was+set+as&source=bl&ots=go9eCfntTx&sig=moljVGuL7aYSDQaq43nUZw8BbZU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QC5GVKW3Aqf2iQLImYCoAQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22this%20decision%20was%20a%20disaster%20for%20the%20Panther%20tank%20development%20program%20since%20it%20meant%20that%20getting%20the%20best%20tank%20possible%20to%20German%20tankers%20was%20set%20as&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAlbert Speer recounts in his autobiography ''Inside the Third Reich''\n{{quote|Since the Tiger had originally been designed to weigh fifty tons but as a result of Hitler's demands had gone up to fifty seven tons, we decided to develop a new thirty ton tank whose very name, Panther, was to signify greater agility. Though light in weight, its motor was to be the same as the Tiger's, which meant it could develop superior speed. But in the course of a year Hitler once again insisted on clapping so much armor on it, as well as larger guns, that it ultimately reached forty eight tons, the original weight of the Tiger.<ref>Speer 2009, p. 325</ref>}}\n\n===Production===\nA mild steel [[prototype]] of the MAN design was produced by September 1942 and, after testing at [[Kummersdorf]], was officially accepted. It was put into immediate production. The start of production was delayed, mainly because of a shortage of specialized machine tools needed for the machining of the hull. Finished tanks were produced in December and suffered from reliability problems as a result. The demand for this tank was so high that the manufacturing was soon expanded beyond MAN to include Daimler-Benz (Berlin-[[Marienfelde]], former [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|DMG]] plant), Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen [[Hanover]] (MNH, subsidiary of Eisenwerk W\u00fclfel/[[Hanomag]]) and the Tiger I's original designer, [[Henschel & Sohn]] in Kassel.\n\nThe initial production target was 250 tanks per month at the MAN plant at [[Nuremberg]]. This was increased to 600 per month in January 1943. Despite determined efforts, this figure was never reached due to disruption by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing, and manufacturing and resource bottlenecks. Production in 1943 averaged 148 per month. In 1944, it averaged 315 a month (3,777 having been built that year), peaking with 380 in July and ending around the end of March 1945, with at least 6,000 built in total. Front-line combat strength peaked on 1 September 1944 at 2,304 tanks, but that same month a record number of 692 tanks were reported lost.<ref name=\"Jentz284\">Jentz 1996, p. 284</ref>\n\nThe Allies directed bombing at the common chokepoint for both Panther and Tiger production: the Maybach engine plant. This was [[Bombing of Friedrichshafen in World War II|bombed the night of 27/28 April 1944]] and production halted for five months. A second factory had already been planned, the [[Auto Union]] [[Chemnitz|Siegmar]] plant (the former [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] car factory), and this came on line in May 1944.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 182</ref> The targeting of Panther factories began with a bombing raid on the DB plant on 6 August 1944, and again on the night of 23/24 August. MAN was struck on 10 September, 3 October and 19 October 1944, and then again on 3 January and 20/21 February 1945. MNH was not attacked until 14 and 28 March 1945.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 121</ref>\n\nIn addition to interfering with tank production goals, the bombing forced a steep drop in the production of spare parts, which as a percentage of tank production dropped from 25\u201330 percent in 1943 to 8 percent in late 1944. This compounded the problems with reliability and with the numbers of operational Panthers, as tanks in the field had to be cannibalized for parts.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 13\u201314\n</ref>\n\n===Production figures===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3966-27, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|upright|Panther tank production line]]\n\nThe Panther was the third most [[German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|produced German armoured fighting vehicle]], after the Sturmgesch\u00fctz III assault gun/tank destroyer at 9,408 units, and the Panzer IV tank at 8,298 units.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Production by type<ref name=\"Panzer Tracts 23\">{{cite book |title=Panzer Tracts No.23 - Panzer Production from 1933 to 1945 |publisher=Panzer Tracts |author=Thomas L.

Hitler was briefed thoroughly on the comparison between the MAN and DB designs in the report by Guderian's tank commission. Armour protection appeared to be inadequate, while \"the motor mounted on the rear appeared to him correct\". He agreed that the \"decisive factor was the possibility of quickly getting the tank into production\". On 15 May 1942, Oberst Fichtner informed MAN that Hitler had decided in favour of the MAN Panther and ordered series production. The upper glacis plate was to be increased from {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}}. Hitler demanded that an increase to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} should be attempted and that at least all vertical surfaces were to be {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}; the turret front plate was increased from {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|page=18|isbn=0887408125}}</ref>\n\nThe Panther was rushed into combat before all of its teething problems had been corrected. Reliability was considerably improved over time, and the Panther proved to be a very effective fighting vehicle,<ref name=\"Armored Champion' p. 221\">Zaloga 2015, ''Armored Champion'' p. 221</ref> but some design flaws, such as its weak final drive units, were never corrected.\n\nThe crew had five members: driver, radio operator (who also fired the bow machine gun), gunner, loader, and commander.\n\n===Engine===\n\nThe first 250 Panthers were powered by a Maybach HL 210 P30 V-12 petrol engine, which delivered 650 [[metric horsepower|metric hp]] at 3,000 rpm and had three simple air filters.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 23. Some sources state that only a pre-production run of 20 Panthers used the HL 210 engine (Spielberger 1993 p. 27)</ref> Starting in May 1943, Panthers were built using the 700 metric horsepower (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm, 23.1&nbsp;litre [[Maybach]] [[Maybach HL230|HL 230 P30]] V-12 petrol engine. To save aluminium, the light alloy block used in the HL 210 was replaced by a cast iron block. Two multistage \"cyclone\" air filters were used to improve dust removal.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 36</ref><ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 36\u201352</ref> Due to the use of low grade petrol, the engine power output was reduced. With a capacity of {{convert|730|l|abbr=off}} of fuel, a fully fuelled Panther's range was {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} on surfaced roads and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} cross country.<ref name=\"Panzer Tracts 5-1\">{{cite book |title=Panzer Tracts No.5-1 - Panzerkampfwagen Panther Ausf. D|publisher=Panzer Tracts |author=Thomas L. Jentz and Hilary Louis Doyle |year=2003 |pages=5\u201372}}</ref>\n\nThe HL 230 P30 engine was a very compact [[tunnel crankcase]] design, and it kept the space between the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls to a minimum. The [[crankshaft]] was composed of seven \"discs\" or main [[Bearing (mechanical)|journals]], each with an outer race of [[Rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]], and a crankshaft pin between each disc. To reduce the length of the engine by an inch or so, and reduce [[Engine balance|unbalanced rocking moment]] caused by a [[V engine|normal offset-Vee type engine]], the two banks of 6 cylinders of the V-12 were not offset \u2013 the \"big ends\" of the [[connecting rod]]s of each cylinder pair in the \"V\" where they mated with the [[crankpin]] were thus at the same spot with respect to the engine block's length rather than offset; this required a [[Fork and blade connecting rod|\"fork and blade]]\" matched pair of connecting rods for each transversely oriented pair of cylinders. Usually, \"V\"-form engines have their transversely paired cylinders' connecting rods' \"big ends\" simply placed side by side on the crankpin, with their transverse pairs of cylinders offset slightly to allow the connecting rod big ends to attach side by side while still being in the cylinder bore centerline. This compact arrangement with the connecting rods was the source of considerable problems initially.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Blown head gaskets were another problem, which was corrected with improved seals in September 1943. Improved bearings were introduced in November 1943. An engine governor was also added in November 1943 that reduced the maximum engine speed to 2,500&nbsp;rpm. An eighth crankshaft bearing was added beginning in January 1944 to reduce motor failures.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nThe engine compartment was designed to be watertight so that the Panther could ford water obstacles; however, this made the engine compartment poorly ventilated and prone to overheating. The fuel connectors in early Panthers were not insulated, leading to the leakage of fuel fumes into the engine compartment, which caused engine fires. Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gases, which only partly solved the problem of engine fires.<ref>Spielberger 1993, p. 52</ref> Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 62</ref> Despite the risks of fire, the fighting compartment was relatively safe due to a solid firewall that separated it from the engine compartment.<ref>Green, 2012 p.199</ref>\n\nEngine reliability improved over time. A French assessment in 1947 of their stock of captured Normandy Panther A tanks concluded that the engine had an average life of {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and maximum life of {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Spielberger 1993 p. 161\">Spielberger 1993, p. 161</ref>\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-296-1652-35, Nordfrankreich, Montage am Pantherlaufwerk.jpg|thumb|''Schachtellaufwerk'' interleaved wheels on a Panther]]\n\nThe suspension consisted of front drive sprockets, rear idlers and eight double-interleaved rubber-rimmed steel road wheels on each side \u2013 in the so-called ''Schachtellaufwerk'' design, suspended on a dual torsion bar suspension. The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor Ernst Lehr, allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel over undulating terrain. The extra space required for the bars running across the length of the bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank. When damaged by mines, the torsion bars often required a welding torch for removal.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 22, 61, 122, 156</ref>\n\nThe Panther's suspension was overengineered, and the ''Schachtellaufwerk'' interleaved road wheel system made replacing inner road wheels time-consuming (though it could operate with missing or broken wheels). The interleaved wheels also had a tendency to become clogged with mud, rocks and ice, and could freeze solid overnight in [[Operation Barbarossa#Phase four|the harsh winter weather]] that followed the autumn ''[[rasputitsa]]'' mud season on the Eastern Front. Shell damage could cause the road wheels to jam together and become difficult to separate.<ref>Spielberger 1993, p. 72</ref> Interleaved wheels had long been standard on all German [[half-track]]s. The extra wheels did provide better flotation and stability, and also provided more armour protection for the thin hull sides than smaller wheels or non-interleaved wheel systems, but the complexity meant that no other country ever adopted this design for their tanks.<ref>Green 2000, p. 80</ref> \n\nThe Inspector General of Armored Troops reported in May 1944:\n\n{{quote|Tracks and Suspension:\nAfter a mileage of between 1500 km and 1800km the tracks have great wear. In many cases the  guide horns  of the tracks bend outward or break. In 4 cases, the tracks had to be replaced when a whole series of reinforcement  guide horns were broken.\n\nReasons :\nThe guide horns are probably too weak because they bend easily.\n\nDue to the constant operations as well as the shortage of spare parts, the bearing system has not been able to be maintained and repaired as it should. For this reason, the bearing system in the available tanks is in very poor condition and has sometimes caused track/suspension failures.<ref>http://www.panzer-elmito.org/tanques/panther/documentos/I-PzRgt2_22-4-1944_002.jpg</ref>}}\n\n\nIn September 1944, and again in March/April 1945, [[M.A.N.]] built a limited number of Panthers with overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rimmed 80&nbsp;cm diameter roadwheels originally designed for Henschel's [[Tiger II]] and late series Tiger I Ausf. E tanks. These steel-rimmed roadwheels were introduced from chassis number 121052 due to raw material shortages.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 133</ref>\n\n\nFrom November 1944 through February 1945, a conversion process began to use [[sleeve bearing]]s in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of [[ball bearings]]. The sleeve bearings were primarily used in the running gear; plans were also made to convert the transmission to sleeve bearings, but were not carried out due to the ending of Panther production.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\n===Steering and transmission===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-280-1096-33, Russland, Reparatur eines Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|upright|Repair of the transmission of a Panther]]\n\nSteering was accomplished through a seven-speed AK 7-200 [[synchromesh]] gearbox, designed by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen]] (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} for 1st gear up to {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} for 7th gear. The driver was expected to judge the sharpness of a turn ahead of time and shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 23, 33\u201334</ref> This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks.\n\nThe AK 7-200 transmission was also capable of pivot turns, but tests showed this was possible only when the ground resistance on both tracks was the same.<ref>{{cite web |title=Panther Trials |url=https://tankarchives.blogspot.com/2014/04/panther-trials.html |website=Tank Archives |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> This high-torque method of turning could cause failures of the final drive.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 30</ref>\n\nThe overstressed transmission system resulted in the third gear being stripped prematurely in its service life.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven J. |title=Panther vs Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944 |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-84908-727-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edbvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq=Panther+tank+transmission+replace&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXobjKtP_lAhUMT6wKHXLrDV4QuwUwAnoECAYQBg#v=onepage&q=Panther%20tank%20transmission%20replace&f=false |accessdate=23 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  This problem was compounded by alloy shortages which made gears more brittle and prone to failure.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/> This led to the complicated task of accessing the transmission which was fully enclosed by the Panther's frontal armor.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/>  In order to access the final drive the entire driver's compartment and transmission had to be disassembled<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/> and lifted out.  This is sharply contrasted with accessing the Sherman transmission which only required the armor cover to be unbolted in the front.<ref name=\"PanthervSherman\"/>\n\nThe Panther's main weakness was its final drive unit. The problems stemmed from several factors. The original MAN proposal had called for the Panther to have an [[epicyclic gearing]] (planetary) system in the final drive, similar to that used in the [[Tiger I]].<ref>Jentz 2000, pp. 13, 32, 35</ref> Germany suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting [[machine tools]] and, unlike the Tiger, the Panther was intended to be mass-produced. To achieve the goal of higher production rates, numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture. This process was aggressively pushed forward, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers, by the Chief Director of Armament and War Production, [[Karl-Otto Saur]] (who worked under, and later succeeded, ''Reichminister'' Speer). Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double spur system.<ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Although much simpler to produce, the double spur gears had inherently higher internal impact and stress loads, making them prone to failure under the high torque requirements of the heavy Panther tank.\n\n===Armour===\nInitial production Panthers had a [[Case hardening|face-hardened]] [[glacis]] plate (the main front hull armour piece), but as [[Shell (projectile)#Armor-piercing|armour-piercing capped rounds]] became the standard in all armies (thus defeating the benefits of face-hardening, which caused uncapped rounds to shatter), this requirement was deleted in March 1943. By August 1943, Panthers were being built only with a homogeneous steel glacis plate.<ref>Jentz 1995 p.29</ref> The front hull had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} of armour angled at 55 degrees from the vertical, welded but also interlocked with the side and bottom plates for strength. The combination of moderately thick and well-sloped armour meant that heavy Allied weapons, such as the Soviet [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]], [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|US 90 mm M3]]<ref>Armor-Piercing Ammunition for Gun, 90-mm, M3, Office of the Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D.C., 1945.</ref> were needed to assure penetration of the upper glacis at all combat ranges.<ref name=\"Jentz p. 127-129\">Jentz 1995, pp. 127\u2013129 Wa Pruef 1 penetration range tests 5 Oct 1944, and British Dept.

The thinner side armour was necessary to reduce the weight, but it made the Panther vulnerable to hits from the side by all Allied tank and anti-tank guns. German tactical doctrine for the use of the Panther emphasized the importance of flank protection.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 132</ref> {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[spaced armour]], known as ''Sch\u00fcrzen'', intended to provide protection for the lower side hull from Soviet anti-tank rifle fire, was fitted on the hull side.

G). The main gun used three different types of ammunition: [[APCBC]]-HE (''Pzgr. 39/42''), [[HE-Frag|HE]] (''Sprgr. 42'') and [[Shell (projectile)#APCR|APCR]] (''Pzgr. 40/42''), the last of which was usually in short supply. While it was of a calibre common on Allied tanks, the Panther's gun was the most powerful of World War II, due to the large propellant charge and the long barrel, which gave it a very high [[muzzle velocity]] and excellent armour-piercing qualities \u2014 among Allied tank guns of similar caliber, none had equivalent muzzle energy. Only the British [[Sherman Firefly]] conversion's [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder]] gun, of 3 inch (76.2mm) calibre, and a 55 calibre long (L/55) barrel, with its availability to fire APDS shot had more potential armor perforation power but was considerably less accurate owing to disturbances caused by the separation of shot and sabot and at a cost of less severe damage inside the target after perforation of the armor. The flat [[trajectory]] and accuracy of the full bore ammunition also made hitting targets much easier, since accuracy was less sensitive to errors in range estimation and increased the chance of hitting a moving target. The Panther's 75&nbsp;mm gun had more penetrating power than the main gun of the [[Tiger I]] heavy tank, the [[8.8 cm KwK 36|8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56]],<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 127\u2013129; Jentz 1997 ''Germany's Tiger Tanks \u2013 Tiger I and Tiger II: Combat Tactics'' pp. 13\u201314; comparison of penetration range data between the Panther and Tiger I</ref> although the larger 88&nbsp;mm projectile might inflict more damage if it did penetrate.<ref>Zetterling 2000, p. 61</ref> The 75mm HE round was inferior to the 88mm HE round used for infantry support, but was on par with most other 75mm HE rounds used by other tanks and assault guns.<ref>The 'German Explosive Ordnance (Projectiles and Projectile Fuzes) - Department of the Army Technical Manual TM-9-1985-3' shows that the 8.8 cm KwK 36 HE shell from the Tiger I contained 0.9 kg of amatol (3765 Kilojoules). The 7.5 cm KwK 42 HE shell from the Panther contained 0.650 kg of amatol (2720 Kilojoules). By contrast the 7.5 cm KwK 37 HE round contained 0.454 kg of amatol (1900 Kilojoules) and the 7.5 cm KwK 40 HE round contained 0.66 kg of amatol (2760 Kilojoules). https://archive.org/details/TM9-1985-3</ref>\n\nThe tank typically had two [[MG 34]] armoured fighting vehicle variant machine guns featuring an armoured barrel sleeve. An MG 34 machine gun was located co-axially with the main gun on the gun mantlet; an identical MG 34 was located on the glacis plate and fired by the radio operator. Initial Ausf. D and early Ausf. A models used a \"letterbox\" flap enclosing its underlying thin, vertical [[arrowslit]]-like aperture, through which the machine gun was fired.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 26</ref> In later Ausf. A and all Ausf. G models (starting in late November-early December 1943), a ball mount in the glacis plate with a K.Z.F.2 machine gun sight was installed for the hull machine gun.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 64</ref>\n\nInitial Ausf. D were equipped with the [[Nebelwurfger\u00e4t]] with the later Ausf. A and Ausf. G receiving the [[Nahverteidigungswaffe]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Turret===\n[[File:Panzerkampfwagen V A 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Panther with regular rounded mantlet]]\n[[File:Panzerkampfwagen V G 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Panther with flattened lower 'chin' mantlet]]\n\nThe front of the turret was a curved {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick cast armour mantlet. Its transverse-cylindrical shape meant that it was more likely to deflect shells, but the lower section created a [[shot trap]]. If a non-penetrating hit bounced downwards off its lower section, it could penetrate the thin forward hull roof armour, and plunge down into the front hull compartment.<ref>Doyle and Jentz 1997, p. 9</ref> Penetrations of this nature could have catastrophic results, since the compartment housed the driver and radio operator sitting along both sides of the massive gearbox and steering unit. Also, four magazines containing main gun ammunition were located between the driver/radio operator seats and the turret, directly underneath the gun mantlet when the turret was facing forward.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 124</ref>\n\nFrom September 1944, a slightly redesigned mantlet with a flattened and much thicker lower \"chin\" design started to be fitted to Panther Ausf G models, the chin being intended to prevent such deflections. Conversion to the \"chin\" design was gradual, and Panthers continued to be produced to the end of the war with the rounded gun mantlet.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 96\">Jentz 1995, p. 96</ref>\n\nThe Ausf A model introduced a new cast armour commander's cupola, replacing the forged cupola. It featured a steel hoop to which a third MG 34 or either the coaxial or the bow machine gun could be mounted for use in the anti-aircraft role.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nThe first Panthers (Ausf D) had a hydraulic motor that could traverse the turret at a maximum rate of one complete revolution per minute, independent of engine speed. This was improved in the Ausf A model with a hydraulic traverse powered by the engine; one full turn took 46 seconds at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm but only 15 seconds if the engine was running at 3,000 rpm.<ref name=\"Jentz 57-60-126\">Jentz 1995, pp. 57, 60, 126</ref> This arrangement was a weakness, as traversing the Panther's turret rapidly onto a target required close coordination between the gunner and driver, who had to run the engine to maximum speed. By comparison, the M4 Sherman's electrically or electro-hydraulically traversed turret rotated at up to 360 degrees in 15 seconds and was independent of engine speed, which gave it an advantage over the Panther in close-quarters combat.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 28</ref> A hand traverse wheel was provided for the Panther gunner to make fine adjustment of his aim.<ref name=\"Jentz 57-60-126\"/>\n\n===Ammunition storage===\nAmmunition storage for the main gun was a weak point. All the ammunition for the main armament was stored in the hull, with a significant amount stored in the sponsons. In the Ausf D and A models, 18 rounds were stored next to the turret on each side, for a total of 36 rounds. In the Ausf G, which had deeper sponsons, 24 rounds were stored on each side of the turret, for a total of 48 rounds. In all models, four rounds were also stored in the left sponson between the driver and the turret. An additional 36 rounds were stored inside the hull of the Ausf D and A models \u2013 27 in the forward hull compartment directly underneath the mantlet. In the Ausf G, the hull ammunition storage was reduced to 27 rounds total, with 18 rounds in the forward hull compartment. For all models, three rounds were kept under the turntable of the turret.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 88, 124</ref> The stowage of 52 rounds of ammunition in the side sponsons made this area the most vulnerable point on the Panther since penetration here usually led to [[Catastrophic kill|catastrophic ammunition fires]].<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs. Sherman'' p. 22</ref>\n\nThe loader was stationed in the right side of the turret. With the turret facing forward, he had access only to the right sponson and hull ammunition,<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 34</ref> and so these served as the main ready-ammunition bins.\n\n===Crew===\nThe Panther had 5 crew members, the commander, gunner, loader, driver and radio operator. The commander, loader and gunner were in the turret, While the driver and radio operator were in the hull of the vehicle. The driver sat always on the front-left side of the tank and next to him was the tank's machine gunner whose job it was to operate the radio.\n\n==Combat use==\nPanthers were supplied to form ''Panzer Abteilung'' 51 (Tank Battalion 51) on 9 January, and then ''Panzer Abteilung'' 52 on 6 February 1943.<ref>Jentz 1996, pp. 55, 58.</ref>\n\nThe first production Panther tanks were plagued with mechanical problems. The engine was dangerously prone to overheating and suffered from connecting rod or bearing failures. Petrol leaks from the fuel pump or [[carburettor]], as well as motor oil leaks from gaskets, produced fires in the engine compartment; which resulted in the total writeoff of three Panthers due to fires.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Germany's Panther Tank|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|page=133|isbn=0887408125}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Forczyk|first1=Robert|title=Panther vs. T-34: Ukraine 1943|date=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 84603 149 6|page=33}}</ref> Transmission and final drive breakdowns were the most common and difficult to repair. A large list of other problems were detected in these early Panthers, and so from April through May 1943 all Panthers were shipped to Falkensee and N\u00fcrnberg for a major rebuilding program. This did not correct all of the problems, so a second program was started at Grafenwoehr and Erlangen in June 1943. Reliability improved with the Ausf. A and later G of the Panther, with availability rates going from an average of 37% by end of 1943<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 95</ref> to an average of 54% in 1944.<ref>Zaloga 2015, ''Armored Champion'' p. 221, 223</ref> By mid-1944, the Panther was at its peak performance and widely regarded as the most formidable tank on the battlefield.<ref name=\"Armored Champion' p. 221\"/>\n\n===Eastern Front===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-244-2321-34, Ostfront-S\u00fcd, Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|Panther on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], 1944.]]\n<!---[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J24359, Rum\u00e4nien, Kolonne von Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|right|Panther tanks of the [[Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division]] advance in the area of [[Ia\u015fi]], [[Romania]] in 1944.]]--->\n\nThe Panther tank was seen as a necessary component of [[Battle of Kursk|Operation Citadel]], and the attack was delayed several times because of their mechanical problems and to receive more Panthers, with the eventual start date of the battle only six days after the last Panthers had been delivered to the front. This resulted in major problems in Panther units during the [[Battle of Kursk]], as tactical training at the unit level, coordination by radio, and driver training were all seriously deficient.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\">Jentz 1995, p. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\nIt was not until 23\u201329 June 1943 that a total of 200 rebuilt Panthers were finally issued to Panther Regiment von Lauchert, of the XLVIII Panzer Corps (4 Panzer Army).

[[Heinz Guderian]] sent in the following preliminary assessment of the Panthers:\n\n{{quote|Due to enemy action and mechanical breakdowns, the combat strength sank rapidly during the first few days. By the evening of 10 July there were only 10 operational Panthers in the front line. 25 Panthers had been lost as total writeoffs (23 were hit and burnt and two had caught fire during the approach march). 100 Panthers were in need of repair (56 were damaged by hits and mines and 44 by mechanical breakdown). 60 percent of the mechanical breakdowns could be easily repaired. Approximately 40 Panthers had already been repaired and were on the way to the front. About 25 still had not been recovered by the repair service ... On the evening of 11 July, 38 Panthers were operational, 31 were total write-offs and 131 were in need of repair. A slow increase in the combat strength is observable. The large number of losses by hits (81 Panthers up to 10 July) attests to the heavy fighting.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, p. 130-132\"/>}}During Zitadelle the Panthers claimed 267 destroyed tanks.<ref>Frieser, P. 159.

Thus, a report on 11 August 1943 showed that the number of total write-offs in Panthers swelled to 156, with only 9 operational. The German Army was forced into a fighting retreat, and increasingly lost Panthers in combat as well as from abandoning and destroying damaged vehicles.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995 p. 134\"/>\n\nThe Panther demonstrated its capacity to destroy any Soviet armoured fighting vehicle from long distance during the Battle of Kursk, and had a very high overall kill ratio.<ref>Healy 2008, p. 170</ref> It constituted less than seven percent of the estimated 2,400\u20132,700 total armoured fighting vehicles deployed by the Germans in this battle,<ref>Healy 2008, pp. 161\u2013165</ref> and its effectiveness was limited by its mechanical problems and the in-depth layered defence system of the Soviets at Kursk. Its greatest historical role in the battle may have been a highly negative one\u2014its contribution to the decisions to delay the original start of [[Operation Zitadelle]] for a total of two months, time which the Soviets used to build up an enormous concentration of minefields, anti-tank guns, trenches and artillery defences.<ref>Healy 2008, pp. 64\u201372</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-124-12A, Russland, Infanterie und Panzer im Kampf.jpg|thumb|left|An early Panther Ausf. D supporting infantry on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front.]]]]\n\nAfter the losses of the Battle of Kursk, the German Army went into a permanent state of retreat from the Red Army. The numbers of Panthers were slowly built up again on the Eastern Front, and the operational percentage increased as reliability improved. In March 1944 Guderian reported: \"Almost all the bugs have been worked out\", although many units continued to report significant mechanical problems, especially with the final drive.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 139\u2013142</ref> The greatly outnumbered Panthers came to be used as mobile reserves to fight off major attacks.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 142\u2013144</ref>\n\nThe highest total number of operational Panthers on the Eastern Front was achieved in September 1944, when some 522 were listed as operational out of a total of 728. Throughout the rest of the war Germany continued to keep the great majority of Panther forces on the Eastern Front, where the situation progressively worsened for them. The last recorded status, on 15 March 1945, listed 740 on the Eastern Front, of which 361 were operational.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 143</ref> By this time the Red Army had entered East Prussia and was advancing through Poland.\n\nIn August 1944 Panthers were deployed during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] as mobile artillery and troop support.

From June through August 1944, an additional seven Panther regiments were sent into France, reaching a maximum strength of 432 in a status report dated 30 July 1944.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 147\u2013152</ref>\n\nThe majority of the German tank forces in Normandy \u2013 six and a half divisions \u2013 were drawn into fighting the Anglo-Canadian forces of the [[21st Army Group]] around the town of Caen. The numerous operations undertaken to secure the town became collectively known as the [[Battle of Caen]]. While there were areas of heavy wooded [[bocage]] around Caen, most of the terrain was open fields which allowed the Panther to engage the attacking enemy armour at long range \u2014 its combination of superior armour and firepower allowed it to engage at distances from which the Shermans could not respond.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 193</ref> Conversely, by the time of the Normandy Campaign, British divisional Anti-tank Regiments were well equipped with the excellent 17-pounder gun, and some US-supplied M10 tank destroyers had their 3-inch gun replaced with the 17pdr (giving the [[17pdr SP Achilles]]), making it equally as perilous for Panthers to attack across these same fields. The British had begun converting regular [[M4 Shermans]] to carry the 17-pounder gun (nicknamed [[Sherman Firefly|Firefly]]) prior to the D-Day landings. While limited numbers meant that during Normandy usually not more than one Sherman in each troop of four tanks was a Firefly variant, the lethality of the gun against German armour made them priority targets for German gunners.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. forces, facing one and a half German ''panzer'' divisions, mainly the ''Panzer Lehr'' Division, struggled in the heavy, low-lying bocage terrain west of Caen. Like the Sherman. the Panther struggled in the bocage country of Normandy, and was vulnerable to side and close-in attacks in the built-up areas of cities and small towns.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' pp. 177\u2013179</ref> The commander of the ''Panzer Lehr'' Division, Gen.

By the end of the war, he had some 80 tank kills claimed.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 38</ref>\n\nHistorian Steven Zaloga observed that the Panther's performance in the Ardennes operation against American M4 Shermans was disappointing for a vehicle of its technical specifications, given the Panther boasted superior armor and armament to the Sherman. Zaloga argues that this was down to the fact that at this point in the war, the quality of German tank crews had fallen and most Panther crews were inexperienced with minimal training. The lack of training exacerbated the Panther's technical weaknesses (poor power train durability and a lack of fuel and spare parts), resulting in many Panthers breaking down which were unable to be salvaged. Thus while a Panther was superior to a Sherman in the hands of an experienced crew, inadequate training, coupled with Sherman numerical superiority, resulted in a poor combat performance for the vehicle during the offensive.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs Sherman'' p. 5</ref>\n\n===Fortification===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-587-2267-24, Italien, befestigte Stellung, Inspektion.jpg|thumb|''Pantherturm'' fortification in Italy, mid 1944.]]\n\nFrom 1943, Panther turrets were mounted in fixed fortifications; some were normal production models, but most were made specifically for the task, with additional roof armour to withstand artillery fire.

After taking two years to catch up with German tank design in Africa, the British were wary of falling behind yet again. They had developed the excellent [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder anti-tank gun]], but did not yet have a vehicle in service that could fit this large gun into its turret. For its part, the U.S. Army did not believe that the Panther would be a significant problem, and did not foresee their armoured forces having to fight pitched engagements against large numbers of Panthers. The Panther was not seen in combat by the Western Allies until [[Operation Shingle|early 1944 at Anzio]] in Italy, where Panthers were employed in small numbers. Until just before [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Panther was thought to be another heavy tank that would not be built in large numbers.\n\nShortly before D-Day, Allied intelligence reported that large numbers of Panthers were being used in the panzer divisions, and an attempt was made to investigate Panther production. Using [[German tank problem|a statistical analysis of the serial numbers on the road wheels]] on two captured tanks, U.S. intelligence estimated Panther production for February 1944 to be 270 units, much greater than what had been anticipated. This estimate was very accurate, especially compared to previous methods, as German records after the war showed production of Panthers for the month of February 1944 was 276. This indicated that the Panther would be encountered in much larger numbers than had previously been thought.<ref>Ruggles and Brodie, pp. 82\u201383</ref> In the planning for the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], the U.S. Army expected to face a handful of German heavy tanks alongside large numbers of Panzer IVs. At this point, it was too late to prepare to face the Panther. As it turned out, 38% of the German tanks in Normandy were Panthers, whose frontal armour could not be penetrated by the 75&nbsp;mm guns of the US [[M4 Sherman]].\n\n[[File:Sherman Firefly 9-08-2008 15-05-43.JPG|left|thumb|A preserved Sherman Firefly Mk Ic (2008); its gun barrel is painted with the [[countershading]] pattern used to disguise its length]]\nThe British were more astute in their recognition of the danger posed by the increasing armour strength of German tanks. Work on a more powerful anti-tank gun had started in 1941, and the tanks to use it in 1942. When these programmes were delayed, a stop-gap solution was found. The 17-pdr could through modifications be fitted to a Sherman, and orders for this [[Sherman Firefly]] were placed in 1943. By the time of the Normandy invasion, 340 Sherman Fireflies were available to the Commonwealth armoured divisions. The British lobbied for American production lines to be modified to produce Fireflies, but these suggestions were declined by the U.S. Army, in part due to the poor performance of British tank designs in North Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Maj. Gen I. D. White. Exhibit No. 1: \"Comparison of US equipment with Similar German Equipment\". Report for Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force. 20 March 1945</ref> There were also 200 interim [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger tanks]] with the 17-pounder and other improved tank designs were under development. British and Commonwealth tank units in Normandy were initially equipped at the rate of one Firefly in a troop with three Shermans or [[Cromwell tank|Cromwells]]. This ratio increased until, by the end of the war, half of the British Shermans were Fireflies. The [[Comet tank|Comet]] with a gun similar to the 17-pounder had also replaced the 75&nbsp;mm gun Sherman in some British units. The 17-pounder with [[APCBC]] shot was more or less equivalent in performance to the Panther's 75&nbsp;mm gun, but superior with [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] shot.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Panther vs. Sherman'' p. 28</ref>\n\nAt the time, U.S. armour doctrine was dominated by the head of Army Ground Forces, Gen. [[Lesley McNair]]. An artilleryman by trade, he believed that tanks should concentrate on infantry support and exploitation roles and avoid enemy tanks, leaving them to be dealt with by the [[tank destroyer]] force, which was a mix of towed anti-tank guns and lightly armoured fighting vehicles with open top turrets with 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) ([[M10 tank destroyer]]), 76&nbsp;mm ([[M18 Hellcat]]) or later, 90&nbsp;mm ([[M36 tank destroyer]]) guns. This doctrine led to a lack of urgency in the U.S. Army to upgrade the armour and firepower of the M4 Sherman tank, which had previously done well against the most common German tanks \u2013 Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs \u2013 in Africa and Italy. As with the Soviets, the German adoption of thicker armour and the [[7.5 cm KwK 40]] in their standard armoured fighting vehicles prompted the U.S. Army to develop the more powerful 76&nbsp;mm version of the M4 Sherman tank in April 1944. Development of a heavier tank, the [[M26 Pershing]], was delayed mainly by McNair's insistence on \"battle need\" and emphasis on producing only reliable, well-tested weapons, a reflection of America's {{convert|3000|mi|km|abbr=on}} supply line to Europe.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' pp. 43\u201348, 72\u201377, 115\u2013116, 120\u2013125</ref>\n\nAn AGF (Armored Ground Forces) policy statement of November 1943 concluded the following:\n\n{{quote|The recommendation of a limited proportion of tanks carrying a 90mm gun is not concurred in for the following reasons: The M4 tank has been hailed widely as the best tank of the battlefield today.&nbsp;... There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank. There can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank-vs.-tank duel-which is believed to be unsound and unnecessary. Both British and American battle experience has demonstrated that the antitank gun in suitable numbers is the master of the tank.&nbsp;... There has been no indication that the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against German Mark VI tank.<ref>AGF policy statement. Chief of staff AGF. November 1943. MHI</ref>}}\n\nU.S. awareness of the inadequacies of their tanks grew only slowly. All U.S. M4 Shermans that landed in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75&nbsp;mm gun. The general purpose 75&nbsp;mm M4 gun could not penetrate the Panther from the front at all, although it could penetrate various parts of the Panther from the side at ranges from {{convert|400|to|2600|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The 76&nbsp;mm gun could also not penetrate the front hull armour of the Panther, but could penetrate the Panther turret mantlet at very close range.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 127</ref> In August 1944, the [[HVAP]] (high velocity armour-piercing) 76&nbsp;mm round was introduced to improve the performance of the 76&nbsp;mm M4 Shermans. With a tungsten core, this round could still not penetrate the Panther glacis plate, but could punch through the Panther mantlet at {{convert|730|to|910|m|yard|abbr=on}}, instead of the usual {{convert|91|m|yard|abbr=on}} for the normal 76&nbsp;mm round. Tungsten production shortages meant that this round was always in short supply, with only a few available per tank, and some M4 Sherman units never received any.<ref>Zaloga 2008 ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nWhereas Sherman tanks used a high flash powder, making it easier for German tankers to spot them, German tanks used a low flash powder, making it harder for Allied crews to spot them.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Shermans, even though they were around 15 tons lighter than Panthers, had worse cross country mobility due to their narrower tracks. A US corporal stated:\n\n{{quote|I saw where some MkV tanks crossed a muddy field without sinking the tracks over five inches, where we in the M4 started across the same field the same day and bogged down.<ref>Brig. Gen. J.H. Collier. Maj. Gen I. D. White.

It was very effective against the Panther's front turret and side.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 218</ref>\n\nThe high U.S. tank losses in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] against a force largely of Panther tanks brought about a clamour for better armour and firepower. At General Eisenhower's request, only 76&nbsp;mm gun-armed M4 Shermans were shipped to Europe for the remainder of the war. Small numbers of the M26 Pershing were also rushed into combat in late February 1945.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbot'' pp. 268\u2013269, 287\u2013290</ref> A dramatic newsreel film was recorded by a U.S. Signal Corps cameraman of an M26 stalking and then blowing up a Panther in the city of Cologne, after the Panther had knocked out two M4 Shermans.<ref>Zaloga 2008, ''Armored Thunderbolt'' p. 289</ref>\n\nThe production of Panther tanks and other German tanks dropped off sharply after January 1945, and eight of the Panther regiments still on the Western Front were transferred to the Eastern Front in February 1945. The result was that, for the rest of the war during 1945, the greatest threats to the tanks of the Western Allies were no longer German tanks, but infantry anti-tank weapons, such as the [[Panzerschreck]] and [[Panzerfaust]], infantry anti-tank guns, such as the ubiquitous [[7.5 cm Pak 40]], and tank destroyers, such as the [[Marder III|Marder]], StuG III, [[StuG IV]], and [[Jagdpanzer]]. A German Army status report dated 15 March 1945 showed 117 Panthers left in the entire Western Front, of which only 49 were operational.<ref>Jentz 1995, p. 153</ref>\n\n==Further development==\n<!-- Note: The above heading is used in [[Template:WWIIGermanAFVs]] to point to Panther II.

The turret on display was not originally fitted to this hull and was installed later.]]\n{{Main|Panther II tank}}\n\nThe early impetus for upgrading the Panther came from the concern of Hitler and others that it lacked sufficient armour. Hitler had already insisted on an increase in its armour once, early in its design process in 1942. Discussions involving Hitler in January 1943 called for further increased armour; initially referred to as Panther 2 (it became the Panther II after April 1943). This upgrade increased the thickness of the glacis plate to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}}, the side armour to {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}}, and the top armour to {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}}. Production of the Panther 2 was slated to begin in September 1943.\n\nOn 10 February 1943, Dr. Wiebecke (chief design engineer for M.A.N.) suggested thoroughly redesigning the Panther II and incorporating Tiger components such as the steering gears, final drive, entire suspension and turret based on Eastern Front experience. Total weight would increase to more than 50 metric tons.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Germany's Panther Tank. The Quest for Combat Supremacy|last = Jentz|first = Thomas L.|publisher = Schiffer Publishing Ltd.|year = 1995|isbn = 0-88740-812-5|location = Atglen, PA|pages = 51}}</ref> Another meeting on 17 February 1943 focused on sharing and standardizing parts between the [[Tiger II]] tank and the Panther II, such as the transmission, all-steel eighty centimeter diameter roadwheels (only overlapping and not interleaved as the original ''Schachtellaufwerk'' roadwheel design used) and running gear. Additional meetings in February began to outline the various components, including a suggestion to adopt the King Tiger's hard-hitting 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 43 L/71 gun, but it was ultimately decided to continue use of the production Panther's 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70 gun.<ref>Thomas L. Jentz \"Germany's Panther Tank: The Quest for Combat Supremacy, Development Modifications, Rare Variants, Characteristics, Combat Accounts\"</ref> In March 1943, MAN indicated that the first prototype would be completed by August 1943. A number of engines were under consideration, among them the new Maybach HL 234 fuel-injected engine (900&nbsp;hp operated by an 8-speed hydraulic transmission) and the [[BMW 003]] aviation turbojet-derived, [[GT 101]] [[turboshaft]] powerplant, planned to be of some 1,150 shaft horsepower output and weighing only some 450&nbsp;kg (992&nbsp;lb) without its transmission, only some 38% of the weight of the Panther's standard [[Maybach HL230]] V-12 gasoline fueled piston engine.\n\nThus, plans to replace the original Panther design with the [[Panther II tank|Panther II]] were already underway before the first Panther had even seen combat. But from May to June 1943, work on the Panther II ceased as the focus was shifted to expanding production of the original Panther tank. It is not clear if there was ever an official cancellation \u2013 this may have been because the Panther II upgrade pathway was originally started at Hitler's insistence. The direction that the design was headed would not have been consistent with Germany's need for a mass-produced tank, which was the goal of the Reich Ministry of Armament and War Production.\n\nOne Panther II chassis was completed and eventually captured by the U.S.; it is now on display at the Patton Museum in Fort Knox. An Ausf G turret is mounted on this chassis.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 50\u201355</ref><ref>Spielberger 1993, pp. 169\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Panther Ausf. F===\nAfter the Panther II project died, a more limited upgrade of the Panther was planned, centred around a re-designed turret. The Ausf F variant was intended for production in April 1945, but the end of war ended these plans.\n\nThe earliest known redesign of the turret was dated 7 November 1943 and featured a narrow gun mantlet behind a {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick turret front plate. Another design drawing by Rheinmetall dated 1 March 1944 reduced the width of the turret front even further; this was the ''Turm-Panther (Schmale Blende)'' (Panther with narrow gun mantlet).<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 103\u2013108</ref> Several experimental ''Schmalt\u00fcrme'' (literally: \"narrow turrets\") were built in 1944 with modified versions of the production Panther's 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70 standard gun, which were given the designation of KwK 44/1. A few were captured and shipped back to the U.S. and Britain. One badly damaged turret is on display at the [[Bovington Tank Museum]]. It had been used as a post-war range target until its historical significance was recognised.\n\n[[File:Munster Panther Ausf F Schmalturm 1(dark1).jpg|right|thumb|Model of Panther II (with 80 cm diameter Tiger II wheels and transport tracks) with proposed ''Schmalturm'', with stereoscopic sight bulges on the turret sides]]\n\nThe ''Schmalturm'' had a much narrower front face of {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} armour sloped at 20 degrees; side turret armour was increased to {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} from {{convert|45|mm|abbr=on}}; roof turret armour increased to {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} from {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on}}; and a bell shaped gun mantlet similar to that of the [[Tiger II]] was used. This increased armour protection also had a slight weight saving due to the overall smaller size of the turret.<ref>Jentz 1995 p. 103-113</ref>\n\nThe Panther Ausf F would have had the ''Schmalturm'', with its better ballistic protection, and an extended front hull roof which was slightly thicker. The Ausf F's ''Schmalturm'' was to have a built-in [[Coincidence rangefinder|stereoscopic rangefinder]] \u2014 using twin matching armored blisters, one on each turret side, much like the Americans' post-war [[M47 Patton#Design|M47 Patton]] tank \u2014 and lower weight than the original turrets. A number of Ausf F hulls were built at Daimler-Benz and Ruhrstahl-Hattingen steelworks; there is no evidence that any completed Ausf F saw service before the end of the war.\n\nProposals to equip the ''Schmalturm'' with the 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 43 L/71 were made from January to March 1945. These would have likely equipped future German tanks but none were built, as the war ended.<ref>Jentz 1995, pp. 103\u2013115</ref>\n\n===E-50===\n{{main|Entwicklung series#E-50}}\nThe E series of experimental tanks \u2014 E-10, E-25, E-50, E-75, E-100 (the numbers designated their weight class) \u2013 was proposed to further streamline production with an even greater sharing of common parts and simplification of design. In this scheme, the Panther tank would have been replaced by the E-50. A [[Belleville washer]]-based, hull sidemount suspension system was proposed to replace the complex and costly dual torsion bar system. The ''Schmalturm'' would have been used, likely with a variant of the 8.8&nbsp;cm L/71 gun.<ref>Spielberger 1993, 156\u2013158</ref>\n\n===Derived vehicles===\n{{main|List of Panzer V variants}}\n[[File:Bergepanther mg 7814.jpg|thumb|''Bergepanther'' on display at Saumur armour museum]]\n* [[Jagdpanther]] \u2013 heavy ''[[Jagdpanzer]]''-style [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|casemate]]-hulled tank destroyer with the 8.8&nbsp;cm L/71\n* ''Befehlspanzer'' Panther \u2013 command tank with additional radio equipment\n* ''Beobachtungspanzer'' Panther \u2013 [[Artillery observer|artillery observation]] tank; dummy gun; armed with only two [[MG 34]]\n* ''Bergepanther'' \u2013 [[armoured recovery vehicle]]\n* ''[[Flakpanzer Coelian]]'' \u2013 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun project, planned to be armed with twin [[Flak 43]] 37&nbsp;mm AA guns in an armoured turret<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-v-panther-sd-kfz-171.htm |title=Panzerkampfwagen V Panther Sd.

These were repainted with prominent Soviet emblems and tactical markings to avoid [[friendly fire]] incidents.<ref>Sharp, Charles C., ''\"Red Hammers\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII'', Nafziger, 1998, p 122</ref> Unlike captured Panzer IVs and StuGs, the Soviets generally only used Panthers and Tigers that had been captured intact and used them until they broke down, as they were too complex and difficult to transport for repair. Panzer IVs and StuGs, on the other hand, were so numerous in terms of spare parts and easy to repair that they could be used over a much longer period in combat conditions.\n\nDuring March\u2013April 1945, Bulgaria received 15 Panthers of various makes (D, A, and G variants) from captured and overhauled Soviet stocks; they only saw limited (training) service use. They were dug down, with automotive components removed, as pillboxes along the Bulgarian-Turkish border as early as the late 1940s. The final fate of these pillbox Panthers is unknown, but sources indicate that they were replaced and scrapped in the 1950s.\n\nIn May 1946, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] received 13 Panther tanks from the USSR. They were initially used by the 1st Armoured Brigade, but in 1947 the equipment was ceded to the Soviet-organized \"[[Tudor Vladimirescu Division]]\", which was transformed from a volunteer infantry division into an armoured one. The Panther tank was officially known as T-V (T-5) in the army inventory. These tanks were in poor condition and remained in service until about 1950, by which time the Romanian Army had received T-34-85 tanks. All of the tanks were scrapped by 1954. The tanks were different models: Ausf A, Ausf D, and Ausf G.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.41</ref> They were shown to the public in 1948, during the 1 May parade in Bucharest, painted with Romanian markings. Until 1950, the T-V (T-5) was the heaviest tank available to the Romanian Army.\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]] armored platoon on a captured German Panther, 2 August 1944 in Warsaw.]]\n\nDuring the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the Polish [[Home Army]] captured and used two Panther tanks.

A third form of currency also existed for creators, known as \"developer tokens\", which were earned when a user purchases an item with \"promo-credits\". Credits could be purchased online using actual currency directly from IMVU. Credits could also be purchased on IMVU gift cards available from retail outlets such as department stores. The credits are being used by members to purchase virtual items like fashion pieces (hair, clothes, skins, and accessories), pets, and 3D scenes such as homes, clubs, and open landscapes. Furniture could also be purchased the same way and placed into unlocked rooms, but there were also rooms that have some furniture included in them as well as locked rooms that include furniture that cannot be removed.\n\nPromotional credits, abbreviated to \u201cpredits\u201d, were a second form of currency distributed to members by IMVU and could be obtained by participating in various \"Partner\" promotions and a few activities that IMVU provides. With relation to a standard free or full member, promo-credits were similar to standard credits. A given number of credits equates, promo-credits could not be used to purchase items as gifts for other members and may not be traded back to an IMVU re-seller for actual currency. Promo-credits used to purchase a virtual product were exchanged into \"developer tokens\", also known as \"dev tokens\".

A third form of currency also existed for creators, known as \"developer tokens\", which were earned when a user purchases an item with \"promo-credits\". Credits could be purchased online using actual currency directly from IMVU. Credits could also be purchased on IMVU gift cards available from retail outlets such as department stores. The credits are being used by members to purchase virtual items like fashion pieces (hair, clothes, skins, and accessories), pets, and 3D scenes such as homes, clubs, and open landscapes. Furniture could also be purchased the same way and placed into unlocked rooms, but there were also rooms that have some furniture included in them as well as locked rooms that include furniture that cannot be removed.\n\nPromotional credits, abbreviated to \u201cpredits\u201d, were a second form of currency distributed to members by IMVU and could be obtained by participating in various \"Partner\" promotions and a few activities that IMVU provides. With relation to a standard free or full member, promo-credits were similar to standard credits. A given number of credits equates, promo-credits could not be used to purchase items as gifts for other members and may not be traded back to an IMVU re-seller for actual currency. Promo-credits used to purchase a virtual product were exchanged into \"developer tokens\", also known as \"dev tokens\". The purchase transferred the promo-credits into developer tokens but netted a single developer token per purchase when promo-credits were used regardless of the price of the product purchased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imvu.com/catalog/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpbb2&file=viewtopic.php&t=90662&highlight= |title=IMVU |publisher=IMVU |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nMany IMVU users are content creators, creating and selling products in the IMVU catalog.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Users also devoted time to customizing their individual homepages, setting up public and private rooms, creating and participating in user groups (similar to forums but personalized via the owner), and participating in the Community forums.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Additionally, there are numerous user-produced third-party websites providing additional forums and resources to the IMVU community.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} IMVU users are also able to conduct peer review on virtual products waiting to be submitted into the IMVU catalog, with a reward of 10 promo-credits per product review.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/09/64969|last=Marie|first=Nakiya|date=September 16, 2004|title=Instant Messaging Goes Graphical}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Imvu}}\n[[Category:Virtual reality communities]]\n[[Category:Windows instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Redwood City, California]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c7:bd8a:1200:3074:662f:88ec:2878", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Nothing)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU"}

Lucille and her husband had six children together, which included four daughters (Sidney, Fredrica, Gillian, and Alexia) and two sons (Channing and Graham). Lucille worked as a claims clerk in the New York State Division of Employment, Buffalo (1958\u201360), and as literature assistant in the Office of Education in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1960\u201371). Writer [[Ishmael Reed]] introduced Lucille to Clifton while he was organizing the Buffalo Community Drama Workshop. Fred and Lucille Clifton starred in the group's version of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', which was called \"poetic and sensitive\" by the ''Buffalo Evening News''.\n\nIn 1966, Reed took some of Clifton's poems to [[Langston Hughes]], who included them in his anthology ''The Poetry of the Negro''. In 1967, the Cliftons moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland.<ref name=\"Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48\"/> Her first poetry collection, ''Good Times'', was published in 1969, and listed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the year's ten best books.

Growing up she was told by her mother, \"Be proud, you're from Dahomey women!\"<ref>Lupton (2006), p. 60.</ref>  She cites as one of her ancestors the first black woman to be \"legally hanged\" for manslaughter in the state of [[Kentucky]] during the time of [[Slavery in the United States]].  Girls in her family are born with an extra finger on each hand, a genetic trait known as [[polydactyly]]. Lucille's two extra fingers were amputated surgically when she was a small child, a common practice at that time for reasons of superstition and social stigma. Her \"two ghost fingers\" and their activities became a theme in her poetry and other writings.  Health problems in her later years included painful [[gout]] which gave her some difficulty in walking.\n\nHer series of children's books about a young black boy began with 1970's ''Some of the Days of Everett Anderson.'' Everett Anderson, a recurring character in many of her books, spoke in African American English and dealt with real life social problems. Her work features in anthologies such as ''My Black Me: A Beginning Book of Black Poetry'' (ed. Arnold Adoff), ''A Poem of Her Own: Voices of American Women Yesterday and Today'' (ed. Catherine Clinton), ''Black Stars: African American Women Writers'' (ed. Brenda Scott Wilkinson), ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'' (ed. [[Margaret Busby]]), and ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' (eds Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]]). Studies about Clifton's life and writings include ''Wild Blessings: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton'' (LSU Press, 2004) by Hilary Holladay, and ''Lucille Clifton: Her Life and Letters'' (Praeger, 2006) by Mary Jane Lupton.\n\n=== ''Two-Headed Woman'': \"homage to my hips\" ===\nIn 1980 Clifton published \"homage to my hips\" in her book of poems, ''Two-Headed Woman''. ''Two-Headed Woman'' won the 1980 Juniper Prize and was characterized by its \"dramatic tautness, simple language \u2026 tributes to blackness, [and] celebrations of women\", which are all traits reflected in the poem \"homage to my hips\".<ref>Jessie Carney Smith, ''Notable Black American Women, Book 2'' (Detroit, MI: Gale Research Inc., 1996), 110.\n</ref> This particular collection of poetry also marks the beginning of Clifton's interest in depicting the \"transgressive black body.\"<ref>Michael Bennett, Vanessa D. Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body: Self-representations by African American Women'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2001), 127.</ref> \"homage to my hips\" was preceded by the poem \"homage to my hair\" \u2013 and acts as a complementary work that explores the relationship between African-American women and men and aimed to reinvent the negative stereotypes associated with the black female body. \"Homage to my hips\" and \"homage to my hair\" both relate the African-American body to mythological powers \u2013 a literary technique common among many literary works by African American women. Jane Campbell poses the idea that \"the specific effect of mythmaking upon race relations \u2026 constitutes a radical act, inviting the audience to subvert the racist mythology that thwarts and defeats Afro-Americans, and to replace it with a new mythology rooted in the black perspective.\"<ref>Bennett & Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body'' (2001), 126.</ref> Therefore, Clifton utilizes \"homage to my hips\" to celebrate the African-American female body as a source of power, sexuality, pride, and freedom. body slam cousins from ky'mari back of stones half more than one time in the show in collgewood I have no right to be a diva.By:ky'Mari backser\n\n==Awards==\nLucille Clifton received a Creative Writing Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1970 and 1973, and a grant from the [[Academy of American Poets]].

Lucille and her husband had six children together, which included four daughters (Sidney, Fredrica, Gillian, and Alexia) and two sons (Channing and Graham). Lucille worked as a claims clerk in the New York State Division of Employment, Buffalo (1958\u201360), and as literature assistant in the Office of Education in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1960\u201371). Writer [[Ishmael Reed]] introduced Lucille to Clifton while he was organizing the Buffalo Community Drama Workshop. Fred and Lucille Clifton starred in the group's version of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', which was called \"poetic and sensitive\" by the ''Buffalo Evening News''.\n\nIn 1966, Reed took some of Clifton's poems to [[Langston Hughes]], who included them in his anthology ''The Poetry of the Negro''. In 1967, the Cliftons moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland.<ref name=\"Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48\"/> Her first poetry collection, ''Good Times'', was published in 1969, and listed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the year's ten best books. From 1971 to 1974, Clifton was poet-in-residence at [[Coppin State University|Coppin State College]] in Baltimore. From 1979 to 1985, she was [[Poet Laureate]] of the state of [[Maryland]].<ref name=\"MSA\">[http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/poet.html \"Maryland Poets Laureate\"], webpage of [http://www.msa.md.gov/ Maryland State Archives], retrieved May 27, 2007.</ref> From 1982 to 1983, she was visiting writer at the Columbia University School of the Arts and at [[George Washington University]].

From 1995 to 1999, she was a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]]. In 2006, she was a fellow at [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nShe died in Baltimore on February 13, 2010.\n\n==Poetic work==\n[[File:For Cornelia.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque outside the [[New York Public Library]] ]]\n\nLucille Clifton traced her family's roots to the West African Kingdom of [[Dahomey]], now the [[Republic of Benin]].  Growing up she was told by her mother, \"Be proud, you're from Dahomey women!\"<ref>Lupton (2006), p. 60.</ref>  She cites as one of her ancestors the first black woman to be \"legally hanged\" for manslaughter in the state of [[Kentucky]] during the time of [[Slavery in the United States]].  Girls in her family are born with an extra finger on each hand, a genetic trait known as [[polydactyly]]. Lucille's two extra fingers were amputated surgically when she was a small child, a common practice at that time for reasons of superstition and social stigma. Her \"two ghost fingers\" and their activities became a theme in her poetry and other writings.  Health problems in her later years included painful [[gout]] which gave her some difficulty in walking.\n\nHer series of children's books about a young black boy began with 1970's ''Some of the Days of Everett Anderson.'' Everett Anderson, a recurring character in many of her books, spoke in African American English and dealt with real life social problems. Her work features in anthologies such as ''My Black Me: A Beginning Book of Black Poetry'' (ed. Arnold Adoff), ''A Poem of Her Own: Voices of American Women Yesterday and Today'' (ed. Catherine Clinton), ''Black Stars: African American Women Writers'' (ed. Brenda Scott Wilkinson), ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'' (ed. [[Margaret Busby]]), and ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' (eds Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]]). Studies about Clifton's life and writings include ''Wild Blessings: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton'' (LSU Press, 2004) by Hilary Holladay, and ''Lucille Clifton: Her Life and Letters'' (Praeger, 2006) by Mary Jane Lupton.\n\n=== ''Two-Headed Woman'': \"homage to my hips\" ===\nIn 1980 Clifton published \"homage to my hips\" in her book of poems, ''Two-Headed Woman''. ''Two-Headed Woman'' won the 1980 Juniper Prize and was characterized by its \"dramatic tautness, simple language \u2026 tributes to blackness, [and] celebrations of women\", which are all traits reflected in the poem \"homage to my hips\".<ref>Jessie Carney Smith, ''Notable Black American Women, Book 2'' (Detroit, MI: Gale Research Inc., 1996), 110.\n</ref> This particular collection of poetry also marks the beginning of Clifton's interest in depicting the \"transgressive black body.\"<ref>Michael Bennett, Vanessa D. Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body: Self-representations by African American Women'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2001), 127.</ref> \"homage to my hips\" was preceded by the poem \"homage to my hair\" \u2013 and acts as a complementary work that explores the relationship between African-American women and men and aimed to reinvent the negative stereotypes associated with the black female body. \"Homage to my hips\" and \"homage to my hair\" both relate the African-American body to mythological powers \u2013 a literary technique common among many literary works by African American women. Jane Campbell poses the idea that \"the specific effect of mythmaking upon race relations \u2026 constitutes a radical act, inviting the audience to subvert the racist mythology that thwarts and defeats Afro-Americans, and to replace it with a new mythology rooted in the black perspective.\"<ref>Bennett & Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body'' (2001), 126.</ref> Therefore, Clifton utilizes \"homage to my hips\" to celebrate the African-American female body as a source of power, sexuality, pride, and freedom.\n\n==Awards==\nLucille Clifton received a Creative Writing Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1970 and 1973, and a grant from the [[Academy of American Poets]]. She received the Charity Randall prize, the Jerome J. Shestack Prize from the ''[[American Poetry Review]]'', and an [[Emmy Award]]. Her children's book ''Everett Anderson's Good-bye'' won the 1984 [[Coretta Scott King Award]]. In 1988, Clifton became the first author to have two books of poetry named finalists for one year's [[Pulitzer Prize]]. (The award dates from 1918, the announcement of finalists from 1980.)<ref name=pulitzer/> She won the 1991/1992 [[Shelley Memorial Award]], the 1996 [[Lannan Literary Award for Poetry]], and for ''Blessing the Boats: New and Collected Poems 1988\u20132000'' the 2000 [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba2000/> From 1999 to 2005, she served on the Board of Chancellors of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. In 2007, she won the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]]; the $100,000 prize honors a living U.S. poet whose \"lifetime accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition.\" Clifton received the [[Robert Frost Medal]] for lifetime achievement from the Poetry Society of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/awards/frost_and_shelley/frost_winners/2010|title=Lucille Clifton, Winner of the 2010 Frost Medal|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n===Poetry collections===\n\n*''Good Times'', New York: Random House, 1969\n*''Good News About the Earth'', New York: Random House, 1972\n*''An Ordinary Woman'', New York: Random House, 1974)\n*''Two-Headed Woman'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], Amherst, 1980\n*''Good Woman: Poems and a Memoir: 1969\u20131980'', Brockport: BOA Editions, 1987 \u2014 finalist for the 1988 [[Pulitzer Prize]]<ref name=pulitzer/>\n*''Next: New Poems'', Brockport: [[BOA Editions, Ltd.]], 1987 \u2014finalist for the 1988 [[Pulitzer Prize]]<ref name=pulitzer>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction \"Fiction\"].
