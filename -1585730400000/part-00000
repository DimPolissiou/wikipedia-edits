Meanwhile, Richthofen prefers to call the Eastern parts of this region as Central Asia, and the whole as Inner Asia.<ref name=\"books.google.be\"/>\nNevertheless, these definitive origins were since overshadowed by the Russian definition, who colonized the dominant part of the region since the 19th Century and its definitions shaped the modern English understanding. The Russian definition has two distinct terms: ''\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Srednyaya Aziya'' or \"[[Middle Asia]]\", the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and ''\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Tsentralnaya Aziya'' or \"Central Asia\", the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia).\n\nThe most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], hence omitting [[Kazakhstan]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.\nSoon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia]]n Republics met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.\n\nThe [[UNESCO]] ''History of the Civilizations of Central Asia'', published in 1992, defines the region as \"Afghanistan, northeastern Iran, northern and central Pakistan, northern India, western China, Mongolia and the former Soviet Central Asian republics.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia.|date=1992-2005|publisher=Unesco|others=Dani, Ahmad Hasan., Masson, V.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]\nCentral Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018'&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017'&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast.

In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Men from Khiva.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Uzbek men from [[Khiva]], ca. 1861\u20131880]]\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>C.E.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkestan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978.\n\nThe Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems.

Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.\n\nCentral Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]\u2014in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.\n\nPhotography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]] Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, \"Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva\", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nSome also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates.

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world's largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Central Asia.

Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science']]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure.

It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups.

In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science.

Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.

Between 2005 and 2014, Kazakhstan's share of scientific papers from the region grew from 35% to 56%.

Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual \u2013 from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion \u2013 and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== International cooperation ===\nThe five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. They are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{cite book |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have been members of the [[World Trade Organization]] since 1998, 2013 and 2015 respectively.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n== Territorial and regional data ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"|[[Country]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"|[[List of countries by area|Area]]<br />km\u00b2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"|[[List of countries by population|Population]]{{UN Population|ref}}<br />({{UN Population|Year}})\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"|[[List of countries by population density|Population density]]<br />per km<sup>2</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"|[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|Nominal GDP]] (2017)<br />\n!

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia ===\n{{Largest cities of Central Asia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Nur-Sultan]]\n| Kazakhstan\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

The Russian definition has two distinct terms: ''\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Srednyaya Aziya'' or \"[[Middle Asia]]\", the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and ''\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Tsentralnaya Aziya'' or \"Central Asia\", the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia).\n\nThe most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], hence omitting [[Kazakhstan]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.\nSoon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia]]n Republics met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets.

The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018'&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017'&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n=== Names of historical regions ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ariana]]\n* [[Bactria]]\n* [[Dahae|Dahistan]]\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\n* [[Khwarazm]]\n* [[Margiana]]\n* [[Parthia]]\n* [[Sogdia]]\n* [[Transoxiana]]\n* [[Turan]]\n* [[Turkestan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Men from Khiva.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Uzbek men from [[Khiva]], ca. 1861\u20131880]]\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>C.E.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkestan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978.\n\nThe Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems.

Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.\n\nCentral Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]\u2014in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.\n\nPhotography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]] Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, \"Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva\", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nSome also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates.

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[Equestrianism|Equestrian sports]] are traditional in Central Asia, with disciplines like [[endurance riding]], [[buzkashi]], [[dzhigit]] and [[kyz kuu]].\n\nThe Traditional game of [[Buzkashi]] is played throughout the Central Asian region, the countries sometimes organize Buzkashi competition amongst each other.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world's largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Central Asia.

Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science']]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups.

In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science.

Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.

In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.

Between 2005 and 2014, Kazakhstan's share of scientific papers from the region grew from 35% to 56%.

Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual \u2013 from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion \u2013 and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== International cooperation ===\nThe five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. They are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{cite book |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have been members of the [[World Trade Organization]] since 1998, 2013 and 2015 respectively.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n== Territorial and regional data ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"|[[Country]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"|[[List of countries by area|Area]]<br />km\u00b2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"|[[List of countries by population|Population]]{{UN Population|ref}}<br />({{UN Population|Year}})\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"|[[List of countries by population density|Population density]]<br />per km<sup>2</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"|[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|Nominal GDP]] (2017)<br />\n!

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

It is the capital of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] and the [[List of cities in Argentina by population|second most populous]] city in Argentina after Buenos Aires, with about 1.3 million inhabitants according to the 2010 census. It was founded on 6 July 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], who named it after [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. It was one of the first Spanish colonial capitals of the region that is now Argentina (the oldest city is [[Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1553). The [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest university of the country and the seventh to be inaugurated in [[Spanish America]]. It was founded in 1613 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Because of this, C\u00f3rdoba earned the nickname ''La Docta'' (\"the learned\").\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments preserved from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial rule]], especially buildings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The most recognizable is perhaps the [[Jesuit Block]] (Spanish: ''Manzana Jesu\u00edtica''), declared in 2000 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=995 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2000-11-30 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early 20th century (after the [[University of Buenos Aires]]), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. C\u00f3rdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as [[Cordobazo]] and La Reforma del '18 (known as [[University Revolution]] in English).\n\n==History==\n===First settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn 1570, Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] entrusted the Spanish settler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], with the task of populating and founding a settlement in the [[Punilla Valley]]. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the [[Comechingones]]. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at [[Villa Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Villa Mar\u00eda]].\nThe one hundred man expedition set foot on what today is C\u00f3rdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today [[Suqu\u00eda]]). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named C\u00f3rdoba de la Nueva Andaluc\u00eda, possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder's wife, originally from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on Francisco de Torres' advice.\n[[File:Primera traza de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the first map of C\u00f3rdoba (1577)]]\n\nThe settlement was inhabited by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|aboriginal people]] called [[Comechingones]], who lived in communities called Ayllus. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suqu\u00eda River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of seventy blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, it acquired a stable population. Its economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.\n\nIn 1599, the religious order of the [[Jesuits]] arrived in the settlement. They established a [[Novitiate]] in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of C\u00f3rdoba in 1613 (today [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]]), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five ''[[Jesuit Reductions|Reducciones]]'' in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]], Santa Catalina, [[Alta Gracia]] and Candelaria.\n\nThe farm and the complex, started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King [[Charles III of Spain]] that expelled them from the continent. They were then run by the [[Franciscan]]s until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.\nEach [[Estancia]] has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as [[Alta Gracia]], the closest to the Block.\n\n===Early European settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Rafael de Sobremonte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael de Sobremonte, 3rd Marquis of Sobremonte|Rafael de Sobremonte]], governor of C\u00f3rdoba from 1784 to 1799]]\n\nIn 1776, [[King Carlos III]] created the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], in which C\u00f3rdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of C\u00f3rdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba, [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]].\n\nAccording to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of [[Fernando VII]], attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the [[Liniers Counter-revolution]]. This position was not shared by the [[Dean Funes|Dean Gregorio Funes]], who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]].\n\nIn March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] for an independence resolution. C\u00f3rdoba sent [[Eduardo P\u00e9rez Bulnes]], [[Settler|Jer\u00f3nimo Salguero de Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera]], and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.\n\nThe 1820s belonged to [[caudillos]], since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.\n\nFinally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.\nFrom this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a [[Federal government|federal]] system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.\n\nTwo C\u00f3rdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor Juan Bautista Bustos, who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near C\u00f3rdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Paz]]. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of C\u00f3rdoba on the part of Francisco Ram\u00edrez and his [[Chile]]an ally, General [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]]. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], C\u00f3rdoba and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]; according to the 1822 census the total population of C\u00f3rdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Avenida Col\u00f3n de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) a\u00f1os 1900.png|thumb|Col\u00f3n Avenue, c. 1900.]]\n[[File:Avenida Olmos, C\u00f3rdoba (1943).jpg|thumb|Olmos Avenue (1943).]]\n[[File:Mapa relieve cordoba argentina.png|thumb|Topographical relief map of the city of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]] who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]; later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]]), and Spain (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]])\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The city's physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, C\u00f3rdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]], which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and [[Spain]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe development of the domestic market, the [[English settlement in Argentina|British investments]] that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the [[pampas]] rapidly industrialized the city. C\u00f3rdoba's industrial sector first developed from the need to transform [[raw materials]] such as leather, [[meats]] and [[wool]] for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |title=Cordoba.gov: ciudad hist\u00f3rica Ciudad Historica |publisher=Cordoba.gov.ar |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2014-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125609/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after [[World War II]] with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerot\u00e9cnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). C\u00f3rdoba was chosen as the site of The ''Instituto Aerot\u00e9cnico'' that later became the ''F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones''. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was ousted by a [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|coup in 1955]]. [[Lockheed Martin]] purchased FMA in 1995.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning C\u00f3rdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of C\u00f3rdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, C\u00f3rdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that deposed President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and the setting for the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'', a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]]. C\u00f3rdoba's current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Location of Cordoba City Argentina.svg|thumb|Location of C\u00f3rdoba.<br />1.

The city, adjoins in the northern territory with [[Col\u00f3n Department, C\u00f3rdoba|Col\u00f3n Department]] summarizing a total surface of 562. <!--<ref name=\"OBSCAP07\"/> see the other ref like this for explanation--->\n\n===Geology===\nThe city is located in the plain of the [[Pampa|Humid Pampa]], to the east of the oriental cord of C\u00f3rdoba Hills or Sierras Chicas, also known as the Sierras Cordobesas, which has an average height of 550 m.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.policiacordoba.gov.ar/Download/Apuntes_Geografia_e_Historia_de_Cordoba.pdf\n |title=Geograf\u00eda e historia de la Provincia de C\u00f3rdoba\n |accessdate=18 September 2008\n |format=PDF\n |publisher=Polic\u00eda de la Provincia de C\u00f3rdoba\n |language=Spanish\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920205837/http://www.policiacordoba.gov.ar/Download/Apuntes_Geografia_e_Historia_de_Cordoba.pdf\n |archivedate=20 September 2008\n}}\n</ref> It spreads at the foot of the mount, on both banks of the River Suqu\u00eda, and flows into the [[San Roque Lake|San Roque reservoir]]; from there, the [[Primero River]] goes east into the plains surrounding the city of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nOnce inside the city, the ''La Ca\u00f1ada'' stream meets the [[Rio Primero]] near the city centre area. Two kilometers to the east, ''Isla de los Patos'' (Ducks Island) was repopulated with ducks and swans in the 1980s. It was reported in March 2006 that a large number of ducks had died due to unspecified causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/EdicionImpresa/informaciongeneral/nota.asp?nota_id=792738 |title=lanacion.com.ar |publisher=lanacion.com.ar |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> Pollution caused by chemical waste is suspected as the cause, but [[avian influenza]] is also being investigated.\n\nBeyond the city limits, the river flows towards the Algarrobos swamp and ends its course on the southern coast of the [[Mar Chiquita, C\u00f3rdoba|Mar Chiquita]] (or Mar de Ansenuza) [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]. All in all, the river has a length of approximately {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} and carries, on average, 9.7 m\u00b3/s, with minimum of 2 m\u00b3/s and maximum of 24 m\u00b3/s<ref>[http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm Ramsar.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101060953/http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm |date=1 November 2008 }}</ref> with a peak during the summer months.\n\n[[Water pollution|Pollution of the water]] and of the riverbank is a major environmental issue in C\u00f3rdoba. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Periodic cleaning operations are carried out to increase the quality of the water and to preserve the viability of fishing, both in the San Roque reservoir area and downstream.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of the city of C\u00f3rdoba, and that of most of the province, is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), moderated by the Pampas winds, cold winds that blow from the South-western quadrant, which originate in [[Antarctica]].\n\nThere are four marked seasons. Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between {{convert|28|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and night between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.\n\nBy late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; after cold fronts, lows below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and highs below {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are recorded in this month.\nApril is significantly drier already; highs reach {{convert|24|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on average and lows {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.\nMay usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain expected. Highs average {{convert|21|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows average {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; however, when cold waves reach the area, highs may stay below {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows can be well below freezing.\n\nWinter lasts from late May till early September, and bring average highs of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows of {{convert|4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as \"Veranito\" (little summer) with highs of up to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2\u20133 days. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around {{convert|6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and daytime highs between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Snowfall is very rare in the city, but more frequent in the outskirts where the Sierras begin {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}; sleet may fall every once in a while. The record low temperature for C\u00f3rdoba is {{convert|-8.3|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. In June, only {{convert|3.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain are expected, compared to {{convert|168|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January.\n\nSpring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop {{convert|20|C-change|0|abbr=on}} from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.\nBy October, days are warm at {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but nights remain cold at {{convert|11|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.\n\nThe wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, C\u00f3rdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.\n\nThe variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: {{convert|750|mm|0|abbr=on}} / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum 17&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.\n\nDue to the extension of the [[metropolitan area]], there exists a difference of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C between the central area and the Greater C\u00f3rdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important [[heat island]]. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = C\u00f3rdoba Observatory, C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina (1981\u20132010, extremes 1961\u2013present)\n|single line = y\n|metric first = y\n|collapsed = y\n|Jan record high C = 41.6\n|Feb record high C = 41.2\n|Mar record high C = 39.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.2\n|May record high C = 35.5\n|Jun record high C = 32.8\n|Jul record high C = 34.3\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 41.1\n|Oct record high C = 42.0\n|Nov record high C = 41.5\n|Dec record high C = 43.5\n|year record high C = 43.5\n|Jan high C = 30.9\n|Feb high C = 29.6\n|Mar high C = 28.1\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 21.3\n|Jun high C = 18.7\n|Jul high C = 18.3\n|Aug high C = 21.1\n|Sep high C = 23.2\n|Oct high C = 26.6\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 30.3\n|year high C = 25.1\n|Jan mean C = 24.3\n|Feb mean C = 23.1\n|Mar mean C = 21.7\n|Apr mean C = 18.0\n|May mean C = 14.5\n|Jun mean C = 11.4\n|Jul mean C = 10.8\n|Aug mean C = 13.3\n|Sep mean C = 15.7\n|Oct mean C = 19.5\n|Nov mean C = 21.8\n|Dec mean C = 23.7\n|year mean C = 18.2\n|Jan low C = 18.5\n|Feb low C = 17.5\n|Mar low C = 16.4\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 9.4\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.5\n|Aug low C = 7.3\n|Sep low C = 9.5\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 15.6\n|Dec low C = 17.9\n|year low C = 12.5\n|Jan record low C = 7.6\n|Feb record low C = 7.5\n|Mar record low C = 2.5\n|Apr record low C = -0.5\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = -6.1\n|Jul record low C = -7.1\n|Aug record low C = -4.9\n|Sep record low C = -2.6\n|Oct record low C = 1.5\n|Nov record low C = 3.7\n|Dec record low C = 7.0\n|year record low C = -7.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 126.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 97.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 61.3\n|May precipitation mm = 18.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 8.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 35.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 154.6\n|year precipitation mm = 814.0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 5.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.6\n|Nov precipitation days = 10.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.7\n|year precipitation days = 88.6\n|Jan humidity = 66.3\n|Feb humidity = 69.5\n|Mar humidity = 72.6\n|Apr humidity = 72.3\n|May humidity = 71.4\n|Jun humidity = 70.1\n|Jul humidity = 65.5\n|Aug humidity = 58.0\n|Sep humidity = 55.9\n|Oct humidity = 58.0\n|Nov humidity = 60.3\n|Dec humidity = 63.6\n|year humidity = 65.3\n|Jan sun = 257.3\n|Feb sun = 229.6\n|Mar sun = 204.6\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 170.5\n|Aug sun = 204.6\n|Sep sun = 213.0\n|Oct sun = 238.7\n|Nov sun = 255.0\n|Dec sun = 251.1\n|year sun = 2533.9\n|Jan percentsun = 60\n|Feb percentsun = 62\n|Mar percentsun = 54\n|Apr percentsun = 55\n|May percentsun = 52\n|Jun percentsun = 49\n|Jul percentsun = 53\n|Aug percentsun = 60\n|Sep percentsun = 60\n|Oct percentsun = 60\n|Nov percentsun = 62\n|Dec percentsun = 57\n|year percentsun = 57\n|source 1 = [[Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (Argentina)|Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional]]<ref name = SMNclimatenormals>{{cite web\n| url = https://ssl.smn.gob.ar/dpd/observaciones/estadisticas.txt\n| title = Estad\u00edsticas Climatol\u00f3gicas Normales - per\u00edodo 1981-2010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=SMNextremes>\n{{cite web\n |url          = https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |title        = Clima en la Argentina: Guia Clim\u00e1tica por C\u00f3rdoba Obs.\n |work         = Caracterizaci\u00f3n: Estad\u00edsticas de largo plazo\n |publisher    = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language     = Spanish\n |accessdate   = 5 October 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904022616/https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |archive-date = 4 September 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/AG/87345.TXT\n| title = CORDOBA OBS Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Ingeniero Aeron\u00e1utico Ambrosio L.V.

The district is home to the Bank of C\u00f3rdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Mart\u00edn Square, the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of C\u00f3rdoba|Jesuit Block]] (declared UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]) and the Genaro P\u00e9rez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Col\u00f3n, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is the San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.\n\nDowntown C\u00f3rdoba is home of large shopping malls, notably [[Patio Olmos]]. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the [[French architecture|French architect]], [[Ernest Sanson]]. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum|Evita Per\u00f3n Museum of Fine Arts]] (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.\n\n[[New C\u00f3rdoba]] has a number of important avenues such as ''Yrigoyen'' and ''V\u00e9lez Sarsfield''. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.\n\n[[File:Puente parque de las tejas.JPG|thumb|Tejas Park at New C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nCiudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} [[Sarmiento Park]], the city's most important one. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in [[Argentina]], founded by Jesuits around 1622. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] is also famous for the \"Reforma Universitaria\", a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt lead to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from C\u00f3rdoba to [[Lima]] (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the [[National Technological University|UTN]], dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There are also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The ''C\u00f3rdoba Zoo'' is located in this district.\n\nLocated about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from downtown C\u00f3rdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood's economic activity centers around the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as \"Las Delicias\" and \"Lomas de los Carolinos\", are in the old Camino a La Calera.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe C\u00f3rdoba public transport system includes [[rail transport|trains]], [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[taxi]]s. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.\n\nThe city is served by the nation's third largest airport [[Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport]].\n\n=== Buses ===\nBuses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around C\u00f3rdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina.

It has about 105,000 students, and offers degrees in a wide variety of subjects in the sciences, applied sciences, social sciences, humanities and arts.\n\nThe [[National Technological University \u2013 C\u00f3rdoba Regional Faculty|C\u00f3rdoba Regional Faculty]] is a branch of the [[National Technological University]] in C\u00f3rdoba, offering undergraduate degrees in engineering (civil, electrical, electronic, industrial, mechanical, metallurgy, chemical and information), as well as master's degrees in engineering and business, and a PhD program in engineering and materials.\n\nThe [[Catholic University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest [[private university]] in C\u00f3rdoba, it has nearly 10,000 students.\n\nThe Aeronautic University Institute, run by the Argentine Air Force, offers degrees in aeronautical, telecommunications and electronic engineering, as well as information systems, accounting, logistics and administration.\n\nThe [[Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico C\u00f3rdoba]] was created jointly by the six universities located in the city to support technological development in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Montero |first1=Sergio |last2=Chapple |first2=Karen |year=2018 |title=Fragile Governance and Local Economic Development: Theory and Evidence from Peripheral Regions in Latin America |publisher=Routledge |page=131 |isbn=9781351589437}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the Universidad Siglo 21 and Universidad Blas Pascal are private universities in the city.\n\nThe Air Force Academy and the Air Force NCOs School are both located in the city outskirts.\n\nThere is an Italian international school, [[Escuela Dante Alighieri]].\n\nThe area once had a German school, Deutsche Schule Cordoba.<ref>\"[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/04/036/0403672.pdf Deutscher Bundestag 4.

Retrieved on 12 March 2016. p. 18/51.</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Literature ===\nThe Literary activity flourished in the city at the beginning of the last century. C\u00f3rdoba was the city of [[Leopoldo Lugones]], Arturo Capdevila and Marcos Aguinis, among many other prestigious writers. Among the city's best-known museums are the [[Caraffa Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 1916, and the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 2007. The [[Paseo del Buen Pastor]], a cultural center opened in 2007, features an art museum, as well as a shopping gallery devoted to local vintners, cheese makers, leather crafters and other artisans.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe typical music in C\u00f3rdoba is the ''[[cuarteto]]'', heard in many parties and pubs. Among the most popular cuarteto singers are [[La Mona Jim\u00e9nez|Carlos ''La Mona'' Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]], La Barra and Jean Carlos. The places they usually sing are named ''bailes'' (dances). One of the first groups was ''Cuarteto de Oro''.\n\nOther music styles popular with the youth are [[electronic music]] (or ''electro''), as well as [[reggaeton]]. These are commonly played at ''boliches'', as night clubs are known in Argentina. C\u00f3rdoba is sometimes referred to as \"the nightlife city\" (or \"the city that never sleeps\"), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage ''matin\u00e9es'' (dancing clubs).\n\nC\u00f3rdoba's rich musical culture also encompasses [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], rock and pop, in a variety of venues.\n\n[[Libertador Theatre|Teatro Libertador San Mart\u00edn]] regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:La Ca\u00f1ada de C\u00f3rdoba 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|[[Ca\u00f1ada of C\u00f3rdoba|La Ca\u00f1ada]] (an embanked stream), perhaps the most emblematic structure in C\u00f3rdoba.]]\n[[File:Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|The Cathedral]] appeared as a project in the first map of C\u00f3rdoba in 1577.]]\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era. In the centre, near the ''Plaza San Mart\u00edn'' square, is the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral|Cathedral]], whose altar is made of stone and silver from [[Potos\u00ed]]. Every ornament inside is made of gold and the roof is all painted with different images from the Bible. Another important historic building is the ''[[C\u00f3rdoba Cabildo|Cabildo]]'' (colonial government house), located next to the church. The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe first festival of the year is in February, the ''[[Carnival]]'', where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.\n\nThen in the middle of the year, on 20 July, ''Friends Day'' is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at ''Parque de las Naciones'' or ''Parque Sarmiento'' and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe last festival is ''Spring Day'', held on 21 September, which is Students' Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]]. There they can enjoy lots of activities like concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arco de C\u00f3rdoba 2007-11-16.jpg|The C\u00f3rdoba Gateway\nFile:Parque Sarmiento, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 1.jpg|[[Sarmiento Park]]\nFile:Av.

It is the capital of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] and the [[List of cities in Argentina by population|second most populous]] city in Argentina after Buenos Aires, with about 1.3 million inhabitants according to the 2010 census. It was founded on 6 July 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], who named it after [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. It was one of the first Spanish colonial capitals of the region that is now Argentina (the oldest city is [[Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1553). The [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest university of the country and the seventh to be inaugurated in [[Spanish America]]. It was founded in 1613 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Because of this, C\u00f3rdoba earned the nickname ''La Docta'' (\"the learned\").\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments preserved from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial rule]], especially buildings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The most recognizable is perhaps the [[Jesuit Block]] (Spanish: ''Manzana Jesu\u00edtica''), declared in 2000 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=995 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2000-11-30 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early 20th century (after the [[University of Buenos Aires]]), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. C\u00f3rdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as [[Cordobazo]] and La Reforma del '18 (known as [[University Revolution]] in English).\n\n==History==\n===First settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn 1570, Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] entrusted the Spanish settler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], with the task of populating and founding a settlement in the [[Punilla Valley]]. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the [[Comechingones]]. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at [[Villa Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Villa Mar\u00eda]].\nThe one hundred man expedition set foot on what today is C\u00f3rdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today [[Suqu\u00eda]]). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named C\u00f3rdoba de la Nueva Andaluc\u00eda, possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder's wife, originally from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on Francisco de Torres' advice.\n[[File:Primera traza de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the first map of C\u00f3rdoba (1577)]]\n\nThe settlement was inhabited by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|aboriginal people]] called [[Comechingones]], who lived in communities called Ayllus. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suqu\u00eda River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of seventy blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, it acquired a stable population. Its economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.\n\nIn 1599, the religious order of the [[Jesuits]] arrived in the settlement. They established a [[Novitiate]] in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of C\u00f3rdoba in 1613 (today [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]]), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five ''[[Jesuit Reductions|Reducciones]]'' in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]], Santa Catalina, [[Alta Gracia]] and Candelaria.\n\nThe farm and the complex, started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King [[Charles III of Spain]] that expelled them from the continent. They were then run by the [[Franciscan]]s until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.\nEach [[Estancia]] has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as [[Alta Gracia]], the closest to the Block.\n\n===Early European settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Rafael de Sobremonte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael de Sobremonte, 3rd Marquis of Sobremonte|Rafael de Sobremonte]], governor of C\u00f3rdoba from 1784 to 1799]]\n\nIn 1776, [[King Carlos III]] created the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], in which C\u00f3rdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of C\u00f3rdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba, [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]].\n\nAccording to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of [[Fernando VII]], attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the [[Liniers Counter-revolution]]. This position was not shared by the [[Dean Funes|Dean Gregorio Funes]], who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]].\n\nIn March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] for an independence resolution. C\u00f3rdoba sent [[Eduardo P\u00e9rez Bulnes]], [[Settler|Jer\u00f3nimo Salguero de Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera]], and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.\n\nThe 1820s belonged to [[caudillos]], since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.\n\nFinally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.\nFrom this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a [[Federal government|federal]] system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.\n\nTwo C\u00f3rdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor Juan Bautista Bustos, who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near C\u00f3rdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Paz]]. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of C\u00f3rdoba on the part of Francisco Ram\u00edrez and his [[Chile]]an ally, General [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]]. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], C\u00f3rdoba and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]; according to the 1822 census the total population of C\u00f3rdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Avenida Col\u00f3n de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) a\u00f1os 1900.png|thumb|Col\u00f3n Avenue, c. 1900.]]\n[[File:Avenida Olmos, C\u00f3rdoba (1943).jpg|thumb|Olmos Avenue (1943).]]\n[[File:Mapa relieve cordoba argentina.png|thumb|Topographical relief map of the city of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]] who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]; later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]]), and Spain (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]])\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The city's physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, C\u00f3rdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]], which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and [[Spain]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe development of the domestic market, the [[English settlement in Argentina|British investments]] that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the [[pampas]] rapidly industrialized the city. C\u00f3rdoba's industrial sector first developed from the need to transform [[raw materials]] such as leather, [[meats]] and [[wool]] for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |title=Cordoba.gov: ciudad hist\u00f3rica Ciudad Historica |publisher=Cordoba.gov.ar |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2014-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125609/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after [[World War II]] with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerot\u00e9cnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). C\u00f3rdoba was chosen as the site of The ''Instituto Aerot\u00e9cnico'' that later became the ''F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones''. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was ousted by a [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|coup in 1955]]. [[Lockheed Martin]] purchased FMA in 1995.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning C\u00f3rdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of C\u00f3rdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, C\u00f3rdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that deposed President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and the setting for the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'', a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]]. C\u00f3rdoba's current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Location of Cordoba City Argentina.svg|thumb|Location of C\u00f3rdoba.<br />1.

The city, adjoins in the northern territory with [[Col\u00f3n Department, C\u00f3rdoba|Col\u00f3n Department]] summarizing a total surface of 562. <!--<ref name=\"OBSCAP07\"/> see the other ref like this for explanation--->\n\n===Geology===\nThe city is located in the plain of the [[Pampa|Humid Pampa]], to the east of the oriental cord of C\u00f3rdoba Hills or Sierras Chicas, also known as the Sierras Cordobesas, which has an average height of 550 m.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.policiacordoba.gov.ar/Download/Apuntes_Geografia_e_Historia_de_Cordoba.pdf\n |title=Geograf\u00eda e historia de la Provincia de C\u00f3rdoba\n |accessdate=18 September 2008\n |format=PDF\n |publisher=Polic\u00eda de la Provincia de C\u00f3rdoba\n |language=Spanish\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920205837/http://www.policiacordoba.gov.ar/Download/Apuntes_Geografia_e_Historia_de_Cordoba.pdf\n |archivedate=20 September 2008\n}}\n</ref> It spreads at the foot of the mount, on both banks of the River Suqu\u00eda, and flows into the [[San Roque Lake|San Roque reservoir]]; from there, the [[Primero River]] goes east into the plains surrounding the city of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nOnce inside the city, the ''La Ca\u00f1ada'' stream meets the [[Rio Primero]] near the city centre area. Two kilometers to the east, ''Isla de los Patos'' (Ducks Island) was repopulated with ducks and swans in the 1980s. It was reported in March 2006 that a large number of ducks had died due to unspecified causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/EdicionImpresa/informaciongeneral/nota.asp?nota_id=792738 |title=lanacion.com.ar |publisher=lanacion.com.ar |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> Pollution caused by chemical waste is suspected as the cause, but [[avian influenza]] is also being investigated.\n\nBeyond the city limits, the river flows towards the Algarrobos swamp and ends its course on the southern coast of the [[Mar Chiquita, C\u00f3rdoba|Mar Chiquita]] (or Mar de Ansenuza) [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]. All in all, the river has a length of approximately {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} and carries, on average, 9.7 m\u00b3/s, with minimum of 2 m\u00b3/s and maximum of 24 m\u00b3/s<ref>[http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm Ramsar.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101060953/http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm |date=1 November 2008 }}</ref> with a peak during the summer months.\n\n[[Water pollution|Pollution of the water]] and of the riverbank is a major environmental issue in C\u00f3rdoba. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Periodic cleaning operations are carried out to increase the quality of the water and to preserve the viability of fishing, both in the San Roque reservoir area and downstream.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of the city of C\u00f3rdoba, and that of most of the province, is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), moderated by the Pampas winds, cold winds that blow from the South-western quadrant, which originate in [[Antarctica]].\n\nThere are four marked seasons. Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between {{convert|28|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and night between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.\n\nBy late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; after cold fronts, lows below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and highs below {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are recorded in this month.\nApril is significantly drier already; highs reach {{convert|24|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on average and lows {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.\nMay usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain expected. Highs average {{convert|21|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows average {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; however, when cold waves reach the area, highs may stay below {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows can be well below freezing.\n\nWinter lasts from late May till early September, and bring average highs of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows of {{convert|4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as \"Veranito\" (little summer) with highs of up to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2\u20133 days. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around {{convert|6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and daytime highs between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Snowfall is very rare in the city, but more frequent in the outskirts where the Sierras begin {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}; sleet may fall every once in a while. The record low temperature for C\u00f3rdoba is {{convert|-8.3|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. In June, only {{convert|3.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain are expected, compared to {{convert|168|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January.\n\nSpring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop {{convert|20|C-change|0|abbr=on}} from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.\nBy October, days are warm at {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but nights remain cold at {{convert|11|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.\n\nThe wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, C\u00f3rdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.\n\nThe variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: {{convert|750|mm|0|abbr=on}} / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum 17&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.\n\nDue to the extension of the [[metropolitan area]], there exists a difference of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C between the central area and the Greater C\u00f3rdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important [[heat island]]. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = C\u00f3rdoba Observatory, C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina (1981\u20132010, extremes 1961\u2013present)\n|single line = y\n|metric first = y\n|collapsed = y\n|Jan record high C = 41.6\n|Feb record high C = 41.2\n|Mar record high C = 39.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.2\n|May record high C = 35.5\n|Jun record high C = 32.8\n|Jul record high C = 34.3\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 41.1\n|Oct record high C = 42.0\n|Nov record high C = 41.5\n|Dec record high C = 43.5\n|year record high C = 43.5\n|Jan high C = 30.9\n|Feb high C = 29.6\n|Mar high C = 28.1\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 21.3\n|Jun high C = 18.7\n|Jul high C = 18.3\n|Aug high C = 21.1\n|Sep high C = 23.2\n|Oct high C = 26.6\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 30.3\n|year high C = 25.1\n|Jan mean C = 24.3\n|Feb mean C = 23.1\n|Mar mean C = 21.7\n|Apr mean C = 18.0\n|May mean C = 14.5\n|Jun mean C = 11.4\n|Jul mean C = 10.8\n|Aug mean C = 13.3\n|Sep mean C = 15.7\n|Oct mean C = 19.5\n|Nov mean C = 21.8\n|Dec mean C = 23.7\n|year mean C = 18.2\n|Jan low C = 18.5\n|Feb low C = 17.5\n|Mar low C = 16.4\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 9.4\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.5\n|Aug low C = 7.3\n|Sep low C = 9.5\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 15.6\n|Dec low C = 17.9\n|year low C = 12.5\n|Jan record low C = 7.6\n|Feb record low C = 7.5\n|Mar record low C = 2.5\n|Apr record low C = -0.5\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = -6.1\n|Jul record low C = -7.1\n|Aug record low C = -4.9\n|Sep record low C = -2.6\n|Oct record low C = 1.5\n|Nov record low C = 3.7\n|Dec record low C = 7.0\n|year record low C = -7.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 126.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 97.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 61.3\n|May precipitation mm = 18.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 8.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 35.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 154.6\n|year precipitation mm = 814.0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 5.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.6\n|Nov precipitation days = 10.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.7\n|year precipitation days = 88.6\n|Jan humidity = 66.3\n|Feb humidity = 69.5\n|Mar humidity = 72.6\n|Apr humidity = 72.3\n|May humidity = 71.4\n|Jun humidity = 70.1\n|Jul humidity = 65.5\n|Aug humidity = 58.0\n|Sep humidity = 55.9\n|Oct humidity = 58.0\n|Nov humidity = 60.3\n|Dec humidity = 63.6\n|year humidity = 65.3\n|Jan sun = 257.3\n|Feb sun = 229.6\n|Mar sun = 204.6\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 170.5\n|Aug sun = 204.6\n|Sep sun = 213.0\n|Oct sun = 238.7\n|Nov sun = 255.0\n|Dec sun = 251.1\n|year sun = 2533.9\n|Jan percentsun = 60\n|Feb percentsun = 62\n|Mar percentsun = 54\n|Apr percentsun = 55\n|May percentsun = 52\n|Jun percentsun = 49\n|Jul percentsun = 53\n|Aug percentsun = 60\n|Sep percentsun = 60\n|Oct percentsun = 60\n|Nov percentsun = 62\n|Dec percentsun = 57\n|year percentsun = 57\n|source 1 = [[Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (Argentina)|Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional]]<ref name = SMNclimatenormals>{{cite web\n| url = https://ssl.smn.gob.ar/dpd/observaciones/estadisticas.txt\n| title = Estad\u00edsticas Climatol\u00f3gicas Normales - per\u00edodo 1981-2010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=SMNextremes>\n{{cite web\n |url          = https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |title        = Clima en la Argentina: Guia Clim\u00e1tica por C\u00f3rdoba Obs.\n |work         = Caracterizaci\u00f3n: Estad\u00edsticas de largo plazo\n |publisher    = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language     = Spanish\n |accessdate   = 5 October 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904022616/https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |archive-date = 4 September 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/AG/87345.TXT\n| title = CORDOBA OBS Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Ingeniero Aeron\u00e1utico Ambrosio L.V.

The district is home to the Bank of C\u00f3rdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Mart\u00edn Square, the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of C\u00f3rdoba|Jesuit Block]] (declared UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]) and the Genaro P\u00e9rez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Col\u00f3n, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is the San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.\n\nDowntown C\u00f3rdoba is home of large shopping malls, notably [[Patio Olmos]]. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the [[French architecture|French architect]], [[Ernest Sanson]]. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum|Evita Per\u00f3n Museum of Fine Arts]] (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.\n\n[[New C\u00f3rdoba]] has a number of important avenues such as ''Yrigoyen'' and ''V\u00e9lez Sarsfield''. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.\n\n[[File:Puente parque de las tejas.JPG|thumb|Tejas Park at New C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nCiudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} [[Sarmiento Park]], the city's most important one. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in [[Argentina]], founded by Jesuits around 1622. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] is also famous for the \"Reforma Universitaria\", a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt lead to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from C\u00f3rdoba to [[Lima]] (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the [[National Technological University|UTN]], dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There are also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The ''C\u00f3rdoba Zoo'' is located in this district.\n\nLocated about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from downtown C\u00f3rdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood's economic activity centers around the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as \"Las Delicias\" and \"Lomas de los Carolinos\", are in the old Camino a La Calera.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe C\u00f3rdoba public transport system includes [[rail transport|trains]], [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[taxi]]s. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.\n\nThe city is served by the nation's third largest airport [[Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport]].\n\n=== Buses ===\nBuses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around C\u00f3rdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina.

It has about 105,000 students, and offers degrees in a wide variety of subjects in the sciences, applied sciences, social sciences, humanities and arts.\n\nThe [[National Technological University \u2013 C\u00f3rdoba Regional Faculty|C\u00f3rdoba Regional Faculty]] is a branch of the [[National Technological University]] in C\u00f3rdoba, offering undergraduate degrees in engineering (civil, electrical, electronic, industrial, mechanical, metallurgy, chemical and information), as well as master's degrees in engineering and business, and a PhD program in engineering and materials.\n\nThe [[Catholic University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest [[private university]] in C\u00f3rdoba, it has nearly 10,000 students.\n\nThe Aeronautic University Institute, run by the Argentine Air Force, offers degrees in aeronautical, telecommunications and electronic engineering, as well as information systems, accounting, logistics and administration.\n\nThe [[Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico C\u00f3rdoba]] was created jointly by the six universities located in the city to support technological development in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Montero |first1=Sergio |last2=Chapple |first2=Karen |year=2018 |title=Fragile Governance and Local Economic Development: Theory and Evidence from Peripheral Regions in Latin America |publisher=Routledge |page=131 |isbn=9781351589437}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the Universidad Siglo 21 and Universidad Blas Pascal are private universities in the city.\n\nThe Air Force Academy and the Air Force NCOs School are both located in the city outskirts.\n\nThere is an Italian international school, [[Escuela Dante Alighieri]].\n\nThe area once had a German school, Deutsche Schule Cordoba.<ref>\"[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/04/036/0403672.pdf Deutscher Bundestag 4.

Retrieved on 12 March 2016. p. 18/51.</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Literature ===\nThe Literary activity flourished in the city at the beginning of the last century. C\u00f3rdoba was the city of [[Leopoldo Lugones]], Arturo Capdevila and Marcos Aguinis, among many other prestigious writers. Among the city's best-known museums are the [[Caraffa Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 1916, and the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 2007. The [[Paseo del Buen Pastor]], a cultural center opened in 2007, features an art museum, as well as a shopping gallery devoted to local vintners, cheese makers, leather crafters and other artisans.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe typical music in C\u00f3rdoba is the ''[[cuarteto]]'', heard in many parties and pubs. Among the most popular cuarteto singers are [[La Mona Jim\u00e9nez|Carlos ''La Mona'' Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]], La Barra and Jean Carlos. The places they usually sing are named ''bailes'' (dances). One of the first groups was ''Cuarteto de Oro''.\n\nOther music styles popular with the youth are [[electronic music]] (or ''electro''), as well as [[reggaeton]]. These are commonly played at ''boliches'', as night clubs are known in Argentina. C\u00f3rdoba is sometimes referred to as \"the nightlife city\" (or \"the city that never sleeps\"), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage ''matin\u00e9es'' (dancing clubs).\n\nC\u00f3rdoba's rich musical culture also encompasses [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], rock and pop, in a variety of venues.\n\n[[Libertador Theatre|Teatro Libertador San Mart\u00edn]] regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:La Ca\u00f1ada de C\u00f3rdoba 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|[[Ca\u00f1ada of C\u00f3rdoba|La Ca\u00f1ada]] (an embanked stream), perhaps the most emblematic structure in C\u00f3rdoba.]]\n[[File:Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|The Cathedral]] appeared as a project in the first map of C\u00f3rdoba in 1577.]]\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era. In the centre, near the ''Plaza San Mart\u00edn'' square, is the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral|Cathedral]], whose altar is made of stone and silver from [[Potos\u00ed]]. Every ornament inside is made of gold and the roof is all painted with different images from the Bible. Another important historic building is the ''[[C\u00f3rdoba Cabildo|Cabildo]]'' (colonial government house), located next to the church. The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe first festival of the year is in February, the ''[[Carnival]]'', where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.\n\nThen in the middle of the year, on 20 July, ''Friends Day'' is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at ''Parque de las Naciones'' or ''Parque Sarmiento'' and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe last festival is ''Spring Day'', held on 21 September, which is Students' Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]]. There they can enjoy lots of activities like concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arco de C\u00f3rdoba 2007-11-16.jpg|The C\u00f3rdoba Gateway\nFile:Parque Sarmiento, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 1.jpg|[[Sarmiento Park]]\nFile:Av.

Mitchell said, \"It\u2019s the wrong thing for a leader to say,\" and he told the leader, \"It\u2019s politically damaging to the party, to the country.\" A few days later, while Mitchell waited to go on to a prime-time T.V. network appearance, he saw a clip of Trump rally attendees chanting, \"send her back,\" aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. [[Ilhan Omar]] (D-Minn.). Mitchell asked an aide: \"How do I even respond to this on TV?\" For Mitchell, the final straw was the refusal of Trump staffers to listen. Mitchell begged Vice President [[Mike Pence]], and the Vice President's Chief of Staff, Marc Short, to arrange a one-on-one conversation between Mitchell and Trump to address his misgivings.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-takeover-of-gop-forces-many-house-republicans-to-head-for-the-exits/2019/09/22/d89f99fc-d4bd-11e9-ab26-e6dbebac45d3_story.html], ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 22, 2019.

The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]], about one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life.

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host.

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

[[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\".

Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]].

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; [[RNA virus]]es: Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; [[Reverse transcribing viruses]]: These have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. [[Retrovirus]]es integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

Peabody, having become a wealthy man in Baltimore through commerce during the 1810s and 20s, following his brief service in the state militia defending the city against the famous British attack during the [[War of 1812]], \"gave $300,000 as a beginning sum for the Peabody Institute\" in February 1857.<ref>Franklin Parker.George Peabody and Maryland. Peabody Journal of Education, Vol. 37, No. 3. (Nov., 1959), pp. 150-157.</ref>  The Institute was originally planned to open in 1860, but border-state conflict in the region caused by the [[American Civil War]] delayed its establishing and construction until 1866, when Peabody dedicated the first segment West Wing of the new Peabody Institute to the citizens of Baltimore in appreciation of their kindness and hospitality. The Institute was designed to be a cultural center for the City of Baltimore, with plans for an art gallery, music school, a public lecture series, a series of cash awards with gold medals known as \"Peabody Prizes\" for the top graduates of the city's then-three public high schools (one  of boys at Central High\u2014now [[Baltimore City College]]\u2014and two for girls at [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern]] and [[Western High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Western High Schools]]), as well as a public, non-circulating reference library which was later moved to the second attached segment  in the East Wing in 1876-1878.<ref>Dorsey, John.  Mr. Peabody's Library.  Baltimore, 1978. 4-5</ref>  This original [[Peabody Institute]] west wing opened in 1866 as Mr. Peabody, then a long-time resident of first [[New York City]], then [[London, England]], was greeted by the gathered thousands of Baltimore City Public School children as he stood on the steps of his landmark building overlooking the circle at the [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]] in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood and the current library structure in the east wing was designed in the same identical style by the famed local architect [[Edmund George Lind|Edmund G. Lind]] which opened to the public in 1878.  The library remained part of the Peabody Institute until 1967, when it was transferred to the City of Baltimore and became a department in the nearby [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] on Cathedral Street, the City and State's free public library system (oldest in America), which had been founded and endowed in 1882-1886 by George Peabody's friend and fellow Bay Stater, [[Enoch Pratt]], (1808\u20131896).
