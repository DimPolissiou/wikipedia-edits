The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Northern Canaanites (Phoenicians) were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon have their own additional 4 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types of Dabke include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n'''1.Dabket Arab''' is a slower and more sophisticated Dabke variation native to Akkar, Beqaa Valley and Bordering villages between Lebanon and Syria it's typically accompanied by a Mijwiz(double Reed instrument) and a tabel(Lebanese drum) and a Minjeira or Mizmar(types of flutes). \n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''2.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''3.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats.

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Northern Canaanites (Phoenicians) were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon have their own additional 4 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types of Dabke include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n'''1.Dabket Arab''' is a slower and more sophisticated Dabke variation native to Akkar, Beqaa Valley and Bordering villages between Lebanon and Syria it's typically accompanied by a Mijwiz(double Reed instrument) and a tabel(Lebanese drum) and a Minjeira or Mizmar(types of flutes). \n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''2.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''3.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''4.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000. In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), World Music, Vol. 1: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, pp 391\u2013395. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

The title [[allusion|alludes]] to one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's paradoxes of motion]], in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an [[infinite regression]].\n\n==Summary of the dialogue==\nThe discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\" ([[Euclidean relation]], a weakened form of the [[transitive property]])\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nThe Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of [[Euclid]] who grants that the argument is ''logically valid'', as a ''sequence'', while denying that ''A'' and ''B'' are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true, while not yet accepting that ''A'' and ''B'' are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).\n\nThe Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that ''A'' and ''B'' are true, but who does ''not'' yet accept the principle that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that ''Z'' must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the [[syllogism]]'s conclusion, structure, or validity.)\n\nAfter writing down ''A'', ''B'', and ''Z'' in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise agrees to accept ''C'', if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nBut now that the Tortoise accepts premise ''C'', it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that \"If you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'', you must accept ''Z'',\" the Tortoise remarks that that's ''another'' hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts ''C'', it could still fail to conclude ''Z'' if it did not see the truth of:\n* ''D'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, ''Z'' must be true:\n{{quote|\"And at last we've got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', ''of course'' you accept ''Z''.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said the Tortoise innocently. \"Let's make that quite clear. I accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D''. Suppose I ''still'' refused to accept ''Z''?\"\n\n\"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and ''force'' you to do it!\" Achilles triumphantly replied. \"Logic would tell you, 'You can't help yourself. Now that you've accepted ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', you must accept ''Z''!' So you've no choice, you see.\"\n\n\"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down'',\" said the Tortoise. \"So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it\n{{block indent|(''E'') If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'' are true, ''Z'' must be true.}}\n\nUntil I've granted that, of course I needn't grant ''Z''. So it's quite a necessary step, you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}\n\nThus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:\n* (1): \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* (2): \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* (3): (1) and (2) \u21d2 (Z)\n* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) \u21d2 (Z)\n* ...\n* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' \u2212 1) \u21d2 (''Z'')\n* Therefore, (''Z''): \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nAt each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.\n\n==Explanation==\nLewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. \n:<math>\\frac{P \\to Q,\\; P}{\\therefore Q}</math>\nOr, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.\n\nThe regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined within the system, then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system. In analogy, chess is played according to a particular set of rules, and when a person plays chess, he cannot question or beg to differ from the given rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. That is not to say that the chess player agrees with these rules (consider for example, rule changes such as ''[[en passant]]''). Likewise, a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system, and when a person reasons according to this formal system, he cannot question or differ from these inference rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system. That is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules (consider for example, the constructivist's rejection of the [[Law of the Excluded Middle]] and the dialethist's rejection of the [[Law of noncontradiction]]). In this way, formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress: ''modus ponens'' is placed as a rule within the system, the validity of ''modus ponens'' is eschewed to without the system.\n\nIn propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:\n\nP implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].\n\nHence de modo ponente, [P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)] \u21d2 Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.\n\nIn addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.\n\nSome logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.\n\n==Discussion==\nSeveral philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 \u00a7 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form \"if ''p'', then ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form \"''p'', therefore ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true.\"\n\nThe [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that \"the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something\" (p.&nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that \"a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts\" (p.&nbsp;53).\n\nCarroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,<ref name=\"Maddy\">{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481\u2013504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}</ref> later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

Now in its fifth generation, the successor to the [[Audi 100]] is manufactured in [[Neckarsulm]], Germany, and is available in saloon and [[Station wagon|estate]] configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the ''Avant''. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7 and the C8. The related [[Audi A7]] is essentially a sportback (fastback) version of the C7-series and C8-series A6, but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.\n\nAll generations of the A6 have offered either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[Torsen]]-based [[four-wheel drive]], marketed by Audi as their [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|''quattro'']] system. Second- and third-generation A6 models have shared their [[Automobile platform|platform]] with the company's [[Audi A6 allroad quattro|Allroad]] models.\n\nBoth petrol and diesel versions of the A6 are offered. The wide range of engines available have power outputs ranging from {{convert|150 to 333|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. These are [[inline 4]]-cylinder 16-valve [[turbocharged]] engines and more powerful 3-litre units in a V6 configuration with a mechanical compressor.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== C4 (''Typ'' 4A, 1994\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (C4/4A)\n| image = File:Audi-A6-C4.jpg\n| production = {{Unbulleted list |1994\u20131997 (Germany) |2000\u20132003 (China)}}\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C4|Volkswagen Group C4]]\n| engine = 1.8&nbsp;[[litre|L]] [[inline-four engine|I4]]<br>2.0&nbsp;L I4<br>2.2&nbsp;L [[inline-four engine|I5]] Turbo<br>2.3&nbsp;L I5<br>2.6&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]]<br>2.8&nbsp;L V6<br>4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>1.9&nbsp;L I4 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]<br>2.5&nbsp;L [[straight-five engine|I5]] TDI\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>6-speed manual<br>4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2687|mm|1|abbr=on}} (FWD)<br>{{convert|2692|mm|1|abbr=on}} (AWD)\n| length = {{convert|4797|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1783|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| assembly = {{Unbulleted list |Germany: [[Neckarsulm]] |China: [[Changchun]] ([[FAW-VW]])<ref name=\"Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog\">{{cite web|author=Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog |url=http://www.germancarblog.com/2006/08/audi-new-sales-division-in-china.html |title=Audi: New sales division in China |publisher=The German Car Blog |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref>}}\n| related = [[Audi 100]] (1990\u20131994)<br>[[Audi S4]] (UrS4) (1991\u20131994)<br>[[Audi S6]] (UrS6) (1994\u20131997, a renamed Audi S4)\n| designer = Hartmut Warkuss (1992)\n| sp = uk\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Audi A6 C4 jaslo.JPG\n| caption1 = Sedan\n| image2 = Audi A6 2.8 wagon.jpg\n| caption2 = Avant \n}}\n\n[[Audi]]'s [[executive car]] was previously named the [[Audi 100]] (or Audi 5000 in the United States), and was released in three successive generations ([[Audi 100#C1|Audi C1]], [[Audi 100#C2|Audi C2]] and [[Audi 100#C3|Audi C3]]).<ref name=\"carautoportal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-a6.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025174124/http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-a6.php|url-status = dead|archive-date=2009-10-25|title=Audi A6 Reference|accessdate=2009-06-22|work=CarAutoPortal.com}}</ref> In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the [[Audi 100#C4|Audi 100]] received a facelift and was renamed as the '''Audi A6''', to fit in with Audi's new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size [[Audi A8|A8]] had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the \"C4\" Audi 100 \u2013 new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of RHD Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe.\n\nThe new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]], 2.0-litre 8v [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]], 2.6-litre 12V [[V6 engine|V6]] and 2.8-litre 30v [[V6 engine|V6]] petrol engines, with the 2.3-litre [[straight-five engine|inline five engine]] being dropped on most markets. For the [[diesel engine]]s, an inline four 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI), and the inline five (R5) 2.5 TDI ({{convert|103|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}) were available.\n\nUntil 1997, the A6 came with several different engines, two of them [[turbodiesel]], and most of them available with Audi's [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.

As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the ''[[Audi Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|Ur-S6]]'', derived from the German augmentive, \"'''Ur'''spr\u00fcnglich\" (meaning: original). It was available as both a [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] (''typ'' 4A5), and an \"Avant\" (''typ'' 4A9) ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia.\n\nFrom its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a {{convert|2226|cc|1}} [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-five engine|inline five-cylinder]] petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] electronic [[engine control unit]] (ECU), producing a motive power output of {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,900 rpm and {{convert|326|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at around 1,950&nbsp;rpm, on high [[octane rating|octane]] \"Super Plus\" 98RON unleaded petrol. This engine gave the S6 a top speed of {{convert|235|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, and allowed it to accelerate from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 6.7&nbsp;seconds; with {{convert|160|km/h|1|abbr=on}} being reached in 17.5&nbsp;seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed [[manual transmission]] (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic [[Torsen]] T-1 [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.\n\nAudi made a high-performance, 4.2-litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a {{convert|213|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder turbo. Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive. A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.\n\n===Audi S6 PLUS{{anchor|S6+}}===\n[[File:Audi S6 Plus Limousine.jpg|thumb|right|Audi S6 Plus]]\nAs a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production '''Audi S6 PLUS''' was briefly available to European customers. The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, '''[[quattro GmbH]]''', was available for sale during the 1997 [[model year]] only (production from June 1996 to October 1997). A total of 952 cars were produced\u2013855 Avants, and 97 saloons.\n\nIt was powered by another version of the 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2-litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the [[Audi S8]] as AKH). Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the engine, increasing the maximum power to {{convert|240|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. It was only available with a revised six-speed [[manual transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) ([[gear ratio]]s \u2013 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.\n\nFurther revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and wheels.  The front [[disc brake|brake discs]] were enlarged to {{convert|323|mm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick. Standard wheels were 8Jx17 \"Avus\" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.\n\nWith so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} from a standstill in 5.6&nbsp;seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7&nbsp;seconds.\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C5}}\n\n== C5 (''Typ'' 4B, 1997\u20132004) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (C5/4B)\n| image = Audi A6 C5 front 20081009.jpg\n| production = May 1997 \u2013 June 2004 (Germany)<br/>2003\u20132006 (China; [[FAW-Volkswagen|FAW-VW]])\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5]]\n| engine = {{Unbulleted list | '''petrol''' | 1.8&nbsp;L 20v [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8 L Turbocharged 20v I4 | 2.0 L 20v I4 | 2.4 L 30v [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.4 L 30v BDV [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.7 L [[Turbocharger|turbo]] 30v V6 | 2.8 L 30v V6 | 3.0 L 30v V6 | 4.2 L 40v V8 | 4.2 L turbo 40v [[V8 engine|V8]] | '''[[Diesel engine|diesel]]''' | 1.9&nbsp;L TDI I4 | 2.5&nbsp;L 24v TDI V6 }}\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>6-speed manual<br>5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>[[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]]<br>5-speed automatic with tiptronic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2760|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4796|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autodata.bg/mod/id:928|title=AutoData.bg \u2013 Audi A6 A6 (4B, C5) 1.8 (125 Hp)|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n| height = saloon: {{convert|1453|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br>Avant: {{convert|1479|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1480|kg|1|abbr=on|lk=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auto-data.net/en/?f=showCar&car_id=4700|title=Audi \u2013 A6 (4B, C5) \u2013 2.4 (170 Hp) \u2013 Technical specifications, Fuel economy (consumption)|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n| assembly = {{Unbulleted list |Germany: [[Neckarsulm]] |China: [[Changchun]] ([[FAW-VW]])<ref name=\"Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog\"/>}}\n| related = [[Audi S6]] (''Typ'' 4B, 2001\u20132003)<br>[[Audi RS6]] (''Typ'' 4B, 2002\u20132004)\n| designer = Claus Potthoff (1992, 1994)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kable|first1=Greg|title=A6 OPINIONS 'ENCOURAGING'|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19970331/ANE/703310864/a6-opinions-encouraging|website=Automotive News Europe|publisher=Crain Communications Incorporated|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><br/>Hartmut Warkuss (1994)\n| sp = uk\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left| direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1998 Audi A6 (4B) 2.8 quattro sedan (2015-07-03).jpg\n| caption1 = Sedan\n| image2 = Audi A6 Avant 2.8.jpg\n| caption2 = Avant\n| image3 = Dashboard 2004 Audi 2.5 TDI Quattro Avant.JPG\n| caption3 = Interior\n| image4 = Under the hood of a 2004 Audi 2.5 TDI Quattro Avant.JPG\n| caption4 = Engine\n}}\n\nIn February 1997, the introduction of a new A6 ('''''Typ'' 4B'''), based on a new design [[automobile platform]] \u2013 the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5 platform]], with a new range of engines was announced and appeared in March at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1997|1997 Geneva Motor Show]]. This new A6 moved up a notch in quality, and was marketed in the same categories as the [[BMW 5 Series]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]]. The redesigned body presented a modern design, with a fastback styling which set the trend for the Audi lineup, and gave the relatively large [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] an [[aerodynamic]] shell with a low [[coefficient of drag]] of 0.28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/geneva_97/g97vw.html#audi|title=The 67th Annual Geneva Car Show \u2013 1997|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, the \"C5\" A6 was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's ''Ten Best'' list. This new A6 was available with a wide range of engines and configurations. The 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre [[V6 engine]]s represented the bulk of the A6's development programme, with a multitude of other engine configurations available throughout the globe. As an alternative to the [[manual transmission]], a five-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] was also available.\n\nThe C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/audi/a6/1999/expert-reviews/?review=2&reviewId=35454|title=1999 Audi A6|author=Anita And Paul Lienert|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715022929/http://www.cars.com/audi/a6/1999/expert-reviews/?review=2&reviewId=35454|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi's name for an [[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) available at all in 1998 \u2013 Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 [[model year]], and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with [[FMVSS]], the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received [[daytime running lamp|daytime running lights]] as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre [[twin-turbo|\"biturbo\"]] V6 (also found in the [[Audi S4#B5|B5 platform S4]], {{convert|250|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve [[V8 engine|V8]] [[petrol engine]] ({{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}); the two higher-spec. engines were only offered with [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]]. The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamps and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger wheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brakes and [[Torsen]]-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive as standard.\n\nIn 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body moldings, and tail light colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with {{convert|96|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The 1.9-litre [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum power output of {{convert|96|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|310|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and was mated to a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]]. The 2.4-litre V6 was named the BDV 30 valves and  gained an extra 5&nbsp;hp and better balancing , and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with {{convert|162|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in {{convert|184|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, controlled by standard quattro system. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in {{convert|120|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} (after the second modification) and {{convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with {{convert|132|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|370|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged.\n\nAlso new was the [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]], available in most [[front-wheel drive]] models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi's trademark four-wheel-drive system, quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling was sold as the [[Audi allroad quattro]], Audi's first [[crossover SUV]].\n\nThe second-generation A6 was on ''Car and Driver'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the ''[[World Car of the Year]]'' award for 2005. In addition, the facelifted third-generation A6 3.0T won two ''Car and Driver'' \"comparos\" that pitted it against other sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF, and Infiniti M.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Crash testing\n|-\n|[[EuroNCAP]] adult occupant:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a6_1998/48.aspx|title=For safer cars &#124; Audi A6|publisher=Euro NCAP|date= |accessdate=2009-05-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415112452/http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a6_1998/48.aspx| archivedate= 15 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>\n|{{rating|3|5}}\n|-\n|[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] overall frontal offset crash test:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=129|title=IIHS-HLDI: Audi A6|publisher=Iihs.org|date=2006-03-29|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n|Acceptable\n|}\n\n=== S6 and RS6 ===\n{{Main|Audi S6}}\n\nThe [[Audi S6#C5|Audi S6]] was a high-powered variant of the A6, featuring a modified version of the 4.2-litre [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|250|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.

Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced [[suspension (vehicle)|air suspension]] system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger wheels with all-terrain tyres, and flared and unpainted bumpers, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. As the name \"allroad quattro\" suggests, Audi's [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system was standard equipment for all versions.\n\nThe standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide {{convert|208|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official [[Land Rover]] test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only {{convert|142|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.\n\nAudi's 2.7-litre, [[turbocharger|twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine|V6]] [[petrol engine]] with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with {{convert|132|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|370|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine, was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163&nbsp;bhp) followed in 2004.\n\nAudi stopped production of the allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America.\n\nWith the return of the \"allroad\" nameplate to North America, in the form of the 2013 A4 allroad quattro, the C5-Platform allroad quattro has begun to take the name \"Ur-allroad.\" The '[[wikt:ur-|Ur-]]' is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify 'ancient' or 'early ancestor' (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgro\u00dfmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the ''original''<ref name=\"carautoportal-ur\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-urs4-s6.php|title=Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|accessdate=2009-07-09|work=carautoportal.com|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025174236/http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-urs4-s6.php|archivedate=2009-10-25|df=}}</ref> [[Audi Quattro]] that was produced from 1980 \u2013 1991 (the \"Ur-Quattro\").

Designed by Satoshi Wada in 2001, this model is visually an evolution of the C5, but was lengthened to {{convert|4927|mm|1|abbr=on}}, and has the new Audi \"single-frame grille\". Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 has a \"tornado line\" that runs from the front lights to the rear lights just below the body shoulders.<ref>{{cite web|url=\thttp://www.autoblog.com/buy/2009-Audi-A6/expert-review/ |title=2009 Audi A6 |publisher=Autoblog.com}}</ref>\n\nThe C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as [[height adjustable suspension|suspension configuration]] and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls which operate multiple devices using the integrated display.\n\nOn the engines, the new [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]] continues as an alternative for [[front-wheel drive]] models, alongside a new six-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] available in the [[four-wheel drive]] models. Audi's \"trademark\" [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent four-wheel drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. quattro is ''not'' available on the multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and tiptronic gear systems. Conversely the tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre [[V6 engine]], but not for the North American market.\n\nThe Avant was previewed by the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept in 2001 and arrived during the course of 2005. The A6 allroad quattro made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] [[diesel engine]]s, or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 [[petrol engine]].\n\n===A6L (2005\u20132009)===\nThis is a long [[wheelbase]] version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 at the [[Shanghai motor show|Shanghai Motor Show]].\n\nThe vehicles went on sale in the middle of 2005. Early models include A6L 2.4, with A6L 2.0 [[Turbo fuel stratified injection|TFSI]] (170 PS) followed shortly after. A6L 3.0 quattro (218 PS) and A6L 4.2 quattro (335 PS) were introduced in 2005. Other models include A6 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiworld.com/news/05/chinaa6/content.shtml|title=New Audi A6 presented as a Long-Wheelbase version exclusively for China|date=2005-03-08|work=AudiWorld.com|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>\n\n===S6===\n{{Main|Audi S6}}\n\nThe [[Audi S6#C6|Audi S6]] performance variant was introduced in the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], and produced from early 2006 until 2011.

M\u00e4rz 2011, W\u00fclfrath.jpg|thumb|right|Facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TFSI]]\n\nAudi announced the C6 series allroad in the spring of 2005 and released it in the summer of 2006. This model was called the '''Audi A6 allroad quattro''' (unlike the previous version, which was merely called ''Audi allroad quattro'', with no reference to the A6 nomenclature).\n\nThe Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[petrol engine]]s, a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]]s, a 180&nbsp;PS (132&nbsp;kW) 2.7&nbsp;L and a 225&nbsp;PS (233 only in the US) (162&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L. The [[tiptronic]] gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI.\n\nThe 6-speed tiptronic transmission system converted high-torque engine power into both sporty performance and operating convenience, with crisp, fast gear changes. Advanced electronics respond efficiently to all driver input in both D (Drive) and S (Sport) programmes, helping to prevent unwanted upshifts when cornering. The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60&nbsp;mm (2.36&nbsp;in) to provide [[ground clearance]] of 185&nbsp;mm (7.28&nbsp;in) which is better than the older four-mode.\n\nThe car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills.\n\nIn some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger [[Audi Q7]], but air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7.

Sales began in 2012. The first UK deliveries arrived in July 2012.\n\nThe allroad variant contains several unique features. Audi designed more than 1,100 new, unique parts for the allroad, setting it apart from the standard A6 and making it a true all-terrain vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Most obvious, the allroad received special bumpers and fender flares, giving it an aggressive offroad appearance. The bumpers and fender flares feature a tough-wearing, matte finish, contrasting the rest of the body. The roof received this same coating, as well as four longitudinal ribs for increased strength. The unique bumpers also have integrated aluminum skid plates. The allroad featured larger diameter tires than the standard A6 for improved offroad capabilities. Redesigned headlights, larger side mirrors, and a lack of door \"rub strips\" are unique to the allroad.\n\t\nThe allroad comes standard with an [[Height adjustable suspension|adjustable]] [[air suspension]] system can lift the car high enough to provide {{convert|208|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official [[Land Rover]] test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nConversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only {{convert|142|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.\n\nIt went on sale in spring 2012. Early variants included 3.0 TFSI quattro (310 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (204 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (245 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (313 PS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/news/models_and_services.detail.2012~01~the_new_audi_a6_allroad.html|title=The new Audi A6 allroad \u2013 the Avant for any kind of road|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/11/audi-releases-new-a6-allroad-with-no-word-on-u-s-availabilit/|title=Audi releases new A6 Allroad... with no word on U.S. availability|author=Noah Joseph|work=Autoblog|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===A6 L (2012\u20132018)===\nThe A6 L (built in China for the Chinese market as a long wheelbase alternative to the standard A6) was unveiled in 2012 in [[Guangzhou International Sports Arena]].

Michael Wines of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"More than a perk, the black Audi is a rolling advertisement for its occupant\u2019s importance and impunity in a nation obsessed with status.\"<ref>Wines, Michael. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/fashion/in-china-audi-means-big-shot.html?_r=0 In China, \u2018Audi\u2019 Means \u2018Big Shot\u2019].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Now in its fifth generation, the successor to the [[Audi 100]] is manufactured in [[Neckarsulm]], Germany, and is available in saloon and [[Station wagon|estate]] configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the ''Avant''. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7 and the C8. The related [[Audi A7]] is essentially a sportback (fastback) version of the C7-series and C8-series A6, but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.\n\nAll generations of the A6 have offered either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[Torsen]]-based [[four-wheel drive]], marketed by Audi as their [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|''quattro'']] system. Second- and third-generation A6 models have shared their [[Automobile platform|platform]] with the company's [[Audi A6 allroad quattro|Allroad]] models.\n\nBoth petrol and diesel versions of the A6 are offered. The wide range of engines available have power outputs ranging from {{convert|150 to 333|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. These are [[inline 4]]-cylinder 16-valve [[turbocharged]] engines and more powerful 3-litre units in a V6 configuration with a mechanical compressor.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== C4 (''Typ'' 4A, 1994\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (C4/4A)\n| image = File:Audi-A6-C4.jpg\n| production = {{Unbulleted list |1994\u20131997 (Germany) |2000\u20132003 (China)}}\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C4|Volkswagen Group C4]]\n| engine = 1.8&nbsp;[[litre|L]] [[inline-four engine|I4]]<br>2.0&nbsp;L I4<br>2.2&nbsp;L [[inline-four engine|I5]] Turbo<br>2.3&nbsp;L I5<br>2.6&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]]<br>2.8&nbsp;L V6<br>4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>1.9&nbsp;L I4 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]<br>2.5&nbsp;L [[straight-five engine|I5]] TDI\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>6-speed manual<br>4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2687|mm|1|abbr=on}} (FWD)<br>{{convert|2692|mm|1|abbr=on}} (AWD)\n| length = {{convert|4797|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1783|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| assembly = {{Unbulleted list |Germany: [[Neckarsulm]] |China: [[Changchun]] ([[FAW-VW]])<ref name=\"Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog\">{{cite web|author=Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog |url=http://www.germancarblog.com/2006/08/audi-new-sales-division-in-china.html |title=Audi: New sales division in China |publisher=The German Car Blog |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref>}}\n| related = [[Audi 100]] (1990\u20131994)<br>[[Audi S4]] (UrS4) (1991\u20131994)<br>[[Audi S6]] (UrS6) (1994\u20131997, a renamed Audi S4)\n| designer = Hartmut Warkuss (1992)\n| sp = uk\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Audi A6 C4 jaslo.JPG\n| caption1 = Sedan\n| image2 = Audi A6 2.8 wagon.jpg\n| caption2 = Avant \n}}\n\n[[Audi]]'s [[executive car]] was previously named the [[Audi 100]] (or Audi 5000 in the United States), and was released in three successive generations ([[Audi 100#C1|Audi C1]], [[Audi 100#C2|Audi C2]] and [[Audi 100#C3|Audi C3]]).<ref name=\"carautoportal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-a6.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025174124/http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-a6.php|url-status = dead|archive-date=2009-10-25|title=Audi A6 Reference|accessdate=2009-06-22|work=CarAutoPortal.com}}</ref> In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the [[Audi 100#C4|Audi 100]] received a facelift and was renamed as the '''Audi A6''', to fit in with Audi's new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size [[Audi A8|A8]] had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the \"C4\" Audi 100 \u2013 new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of RHD Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe.\n\nThe new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]], 2.0-litre 8v [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]], 2.6-litre 12V [[V6 engine|V6]] and 2.8-litre 30v [[V6 engine|V6]] petrol engines, with the 2.3-litre [[straight-five engine|inline five engine]] being dropped on most markets. For the [[diesel engine]]s, an inline four 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI), and the inline five (R5) 2.5 TDI ({{convert|103|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}) were available.\n\nUntil 1997, the A6 came with several different engines, two of them [[turbodiesel]], and most of them available with Audi's [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.

As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the ''[[Audi Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|Ur-S6]]'', derived from the German augmentive, \"'''Ur'''spr\u00fcnglich\" (meaning: original). It was available as both a [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] (''typ'' 4A5), and an \"Avant\" (''typ'' 4A9) ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia.\n\nFrom its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a {{convert|2226|cc|1}} [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-five engine|inline five-cylinder]] petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] electronic [[engine control unit]] (ECU), producing a motive power output of {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,900 rpm and {{convert|326|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at around 1,950&nbsp;rpm, on high [[octane rating|octane]] \"Super Plus\" 98RON unleaded petrol. This engine gave the S6 a top speed of {{convert|235|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, and allowed it to accelerate from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 6.7&nbsp;seconds; with {{convert|160|km/h|1|abbr=on}} being reached in 17.5&nbsp;seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed [[manual transmission]] (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic [[Torsen]] T-1 [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.\n\nAudi made a high-performance, 4.2-litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a {{convert|213|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder turbo. Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive. A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.\n\n===Audi S6 PLUS{{anchor|S6+}}===\n[[File:Audi S6 Plus Limousine.jpg|thumb|right|Audi S6 Plus]]\nAs a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production '''Audi S6 PLUS''' was briefly available to European customers. The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, '''[[quattro GmbH]]''', was available for sale during the 1997 [[model year]] only (production from June 1996 to October 1997). A total of 952 cars were produced\u2013855 Avants, and 97 saloons.\n\nIt was powered by another version of the 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2-litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the [[Audi S8]] as AKH). Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the engine, increasing the maximum power to {{convert|240|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. It was only available with a revised six-speed [[manual transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) ([[gear ratio]]s \u2013 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.\n\nFurther revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and wheels.  The front [[disc brake|brake discs]] were enlarged to {{convert|323|mm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick. Standard wheels were 8Jx17 \"Avus\" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.\n\nWith so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} from a standstill in 5.6&nbsp;seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7&nbsp;seconds.\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C5}}\n\n== C5 (''Typ'' 4B, 1997\u20132004) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (C5/4B)\n| image = Audi A6 C5 front 20081009.jpg\n| production = May 1997 \u2013 June 2004 (Germany)<br/>2003\u20132006 (China; [[FAW-Volkswagen|FAW-VW]])\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5]]\n| engine = {{Unbulleted list | '''petrol''' | 1.8&nbsp;L 20v [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8 L Turbocharged 20v I4 | 2.0 L 20v I4 | 2.4 L 30v [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.4 L 30v BDV [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.7 L [[Turbocharger|turbo]] 30v V6 | 2.8 L 30v V6 | 3.0 L 30v V6 | 4.2 L 40v V8 | 4.2 L turbo 40v [[V8 engine|V8]] | '''[[Diesel engine|diesel]]''' | 1.9&nbsp;L TDI I4 | 2.5&nbsp;L 24v TDI V6 }}\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>6-speed manual<br>5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>[[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]]<br>5-speed automatic with tiptronic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2760|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4796|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autodata.bg/mod/id:928|title=AutoData.bg \u2013 Audi A6 A6 (4B, C5) 1.8 (125 Hp)|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n| height = saloon: {{convert|1453|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br>Avant: {{convert|1479|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1480|kg|1|abbr=on|lk=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auto-data.net/en/?f=showCar&car_id=4700|title=Audi \u2013 A6 (4B, C5) \u2013 2.4 (170 Hp) \u2013 Technical specifications, Fuel economy (consumption)|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n| assembly = {{Unbulleted list |Germany: [[Neckarsulm]] |China: [[Changchun]] ([[FAW-VW]])<ref name=\"Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog\"/>}}\n| related = [[Audi S6]] (''Typ'' 4B, 2001\u20132003)<br>[[Audi RS6]] (''Typ'' 4B, 2002\u20132004)\n| designer = Claus Potthoff (1992, 1994)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kable|first1=Greg|title=A6 OPINIONS 'ENCOURAGING'|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19970331/ANE/703310864/a6-opinions-encouraging|website=Automotive News Europe|publisher=Crain Communications Incorporated|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><br/>Hartmut Warkuss (1994)\n| sp = uk\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left| direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1998 Audi A6 (4B) 2.8 quattro sedan (2015-07-03).jpg\n| caption1 = Sedan\n| image2 = Audi A6 Avant 2.8.jpg\n| caption2 = Avant\n| image3 = Dashboard 2004 Audi 2.5 TDI Quattro Avant.JPG\n| caption3 = Interior\n| image4 = Under the hood of a 2004 Audi 2.5 TDI Quattro Avant.JPG\n| caption4 = Engine\n}}\n\nIn February 1997, the introduction of a new A6 ('''''Typ'' 4B'''), based on a new design [[automobile platform]] \u2013 the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5 platform]], with a new range of engines was announced and appeared in March at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1997|1997 Geneva Motor Show]]. This new A6 moved up a notch in quality, and was marketed in the same categories as the [[BMW 5 Series]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]].

The 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre [[V6 engine]]s represented the bulk of the A6's development programme, with a multitude of other engine configurations available throughout the globe. As an alternative to the [[manual transmission]], a five-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] was also available.\n\nThe C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/audi/a6/1999/expert-reviews/?review=2&reviewId=35454|title=1999 Audi A6|author=Anita And Paul Lienert|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715022929/http://www.cars.com/audi/a6/1999/expert-reviews/?review=2&reviewId=35454|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi's name for an [[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) available at all in 1998 \u2013 Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 [[model year]], and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with [[FMVSS]], the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received [[daytime running lamp|daytime running lights]] as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre [[twin-turbo|\"biturbo\"]] V6 (also found in the [[Audi S4#B5|B5 platform S4]], {{convert|250|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve [[V8 engine|V8]] [[petrol engine]] ({{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}); the two higher-spec. engines were only offered with [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]]. The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamps and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger wheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brakes and [[Torsen]]-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive as standard.\n\nIn 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body moldings, and tail light colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with {{convert|96|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The 1.9-litre [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum power output of {{convert|96|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|310|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and was mated to a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]]. The 2.4-litre V6 was named the BDV 30 valves and  gained an extra 5&nbsp;hp and better balancing , and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with {{convert|162|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in {{convert|184|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, controlled by standard quattro system. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in {{convert|120|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} (after the second modification) and {{convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with {{convert|132|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|370|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged.\n\nAlso new was the [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]], available in most [[front-wheel drive]] models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi's trademark four-wheel-drive system, quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling was sold as the [[Audi allroad quattro]], Audi's first [[crossover SUV]].\n\nThe second-generation A6 was on ''Car and Driver'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the ''[[World Car of the Year]]'' award for 2005.

Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced [[suspension (vehicle)|air suspension]] system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger wheels with all-terrain tyres, and flared and unpainted bumpers, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. As the name \"allroad quattro\" suggests, Audi's [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system was standard equipment for all versions.\n\nThe standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide {{convert|208|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official [[Land Rover]] test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only {{convert|142|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.\n\nAudi's 2.7-litre, [[turbocharger|twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine|V6]] [[petrol engine]] with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with {{convert|132|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|370|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine, was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163&nbsp;bhp) followed in 2004.\n\nAudi stopped production of the allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America.\n\nWith the return of the \"allroad\" nameplate to North America, in the form of the 2013 A4 allroad quattro, the C5-Platform allroad quattro has begun to take the name \"Ur-allroad.\" The '[[wikt:ur-|Ur-]]' is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify 'ancient' or 'early ancestor' (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgro\u00dfmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the ''original''<ref name=\"carautoportal-ur\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-urs4-s6.php|title=Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|accessdate=2009-07-09|work=carautoportal.com|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025174236/http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-urs4-s6.php|archivedate=2009-10-25|df=}}</ref> [[Audi Quattro]] that was produced from 1980 \u2013 1991 (the \"Ur-Quattro\").

Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 has a \"tornado line\" that runs from the front lights to the rear lights just below the body shoulders.<ref>{{cite web|url=\thttp://www.autoblog.com/buy/2009-Audi-A6/expert-review/ |title=2009 Audi A6 |publisher=Autoblog.com}}</ref>\n\nThe C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as [[height adjustable suspension|suspension configuration]] and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls which operate multiple devices using the integrated display.\n\nOn the engines, the new [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]] continues as an alternative for [[front-wheel drive]] models, alongside a new six-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] available in the [[four-wheel drive]] models. Audi's \"trademark\" [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] permanent four-wheel drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. quattro is ''not'' available on the multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and tiptronic gear systems. Conversely the tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre [[V6 engine]], but not for the North American market.\n\nThe Avant was previewed by the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept in 2001 and arrived during the course of 2005. The A6 allroad quattro made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] [[diesel engine]]s, or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 [[petrol engine]].\n\n===A6L (2005\u20132009)===\nThis is a long [[wheelbase]] version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 at the [[Shanghai motor show|Shanghai Motor Show]].\n\nThe vehicles went on sale in the middle of 2005. Early models include A6L 2.4, with A6L 2.0 [[Turbo fuel stratified injection|TFSI]] (170 PS) followed shortly after. A6L 3.0 quattro (218 PS) and A6L 4.2 quattro (335 PS) were introduced in 2005.

This model was called the '''Audi A6 allroad quattro''' (unlike the previous version, which was merely called ''Audi allroad quattro'', with no reference to the A6 nomenclature).\n\nThe Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[petrol engine]]s, a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]]s, a 180&nbsp;PS (132&nbsp;kW) 2.7&nbsp;L and a 225&nbsp;PS (233 only in the US) (162&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L. The [[tiptronic]] gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI.\n\nThe 6-speed tiptronic transmission system converted high-torque engine power into both sporty performance and operating convenience, with crisp, fast gear changes. Advanced electronics respond efficiently to all driver input in both D (Drive) and S (Sport) programmes, helping to prevent unwanted upshifts when cornering. The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60&nbsp;mm (2.36&nbsp;in) to provide [[ground clearance]] of 185&nbsp;mm (7.28&nbsp;in) which is better than the older four-mode.\n\nThe car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills.\n\nIn some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger [[Audi Q7]], but air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7. In its native country, Germany, it cost a few hundred Euros less than the Q7.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Model!!configuration!!Max. motive power!!Max. torque\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|'''''[[petrol engine]]s'''''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2.0 16v TFSI||[[inline-four engine|Inline 4]] [[DOHC]] turbo||{{convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2.4 24v||[[V6 engine|V6]] DOHC||{{convert|177|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|230|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2.8 24v FSI||V6 DOHC||{{convert|210|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|3.0 30v TFSI||V6 DOHC supercharged||{{convert|290|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|420|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|3.2 24v FSI||V6 DOHC||{{convert|255|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|330|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|4.2 40v||V8 DOHC||{{convert|335|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|420|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|4.2 32v FSI||V8 DOHC||{{convert|350|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|440|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|5.0 40v TFSI ([[Audi RS6#C6|RS6]])||[[V10 engine|V10]] DOHC biturbo||{{convert|580|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|5.2 40v FSI ([[Audi S6#C6|S6]])||V10 DOHC||{{convert|435|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|540|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|'''''[[diesel engine]]s'''''<br>all [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2.0 16v TDI||[[inline-four engine|Inline 4]] [[DOHC]] turbo||{{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} \n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2.7 24v TDI||[[V6 engine|V6]] DOHC turbo||{{convert|163|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|380|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|3.0 24v TDI||V6 DOHC turbo||{{convert|225|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|233|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|240|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|450|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|450|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|500|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Awards===\nIn 2005, the A6 won the ''[[World Car of the Year]]'' award, and has also won the ''Practical Caravan'' \"Towcar of the Year\" awards, due to its array of towing features such as adjustable suspension height and damping, and the presence of a 123 [[towing#Trailer Stability Program or TSP|Trailer Stability Programme]].\n\n=== C6 facelift ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 2009 Audi A6 (4F) 2.0 TFSI sedan 01.jpg\n| image2 = Audi A6 C6 Facelift 20090712 rear.JPG\n| caption2 = Sedan (facelift)\n| image3 = Audi A6 C6 Avant Facelift 20090809 rear.JPG\n| caption3 = Avant (facelift)\n}}\n\nAudi unveiled a [[facelift (automobile)|facelifted]] \"C6\" Audi A6 on 12 August 2008, at the [[Moscow International Automobile Salon|Moscow International Motor Show]].

Sales began in 2012. The first UK deliveries arrived in July 2012.\n\nThe allroad variant contains several unique features. Audi designed more than 1,100 new, unique parts for the allroad, setting it apart from the standard A6 and making it a true all-terrain vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Most obvious, the allroad received special bumpers and fender flares, giving it an aggressive offroad appearance. The bumpers and fender flares feature a tough-wearing, matte finish, contrasting the rest of the body. The roof received this same coating, as well as four longitudinal ribs for increased strength. The unique bumpers also have integrated aluminum skid plates. The allroad featured larger diameter tires than the standard A6 for improved offroad capabilities. Redesigned headlights, larger side mirrors, and a lack of door \"rub strips\" are unique to the allroad.\n\t\nThe allroad comes standard with an [[Height adjustable suspension|adjustable]] [[air suspension]] system can lift the car high enough to provide {{convert|208|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official [[Land Rover]] test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nConversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only {{convert|142|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.\n\nIt went on sale in spring 2012. Early variants included 3.0 TFSI quattro (310 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (204 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (245 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (313 PS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/news/models_and_services.detail.2012~01~the_new_audi_a6_allroad.html|title=The new Audi A6 allroad \u2013 the Avant for any kind of road|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/11/audi-releases-new-a6-allroad-with-no-word-on-u-s-availabilit/|title=Audi releases new A6 Allroad... with no word on U.S. availability|author=Noah Joseph|work=Autoblog|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===A6 L (2012\u20132018)===\nThe A6 L (built in China for the Chinese market as a long wheelbase alternative to the standard A6) was unveiled in 2012 in [[Guangzhou International Sports Arena]].

By 2012 many government officials in China began driving with Audi A6s. After a 1994 campaign from the Chinese government to have officials stop driving Mercedes stretch limousines, the officials began using black Audi A6 cars. Michael Wines of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"More than a perk, the black Audi is a rolling advertisement for its occupant\u2019s importance and impunity in a nation obsessed with status.\"<ref>Wines, Michael. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/fashion/in-china-audi-means-big-shot.html?_r=0 In China, \u2018Audi\u2019 Means \u2018Big Shot\u2019].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Huangshan means ''Yellow Mountain'' in Chinese and the city is named after the famously scenic [[Huangshan|Yellow Mountains]] which cover much of the city's vast geographic expanse.  The prefectural city of Huangshan includes three urban districts and four counties.  The urban center of Huangshan was originally the city of '''Tunxi''', and is now called [[Tunxi District]].  Locals still call the city Tunxi to distinguish urban core from other parts of Huangshan.\n\t\nHuangshan occupies the southernmost part of Anhui. It is bordered by [[Chizhou]] to the northwest, [[Xuancheng]] to the northeast, [[Jiangxi]] Province to the southwest and [[Zhejiang]] Province to the southeast.  Huangshan's history dates back to the time of the [[First Emperor]].  The city's current jurisdiction covers much of the historical and cultural region of [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u5fbd\u5dde}}), which together with [[Anqing]] formed the name of Anhui Province. Huangshan is home to two [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]], [[Mount Huangshan]] and [[Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui - Xidi and Hongcun|Hongcun and Xidi, the ancient villages of southern Anhui]].  It is a leading tourist destination in China.\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Loujiepailou.jpg|thumb|right|An old gate in the city]]\n\nThe [[prefecture-level city]] of Huangshan administers 7 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including 3 [[District of China|districts]] and 4 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].\n\n* [[Tunxi District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5c6f\u6eaa\u533a}})\n* [[Huangshan District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9ec4\u5c71\u533a}})\n* [[Huizhou District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5fbd\u5dde\u533a}})\n* [[She County, Anhui|She County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b59\u53bf}})\n* [[Xiuning County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f11\u5b81\u53bf}})\n* [[Yi County, Anhui|Yi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9edf\u53bf}})\n* [[Qimen County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7941\u95e8\u53bf}})\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Map\n|-\n|<div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Huangshan.png|width=666|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=1390|y=1180|scale=666/2220|text=[[Tunxi District|'''Tunxi''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1070|y=420|scale=666/2220|text=[[Huangshan District|'''Huangshan''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1280|y=900|scale=666/2220|text=[[Huizhou District|'''Huizhou''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1760|y=1000|scale=666/2220|text=[[She County, Anhui|'''She<br/>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1080|y=1260|scale=666/2220|text=[[Xiuning County|'''Xiuning<br/>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=850|y=740|scale=666/2220|text=[[Yi County, Anhui|'''Yi<br/>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=500|y=980|scale=666/2220|text=[[Qimen County|'''Qimen<br/>County''']]}}\n</div>\n|}\n\nThese are further divided into 145 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 42 [[town of China|towns]], 100 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 3 [[subdistrict]]s.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Qimen Hao Ya.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Keemun tea]]\n[[Keemun tea]] is produced in [[Qimen County]], and the tea is named for the county. [[Mao feng]], a green tea, is produced in neighboring counties. Tourism, centered on [[Mount Huang]] and including other scenic and historic sites (such as [[Xidi]] and [[Hongcun]]), is an important part of the Huangshan economy.\n\n==Transportation==\nDue to rugged terrain, Huangshan was traditionally a secluded region.  The Xinan River provided an outlet to the east.  Winding, narrow roads through Huang Mountains made trips to Xuancheng, Wuhu, Guichi and the Yangtze River slow and arduous.  In recent decades, improvements to the transportation infrastructure have made the city and its surrounding tourist attractions more accessible.\n\n===Air===\nThe [[Huangshan Tunxi International Airport]], also referred to as the Tunxi Airport, is located in Tunxi District and is known by the IATA abbreviation '''TXN'''.  The airport was built in 1958 and was expanded in 2000.  It offers daily flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Guangzhou, and weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Shenzhen.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Huangshan train station.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Huangshan Train Station.]]\nHuangshan City is currently served by only one railway line, the [[Anhui\u2013Jiangxi Railway]], which was completed in 1982 and has stations in Jixi County, She County, Tunxi District, Xiuning County, and Qimen County.  From the main Huangshan City Railway Station in Tunxi, direct train service is available to Nanjing, Shanghai, Bengbu, Huaibei, Qingdao and Beijing among other cities the north, and points to the south including Jingdezhen, Yingtan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Kunming.\n\nHuangshan is accessible via high-speed rail through the [[Hefei\u2013Fuzhou high-speed railway]] and the [[Hangzhou\u2013Huangshan intercity railway]].\n\n===Road===\nHuangshan is now a highway junction city.  The Huizhou-Hangzhou Expressway runs east to Hanghzou.  The Hefei-Tongling-Huangshan Expressway heads north to Tongling on the Yangtze River and then to Hefei, the Anhui provincial capital.  The Huangshan-Taling-Taolin Expressway extends southwest to Wuyuan in Jiangxi Province.  The Huangshan-Quzhou-Nanping Expressway, currently under construction, will run southeast through Zhejiang Province to Nanping in Fujian Province.  Until the expressways were built in the first decade of the 21st century, Huangshan's main roads were National Route G205 and Provincial Route S326, which follow the Anhui-Zhejiang Railway.\n\n==Cultural history==\n[[File:Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui \u2013 Xidi and Hongcun-114145.jpg|thumb|Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui \u2013 [[Xidi]] and [[Hongcun]].]]\nIn the Ming dynasty, {{ill|Zheng Zhizhen|zh|\u912d\u4e4b\u73cd}} ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u912d\u4e4b\u73cd}}; 1518&ndash;1595), a native of the [[Huizhou District|Huizhou]], [[Anhui]],  village of [[Qingxi, Anhui|Qingxi]] wrote the opera ''[[Mulian Rescues His Mother]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/xin-ke-chu-xiang-yin-zhu-quan-shan-mulian-jiu-mu-xing-xiao-xi-wen-8-juan/oclc/44465384&referer=brief_results |script-title=zh:\u65b0\u523b\u51fa\u76f8\u97f3\u8a3b\u52f8\u5584\u76ee\u84ee\u6551\u6bcd\u884c\u5b5d\u6232\u6587 : 8\u5377 |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7110/ Mulian Rescues His Mother]  [[World Digital Library]].</ref> According to local legend, Zheng was blind when he wrote the opera and was restored to full sight by a grateful [[Guanyin]] (the legend also has it that when Zheng later wrote a love story he went blind again). {{sfnb|Guo|2005| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJWTY9dIs5oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=according%20local%20legend%20Zhizhen&f=false 89]}}\n\nIn 2011, Local authorities promoted performance of the Ming dynasty play ''Mulian Rescues His Mother'' as a tourist attraction.<ref>[http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/culture/arts/12/8159-1.htm Mulian Opera 'Ghost Drama' Revival] [http://www.womenofchina.cn/ Women of China] March 24, 2011.</ref>\n\n== Other notes ==\nIn early 2008, the BBC broadcast a series of 5 documentaries on life for schoolchildren in China, called \"Chinese School\".

|t={{linktext|\u9ec3\u5c71}} |p={{linktext|Hu\u00e1ngsh\u0101n}}}}), is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southern [[Anhui]] province, People's Republic of China.  Huangshan means ''Yellow Mountain'' in Chinese and the city is named after the famously scenic [[Huangshan|Yellow Mountains]] which cover much of the city's vast geographic expanse.  The prefectural city of Huangshan includes three urban districts and four counties.  The urban center of Huangshan was originally the city of '''Tunxi''', and is now called [[Tunxi District]].  Locals still call the city Tunxi to distinguish urban core from other parts of Huangshan.\n\t\nHuangshan occupies the southernmost part of Anhui. It is bordered by [[Chizhou]] to the northwest, [[Xuancheng]] to the northeast, [[Jiangxi]] Province to the southwest and [[Zhejiang]] Province to the southeast.  Huangshan's history dates back to the time of the [[First Emperor]].  The city's current jurisdiction covers much of the historical and cultural region of [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u5fbd\u5dde}}), which together with [[Anqing]] formed the name of Anhui Province. Huangshan is home to two [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]], [[Mount Huangshan]] and [[Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui - Xidi and Hongcun|Hongcun and Xidi, the ancient villages of southern Anhui]].  It is a leading tourist destination in China.\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Loujiepailou.jpg|thumb|right|An old gate in the city]]\n\nThe [[prefecture-level city]] of Huangshan administers 7 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including 3 [[District of China|districts]] and 4 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].\n\n* [[Tunxi District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5c6f\u6eaa\u533a}})\n* [[Huangshan District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9ec4\u5c71\u533a}})\n* [[Huizhou District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5fbd\u5dde\u533a}})\n* [[She County, Anhui|She County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b59\u53bf}})\n* [[Xiuning County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f11\u5b81\u53bf}})\n* [[Yi County, Anhui|Yi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9edf\u53bf}})\n* [[Qimen County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7941\u95e8\u53bf}})\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Map\n|-\n|<div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Huangshan.png|width=666|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=1390|y=1180|scale=666/2220|text=[[Tunxi District|'''Tunxi''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1070|y=420|scale=666/2220|text=[[Huangshan District|'''Huangshan''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1280|y=900|scale=666/2220|text=[[Huizhou District|'''Huizhou''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1760|y=1000|scale=666/2220|text=[[She County, Anhui|'''She<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1080|y=1260|scale=666/2220|text=[[Xiuning County|'''Xiuning<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=850|y=740|scale=666/2220|text=[[Yi County, Anhui|'''Yi<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=500|y=980|scale=666/2220|text=[[Qimen County|'''Qimen<br>County''']]}}\n</div>\n|}\n\nThese are further divided into 145 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 42 [[town of China|towns]], 100 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 3 [[subdistrict]]s.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Qimen Hao Ya.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Keemun tea]]\n[[Keemun tea]] is produced in [[Qimen County]], and the tea is named for the county. [[Mao feng]], a green tea, is produced in neighboring counties. Tourism, centered on [[Mount Huang]] and including other scenic and historic sites (such as [[Xidi]] and [[Hongcun]]), is an important part of the Huangshan economy.\n\n==Transportation==\nDue to rugged terrain, Huangshan was traditionally a secluded region.  The Xinan River provided an outlet to the east.  Winding, narrow roads through Huang Mountains made trips to Xuancheng, Wuhu, Guichi and the Yangtze River slow and arduous.  In recent decades, improvements to the transportation infrastructure have made the city and its surrounding tourist attractions more accessible.\n\n===Air===\nThe [[Huangshan Tunxi International Airport]], also referred to as the Tunxi Airport, is located in Tunxi District and is known by the IATA abbreviation '''TXN'''.  The airport was built in 1958 and was expanded in 2000.  It offers daily flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Guangzhou, and weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Shenzhen.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Huangshan train station.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Huangshan Train Station.]]\nHuangshan City is currently served by only one railway line, the [[Anhui\u2013Jiangxi Railway]], which was completed in 1982 and has stations in Jixi County, She County, Tunxi District, Xiuning County, and Qimen County.  From the main Huangshan City Railway Station in Tunxi, direct train service is available to Nanjing, Shanghai, Bengbu, Huaibei, Qingdao and Beijing among other cities the north, and points to the south including Jingdezhen, Yingtan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Kunming.\n\nHuangshan is accessible via high-speed rail through the [[Hefei\u2013Fuzhou high-speed railway]] and the [[Hangzhou\u2013Huangshan intercity railway]].\n\n===Road===\nHuangshan is now a highway junction city.  The Huizhou-Hangzhou Expressway runs east to Hanghzou.  The Hefei-Tongling-Huangshan Expressway heads north to Tongling on the Yangtze River and then to Hefei, the Anhui provincial capital.  The Huangshan-Taling-Taolin Expressway extends southwest to Wuyuan in Jiangxi Province.  The Huangshan-Quzhou-Nanping Expressway, currently under construction, will run southeast through Zhejiang Province to Nanping in Fujian Province.  Until the expressways were built in the first decade of the 21st century, Huangshan's main roads were National Route G205 and Provincial Route S326, which follow the Anhui-Zhejiang Railway.\n\n==Cultural history==\n[[File:Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui \u2013 Xidi and Hongcun-114145.jpg|thumb|Ancient Villages in Southern Anhui \u2013 [[Xidi]] and [[Hongcun]].]]\nIn the Ming dynasty, {{ill|Zheng Zhizhen|zh|\u912d\u4e4b\u73cd}}  \u912d\u4e4b\u73cd (1518-1595), a native of the [[Huizhou District|Huizhou]], [[Anhui]],  village of [[Qingxi, Anhui|Qingxi]] wrote the opera [http://www.worldcat.org/title/xin-ke-chu-xiang-yin-zhu-quan-shan-mulian-jiu-mu-xing-xiao-xi-wen-8-juan/oclc/44465384&referer=brief_results  \u76ee\u84ee\u6551\u6bcd\u884c\u5b5d\u6232\u6587 Mulian jiu mu xing xiao xi wen (Mulian rescues his mother)].<ref>[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7110/ Mulian Rescues His Mother]  [[World Digital Library]].</ref> According to local legend, Zheng was blind when he wrote the opera and was restored to full sight by a grateful [[Guanyin]] (the legend also has it that when Zheng later wrote a love story he went blind again). {{sfnb|Guo|2005| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJWTY9dIs5oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=according%20local%20legend%20Zhizhen&f=false 89]}}\n\nIn 2011, Local authorities promoted performance of the Ming dynasty play [[Mulian Rescues His Mother]] as a tourist attraction.<ref>[http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/culture/arts/12/8159-1.htm Mulian Opera 'Ghost Drama' Revival] [http://www.womenofchina.cn/ Women of China] March 24, 2011.</ref>\n\n== Other notes ==\nIn early 2008, the BBC broadcast a series of 5 documentaries on life for schoolchildren in China, called \"Chinese School\". One of the three schools documented was [[Xiuning High School]], the top school in the county.
