The city of [[Jaisalmer]] is the administrative headquarters of the district.it is appx 289&nbsp;km from the Jodhpur city and 559&nbsp;km from the Jaipur city.\n\nAs of 2011 it is the least populous district of Rajasthan (out of [[Districts of Rajasthan|33]]).<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:D\u00e9sert-du-Thar.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Thar desert]]]]\n\nIt is the largest district of Rajasthan and third largest in the country in area.\n\nJaisalmer District lies in the [[Thar Desert]], which straddles the border of India and [[Pakistan]]. It is bounded on the northeast by [[Bikaner District]], on the east by [[Jodhpur District]], on the south by [[Barmer District]], and on the west and north by [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe district is located within a rectangle lying between 26\u00b0.4\u2019 \u201328\u00b0.23' North parallel and 69\u00b0.20'-72\u00b0.42' east meridians.\n\nThe length of international border attached to the district is 464 &nbsp;km.\n\nJaisalmer is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming a part of the great Indian desert. The general aspect of the area is that of an interminable sea of sandhills, of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150&nbsp;ft. Those in the west are covered with log bushes, those in the east with tufts of long grass. Water is scarce, and generally [[brackish]]; the average depth of the wells is said to be about 250&nbsp;ft. There are no perennial streams, and only one small river, the [[Kakni]], which, after flowing a distance of 28 m., spreads over a large surface of flat ground, and forms a lake [[orjhil]] called the [[Bhuj-Jhil]]. The climate is dry and healthy. Throughout Jaisalmer only raincrops, such as [[Pearl millet|bajra]], [[joar]], motif, [[Sesame|til]], etc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, [[barley]], etc., are very rare. Owing to the scant rainfall, [[irrigation]] is almost unknown.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = Jaisalmer \n|Jan high C = 23.7\n|Feb high C = 27.2\n|Mar high C = 32.8\n|Apr high C = 38.4\n|May high C = 47.7\n|Jun high C = 48.0\n|Jul high C = 42.8\n|Aug high C = 36.0\n|Sep high C = 36.5\n|Oct high C = 36.1\n|Nov high C = 31.1\n|Dec high C = 25.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan low C =  7.9\n|Feb low C =  10.9\n|Mar low C =  16.8\n|Apr low C = 22.2\n|May low C = 25.7\n|Jun low C = 27.1\n|Jul low C = 26.5\n|Aug low C = 25.4\n|Sep low C = 24.3\n|Oct low C = 20.5\n|Nov low C =  13.8\n|Dec low C =  8.9\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm =  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm =  4.0\n|Mar precipitation mm =  3.2\n|Apr precipitation mm =  18.1\n|May precipitation mm = 9.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 16.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 79.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 16.2\n|Oct precipitation mm =  2.5\n|Nov precipitation mm =  1.3\n|Dec precipitation mm =  2.5\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  0.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  1.0\n|Mar precipitation days =  0.9\n|Apr precipitation days =  0.4\n|May precipitation days = 0.8\n|Jun precipitation days = 1.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation days = 2.1\n|Oct precipitation days = 0.4\n|Nov precipitation days =  1.1\n|Dec precipitation days =  0.5\n|source 1 = [http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01593.htm WMO]\n|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Jaisalmer one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the twelve districts in Rajasthan currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |date=8 September 2009 |title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme |publisher=National Institute of Rural Development |url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |accessdate=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=75,551|13=1911|14=87,162|15=1921|16=69,224|17=1931|18=78,646|19=1941|20=96,958|21=1951|22=1,09,658|23=1961|24=1,41,242|25=1971|26=1,67,824|27=1981|28=2,43,082|29=1991|30=3,44,517|31=2001|32=5,08,247|33=2011|34=6,69,919|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{bar box\n|title=Religions in Jaisalmer District<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW08C-01%20MDDS.XLS |title=C-1 Population By Religious Community (Rajasthan) |publisher=Census India |accessdate=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n|titlebar=#Fcd116\n|left1=Religion\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Hindus]]|orange|74.19}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims]]|green|25.10}}\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Jaisalmer district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 669,919,<ref name=\"districtcensus\"/> roughly equal to the nation of [[Equatorial Guinea]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nEquatorial Guinea 668,225 July 2011 est.\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[North Dakota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

It is bounded on the northeast by [[Bikaner District]], on the east by [[Jodhpur District]], on the south by [[Barmer District]], and on the west and north by [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe district is located within a rectangle lying between 26\u00b0.4\u2019 \u201328\u00b0.23' North parallel and 69\u00b0.20'-72\u00b0.42' east meridians.\n\nThe length of international border attached to the district is 464 &nbsp;km.\n\nJaisalmer is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming a part of the great Indian desert. The general aspect of the area is that of an interminable sea of sandhills, of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150&nbsp;ft. Those in the west are covered with log bushes, those in the east with tufts of long grass. Water is scarce, and generally [[brackish]]; the average depth of the wells is said to be about 250&nbsp;ft. There are no perennial streams, and only one small river, the [[Kakni]], which, after flowing a distance of 28 m., spreads over a large surface of flat ground, and forms a lake [[orjhil]] called the [[Bhuj-Jhil]]. The climate is dry and healthy. Throughout Jaisalmer only raincrops, such as [[Pearl millet|bajra]], [[joar]], motif, [[Sesame|til]], etc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, [[barley]], etc., are very rare. Owing to the scant rainfall, [[irrigation]] is almost unknown.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = Jaisalmer \n|Jan high C = 23.7\n|Feb high C = 27.2\n|Mar high C = 32.8\n|Apr high C = 38.4\n|May high C = 47.7\n|Jun high C = 48.0\n|Jul high C = 42.8\n|Aug high C = 36.0\n|Sep high C = 36.5\n|Oct high C = 36.1\n|Nov high C = 31.1\n|Dec high C = 25.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan low C =  7.9\n|Feb low C =  10.9\n|Mar low C =  16.8\n|Apr low C = 22.2\n|May low C = 25.7\n|Jun low C = 27.1\n|Jul low C = 26.5\n|Aug low C = 25.4\n|Sep low C = 24.3\n|Oct low C = 20.5\n|Nov low C =  13.8\n|Dec low C =  8.9\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm =  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm =  4.0\n|Mar precipitation mm =  3.2\n|Apr precipitation mm =  18.1\n|May precipitation mm = 9.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 16.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 79.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 16.2\n|Oct precipitation mm =  2.5\n|Nov precipitation mm =  1.3\n|Dec precipitation mm =  2.5\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  0.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  1.0\n|Mar precipitation days =  0.9\n|Apr precipitation days =  0.4\n|May precipitation days = 0.8\n|Jun precipitation days = 1.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation days = 2.1\n|Oct precipitation days = 0.4\n|Nov precipitation days =  1.1\n|Dec precipitation days =  0.5\n|source 1 = [http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01593.htm WMO]\n|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Jaisalmer one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the twelve districts in Rajasthan currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |date=8 September 2009 |title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme |publisher=National Institute of Rural Development |url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |accessdate=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=75,551|13=1911|14=87,162|15=1921|16=69,224|17=1931|18=78,646|19=1941|20=96,958|21=1951|22=1,09,658|23=1961|24=1,41,242|25=1971|26=1,67,824|27=1981|28=2,43,082|29=1991|30=3,44,517|31=2001|32=5,08,247|33=2011|34=6,69,919|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{bar box\n|title=Religions in Jaisalmer District<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW08C-01%20MDDS.XLS |title=C-1 Population By Religious Community (Rajasthan) |publisher=Census India |accessdate=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n|titlebar=#Fcd116\n|left1=Religion\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Hindus]]|orange|74.19}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims]]|green|25.10}}\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Jaisalmer district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 669,919,<ref name=\"districtcensus\"/> roughly equal to the nation of [[Equatorial Guinea]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nEquatorial Guinea 668,225 July 2011 est.\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[North Dakota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

Her works are created in Impressionist and Expressionist styles using broad swaths of vibrant colors to combine an interest in light and in depiction of spontaneous moments and are well known for vivid, rich painted still life, beach scenes along the [[Massachusetts]] coast.<ref name=\"tuttart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com/2014/02/Jane-Peterson.html|title=Tutt' Art|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> Her works are housed in museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of the City of New York|the Museum of the City of New York]], [[National Museum of Women in the Arts|the National Museum of Women in the Arts]] and [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington D.C, and [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] and [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nPeterson was born in [[Elgin, Illinois]], on November 28, 1876 as the daughter of an [[Elgin Watch Company]] employee and a homemaker. Though she was born as Jennie Christine she changed her name to Jane right after she graduated from high school, in 1894.<ref name=foxvalleyarts>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxvalleyarts.org/Peterson_Jane.htm|title=Fox Valley Arts Hal of Fame|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> She didn't receive any formal art training as a child, but knew intuitively how to paint everything she saw.<ref name=calvin /> As a child she attended public school. Later, at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, she learned about the [[Pratt Institute]], a fairly new technical school in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and took an art aptitude test. After she applied to Pratt, in 1895, she was accepted in the art department and Peterson borrowed $300 from her mother to study there. In 1901 she graduated and went on to study oil and watercolor painting at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in New York City with Frank DuMond.<ref name=cadwellgallery /><ref name=heller>{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=edited by Jules|last2=Heller|first2=Nancy G.|title=North American women artists of the twentieth century : a biographical dictionary|date=1995|publisher=Garland|location=New York|isbn=0-8240-6049-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/northamericanwom00hellrich/page/435 435]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/northamericanwom00hellrich/page/435}}</ref>\n\n=== Study in Europe ===\nLike young artists of her time, Jane took several grand tours of the European continents and studied under several famous European artists: Peterson studied with the Welsh artist [[Frank Brangwyn]] in Venice and London, [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla|Joaquin Sorolla]] in Madrid, and French Painter [[Jacques Blanchard|Jacques Blanche]] and sculptor [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote|Andre L\u2019Hote]] in Paris. Under their guidance she gained a diverse and expert knowledge of painting techniques and composition. While in Paris, Peterson also became friends with American Art writer and experimenter [[Gertrude Stein|Gertrude]] and American Art Collector and critic [[Leo Stein]], becoming a regular at the sibling's various gatherings where the guests included [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. She lived in rooms in Montparnasse located around the corner from [[Gertrude Stein]]\u2019s salon, where on Saturday evening artists and art enthusiasts would gather to view and discuss Stein's seminal collection of Modern art. During her time in Paris, Peterson was surrounded by [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], and the beginnings of [[Cubism]]. When she first arrived in Paris in 1907 Picasso was already paving the way with innovative and experimental techniques, displaying Fauvist tendencies and going beyond them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/peterson-biography.html|title=Jane Peterson {{!}} Biography {{!}} 1876-1965|website=www.caldwellgallery.com|access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\nA solo exhibition of Peterson's work was held in 1908 at the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais]] that won many acclaims among Parisian critics, including one audience who later even set up an exhibition at the [[St. Botolph Club|St. Botolph club]] in Boston the next year of Jane Peterson's earlier works.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com/2014/02/Jane-Peterson.html|title=Jane Peterson {{!}} Impressionist / Expressionist painter|website=www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com|access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Influence of Sorolla ===\nOne year after Peterson returned to Chicago, she went back to Europe and studied under  [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla|Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]] in Madrid. Of all her mentors, Sorolla had the most influence upon Peterson's style. After 1909, Peterson's canvases become more daring with color, as layers of loose brushstrokes combine to represent the shimmer of Summer's light in southern Europe.\n\nPeterson was following Sorolla for many aspects. After Sorolla held exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, Peterson's works exhibited in 1910 for her trip to North Africa. Also it was Sorolla that persuaded Peterson to follow him to New York where he had been commissioned to do a portrait of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], the founder of the [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany&Co]]. At Tiffany's invitation, Peterson joined the artistic circle at Laurelton, his summer estate in Oyster Bay, Long Island.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Solo Trip to Egypt ===\nIn 1910, Peterson travelled alone to Egypt and Algiers in North Africa \u2013 an extremely bold act for a woman in the early 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Artistic Style ===\nPeterson's work is hard to put into one or two single category of art. Actually, her works are more like a blend of several most prominent styles in the turn of the 20th century under the influence of her academic artistic training of many influences in both America and across Europe: Impressionism, Neo- and Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Nabi, and Fauvism. Peterson love to use loose brushwork and bold colors in her paintings.<ref name=\"cadwellgallery\" />  From 1910 through 1916 Peterson became increasingly linked stylistically to fellow American, [[Maurice Prendergast]]. They shared similar interests in subject matter, and both had traveled and studied in Europe. Peterson and Prendergast had comparable technical skills of astute observation and loved colorful subjects but Peterson's linear movement is more aggressively flowing than Prendergast's. Gradually, they each developed a unique style, according to Charlotte Streiffer Rubenstein.<sup>3</sup>\n\n=== Interest in Watercolor ===\nIn 1912, Peterson went back to Paris, where she associated with the members of the American Art Association which included American Impressionist Painter [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]]. Her interest in watercolor started at this time, and, on her return to the United States in 1913, she began a six-year tenure at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in New York as an instructor of watercolor painting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Friendship with Tiffany ===\nJane Peterson formed a good bond with her patron and friend, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], American stained glass and jewelry designer and the head of the famous firm [[Tiffany Studios]]. Their many trips together inspired Peterson's works: In 1916, Peterson joined Tiffany in a painting adventure and expedition to Alaska and the Canadian Northwest.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Undomestic Female Painter ===\nAs a result of her adventures around the globe, Peterson painted people, events and scenery that are of importance around the globe when many women favored painting domestic scenes. For example, during World War One, Peterson joined the war effort painting military portraits and patriotic scenes of women rolling bandages and folding blankets at the Red Cross Center. Spending six months in Turkey in 1924, she painted streets scenes in the Islamic cities of Constantinople and Broosa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Marriage===\nPeterson married a corporate lawyer, M. Bernard Philipp, when she was fifty years old. Four years after her husband's death, she married a New Haven [[physician]] James S. McCarty in 1939. Their marriage lasted for less than a year.<ref name=heller />\n\n===Death===\nDuring her lifetime, Peterson was featured in more than 80 one-woman exhibitions before her death on August 14, 1965.\n<ref name=\"cadwellgallery\">{{cite web|url=https://www.caldwellgallery.com/artists/jane-peterson/biography|title=Caldwell Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Mott Street New York by Jane Peterson 1916 New York Watercolor Club Exhibition catalog.png|thumb|Black and white reproduction of ''Mott Street, New York'', 1916 New York Watercolor Club Exhibition]]\n\nPeterson taught in [[Elmira, New York]], as a drawing supervisor of public school teachers in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and the Maryland Institute in [[Baltimore]] for three years.

She was living during the time of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], and at the beginning of [[Cubism]].<ref name=cadwellgallery />\n\nPeterson started to exhibit her works in 1908 at the Societe des Artistes Francais in Paris France. She exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in Boston, Massachusetts, the Knoedler Gallery in [[New York City]], and at the Bendann's Art Gallery in Baltimore, [[Maryland]]. From 1910 to 1914 Peterson had her own exhibitions at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

Her works are created in Impressionist and Expressionist styles using broad swaths of vibrant colors to combine an interest in light and in depiction of spontaneous moments and are well known for vivid, rich painted still life, beach scenes along the [[Massachusetts]] coast.<ref name=\"tuttart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com/2014/02/Jane-Peterson.html|title=Tutt' Art|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> Her works are housed in museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of the City of New York|the Museum of the City of New York]], [[National Museum of Women in the Arts|the National Museum of Women in the Arts]] and [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington D.C, and [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] and [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nPeterson was born in [[Elgin, Illinois]], on November 28, 1876 as the daughter of an [[Elgin Watch Company]] employee and a homemaker. Though she was born as Jennie Christine she changed her name to Jane right after she graduated from high school, in 1894.<ref name=foxvalleyarts>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxvalleyarts.org/Peterson_Jane.htm|title=Fox Valley Arts Hal of Fame|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> She didn't receive any formal art training as a child, but knew intuitively how to paint everything she saw.<ref name=calvin /> As a child she attended public school. Later, at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, she learned about the [[Pratt Institute]], a fairly new technical school in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and took an art aptitude test. After she applied to Pratt, in 1895, she was accepted in the art department and Peterson borrowed $300 from her mother to study there. In 1901 she graduated and went on to study oil and watercolor painting at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in New York City with Frank DuMond.<ref name=cadwellgallery /><ref name=heller>{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=edited by Jules|last2=Heller|first2=Nancy G.|title=North American women artists of the twentieth century : a biographical dictionary|date=1995|publisher=Garland|location=New York|isbn=0-8240-6049-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/northamericanwom00hellrich/page/435 435]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/northamericanwom00hellrich/page/435}}</ref>\n\n=== Study in Europe ===\nLike young artists of her time, Jane took several grand tours of the European continents and studied under several famous European artists: Peterson studied with the Welsh artist [[Frank Brangwyn]] in Venice and London, [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla|Joaquin Sorolla]] in Madrid, and French Painter [[Jacques Blanchard|Jacques Blanche]] and sculptor [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote|Andre L\u2019Hote]] in Paris. Under their guidance she gained a diverse and expert knowledge of painting techniques and composition. While in Paris, Peterson also became friends with American Art writer and experimenter [[Gertrude Stein|Gertrude]] and American Art Collector and critic [[Leo Stein]], becoming a regular at the sibling's various gatherings where the guests included [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. She lived in rooms in Montparnasse located around the corner from [[Gertrude Stein]]\u2019s salon, where on Saturday evening artists and art enthusiasts would gather to view and discuss Stein's seminal collection of Modern art. During her time in Paris, Peterson was surrounded by [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], and the beginnings of [[Cubism]]. When she first arrived in Paris in 1907 Picasso was already paving the way with innovative and experimental techniques, displaying Fauvist tendencies and going beyond them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/peterson-biography.html|title=Jane Peterson {{!}} Biography {{!}} 1876-1965|website=www.caldwellgallery.com|access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\nA solo exhibition of Peterson's work was held in 1908 at the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais]] that won many acclaims among Parisian critics, including one audience who later even set up an exhibition at the [[St. Botolph Club|St. Botolph club]] in Boston the next year of Jane Peterson's earlier works.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com/2014/02/Jane-Peterson.html|title=Jane Peterson {{!}} Impressionist / Expressionist painter|website=www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com|access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Influence of Sorolla ===\nOne year after Peterson returned to Chicago, she went back to Europe and studied under  [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla|Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]] in Madrid. Of all her mentors, Sorolla had the most influence upon Peterson's style. After 1909, Peterson's canvases become more daring with color, as layers of loose brushstrokes combine to represent the shimmer of Summer's light in southern Europe.\n\nPeterson was following Sorolla for many aspects. After Sorolla held exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, Peterson's works exhibited in 1910 for her trip to North Africa. Also it was Sorolla that persuaded Peterson to follow him to New York where he had been commissioned to do a portrait of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], the founder of the [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany&Co]]. At Tiffany's invitation, Peterson joined the artistic circle at Laurelton, his summer estate in Oyster Bay, Long Island.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Solo Trip to Egypt ===\nIn 1910, Peterson travelled alone to Egypt and Algiers in North Africa \u2013 an extremely bold act for a woman in the early 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Artistic Style ===\nPeterson's work is hard to put into one or two single category of art. Actually, her works are more like a blend of several most prominent styles in the turn of the 20th century under the influence of her academic artistic training of many influences in both America and across Europe: Impressionism, Neo- and Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Nabi, and Fauvism. Peterson love to use loose brushwork and bold colors in her paintings.<ref name=\"cadwellgallery\" />  From 1910 through 1916 Peterson became increasingly linked stylistically to fellow American, [[Maurice Prendergast]]. They shared similar interests in subject matter, and both had traveled and studied in Europe. Peterson and Prendergast had comparable technical skills of astute observation and loved colorful subjects but Peterson's linear movement is more aggressively flowing than Prendergast's. Gradually, they each developed a unique style, according to Charlotte Streiffer Rubenstein.<sup>3</sup>\n\n=== Interest in Watercolor ===\nIn 1912, Peterson went back to Paris, where she associated with the members of the American Art Association which included American Impressionist Painter [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]]. Her interest in watercolor started at this time, and, on her return to the United States in 1913, she began a six-year tenure at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in New York as an instructor of watercolor painting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Friendship with Tiffany ===\nJane Peterson formed a good bond with her patron and friend, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], American stained glass and jewelry designer and the head of the famous firm [[Tiffany Studios]]. Their many trips together inspired Peterson's works: In 1916, Peterson joined Tiffany in a painting adventure and expedition to Alaska and the Canadian Northwest.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Undomestic Female Painter ===\nAs a result of her adventures around the globe, Peterson painted people, events and scenery that are of importance around the globe when many women favored painting domestic scenes. For example, during World War One, Peterson joined the war effort painting military portraits and patriotic scenes of women rolling bandages and folding blankets at the Red Cross Center. Spending six months in Turkey in 1924, she painted streets scenes in the Islamic cities of Constantinople and Broosa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Marriage===\nPeterson married a corporate lawyer, M. Bernard Philipp, when she was fifty years old. Four years after her husband's death, she married a New Haven [[physician]] James S. McCarty in 1939. Their marriage lasted for less than a year.<ref name=heller />\n\n===Death===\nDuring her lifetime, Peterson was featured in more than 80 one-woman exhibitions before her death on August 14, 1965.\n<ref name=cadwellgallery>{{cite web|url=http://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/peterson-biography.html|title=The Caldwell Gallery|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Mott Street New York by Jane Peterson 1916 New York Watercolor Club Exhibition catalog.png|thumb|Black and white reproduction of ''Mott Street, New York'', 1916 New York Watercolor Club Exhibition]]\n\nPeterson taught in [[Elmira, New York]], as a drawing supervisor of public school teachers in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and the Maryland Institute in [[Baltimore]] for three years.

She was living during the time of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], and at the beginning of [[Cubism]].<ref name=cadwellgallery />\n\nPeterson started to exhibit her works in 1908 at the Societe des Artistes Francais in Paris France. She exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in Boston, Massachusetts, the Knoedler Gallery in [[New York City]], and at the Bendann's Art Gallery in Baltimore, [[Maryland]]. From 1910 to 1914 Peterson had her own exhibitions at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

Elias Rogers served as a [[Toronto City Council|Toronto alderman]] for St. Lawrence Ward in 1887.<ref>http://torontoist.com/2010/01/historicist_a_business_quartet/</ref> The family descends from [[Timothy Rogers (Quaker leader)|Timothy Rogers]] (1756\u20131834), a Quaker leader who founded [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] and [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] in what is now Ontario.\n\n==Career==\nRogers first became interested in radio when he saw a receiver at age 11. By 1913, he was noted in local newspapers for his skill at operating a radio station, which at the time was an impressive technical accomplishment. Rogers worked as a radio officer on Great Lakes passenger ships during the summers of 1916-1919 inclusive. In 1921, Rogers operated the only Canadian (and only [[Spark-gap transmitter|spark-gap]]) station to successfully compete in the first amateur trans-Atlantic radio competition. Rogers held the [[amateur radio]] [[call sign]] 3BP, and joined the Canadian chapter of the [[American Radio Relay League]] in 1921.\n\nIn the early 1920s, radio transmitters and receivers ran on large and expensive [[battery (vacuum tube)|batteries]] to provide the high voltages needed for the [[vacuum tube]]s used. Early attempts at producing a radio receiver to operate on household [[alternating current]] were unsuccessful, since tubes designed for the low current supply from batteries were unsatisfactory when operated on 25- or 60-hertz alternating current. The batteries were also extremely large and bulky.\n\nIn April 1924, Rogers travelled to the United States and saw experimental AC receiving tubes at the laboratories of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] in Pittsburgh. He purchased the patent rights to the experimental alternating current tubes of Frederick S. McCullough. After further development, Rogers produced a design of vacuum tube that would operate on alternating current.\n\nBy 1925, Rogers had introduced not only a complete radio receiver using the new tubes, but had also produced a \"[[battery eliminator]]\" ([[power supply]]) that could be used with other manufacturers' receivers to eliminate the expensive batteries. By August 1925, the Rogers [[batteryless radio]] was in commercial sales, the first radio receiver in the world to operate from household current. At a time when a schoolteacher might earn $1,000 per year, the top-of-the-line Rogers radio sold for $370. Rogers formed the company \"Standard Radio Manufacturing\" (later [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company]]) to produce radio receivers using the new design of vacuum tubes.\n\nIn 1927, Rogers founded [[CFRB]] (''Canada\u2019s First Rogers Batteryless'') radio station. The station is owned today by [[Bell Media]].\n\nIn 1930, he married Velma Melissa Taylor. Three years later, they had a son, [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.]], who grew up to build [[Rogers Communications]] into a media conglomerate. The family lived at 49 Nanton Avenue in the [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] area of Toronto.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/house-where-a-radio-pioneer-spent-his-boyhood/article662911/ ''House where a radio pioneer spent his boyhood''] \u2013 49 Nanton Avenue, Rosedale, Toronto.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRogers died suddenly in 1939 due to complications of a hemorrhage.
