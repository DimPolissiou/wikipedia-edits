The team began play in 1998 in the [[Arena Football League]] as an expansion team. They were last coached by [[Steve Thonn]]. Their home arena was the [[Van Andel Arena]].\n\n==History==\nThe team became the [[Detroit Drive]] in 1988 and, in 1994, became the [[Massachusetts Marauders]] for one season. Three years later, DP Fox Ventures, L.L.C. bought the team and moved it to Grand Rapids.\n\nThe team under its final name dates back to 1997. They began play as a professional team in 1998 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when [[Dan DeVos]] purchased the [[Massachusetts Marauders|Detroit Drive/Massachusetts Marauders]] franchise out of bankruptcy court. Grand Rapids was the smallest market in which the AFL had a franchise at the times of its disbanding. The Rampage played in the Van Andel Arena, which is also the home of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]'s [[Grand Rapids Griffins]]. They competed in the Central Division of the American Conference.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Rampage started play in 1998 under coach [[Michael Trigg]]. In 2001, with notable players [[Clint Dolezel]], and [[Terrill Shaw]], the Rampage went on to win their first [[ArenaBowl XV|ArenaBowl]]. This game was broadcast live on the [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Network]].\n\nThe Rampage's official mascot was a [[Rhinoceros]] named '''Blitz'''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |title=http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |access-date=2006-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110073220/http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |archive-date=2005-01-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Rampage had a rivalry with the [[Nashville Kats]], one which dates back to the original Kats. This rivalry solidified with the Rampage's defeat of Nashville in ArenaBowl XV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/rampage-down-kats-in-arenabowl/n-2707556 |title=Rampage down Kats in Arenabowl |date=August 19, 2001 |publisher=OurSports Central |work=oursportscentral.com |accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Rampage also shared a rivalry with the [[Chicago Rush]], known as the Amtrak Classic, after the [[Amtrak]] railway system which connects the two cities. On July 6, 2008, the Amtrak Classic added an interesting chapter as the Rampage, losers of their last six meetings with Chicago, defeated their heavily favored opponents on the road. Grand Rapids entered the game as a 6 seed, and upended the #1 seeded Rush 58-41, in a game of controversial penalties and brawls.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, it was announced that the Rampage were officially out of business and had no plans to return.<ref>http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2010/03/rampage_dead_as_arena_football.html</ref>\n\n==Logo==\nThe Rampage's logo was a red [[rhinoceros]]. Its end zone is unique as being the only end zone that does not feature a team name or city. It simply says Arena Football in red with a black background.\n\n==Rampage highlights==\n* On Sunday, June 23, 2002, the Rampage hosted a game against the [[Georgia Force]]. After a low-scoring first quarter, the Rampage took a 28-15 halftime lead. However, the Force refused to go down, as they had a 41-35 lead with only 12 seconds left in the game. On one play, Quarterback Clint Dolezel threw a game-winning 31-yd touchdown pass to Offensive Specialist [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1974)|Steve Smith]] (who hadn't played a down that game until the final play). The Rampage would win 42-41. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #13.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29355&CLIP_FILE_ID=33336&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29355&CLIP_FILE_ID=33336&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* On Saturday, February 5, 2005, in a road game against their division-rival, the [[Colorado Crush]], Rampage quarterback [[Michael Bishop (football player)|Michael Bishop]] became the first Arena Football League player to run for 100 yards in a single game. It was only Bishop's third-ever start, yet he accomplished this feat on just six attempts. Despite falling 72-56, Bishop's helped set a bold new record. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #12.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29664&CLIP_FILE_ID=33642&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29664&CLIP_FILE_ID=33642&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* In a pregame warm-up, quarterback Michael Bishop threw a pass from one end zone, across the field, through the uprights and into the stands. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is tied at #9.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=30570&CLIP_FILE_ID=34585&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=30570&CLIP_FILE_ID=34585&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* On Monday, March 24, 2008, The Rampage set the AFL record for the most points scored in a single game by a road team, beating the [[Kansas City Brigade]] 92-52. [[James MacPherson (American football)|James Macpherson]] went 24-27, nine touchdowns, and 307 yards in his first start for the Rampage. MacPherson would later go on to break the franchise record for touchdown passes in a later game.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Main|List of Grand Rapids Rampage seasons}}\n\n==Notable players==\n\n===Arena Football Hall of Famers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" style= \"background: #d33;

In 2001, with notable players [[Clint Dolezel]], and [[Terrill Shaw]], the Rampage went on to win their first [[ArenaBowl XV|ArenaBowl]]. This game was broadcast live on the [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Network]].\n\nThe Rampage's official mascot was a [[Rhinoceros]] named '''Blitz'''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |title=http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |access-date=2006-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110073220/http://rampagefootball.com/community/mascot/ |archive-date=2005-01-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Rampage had a rivalry with the [[Nashville Kats]], one which dates back to the original Kats. This rivalry solidified with the Rampage's defeat of Nashville in [[ArenaBowl XV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/rampage-down-kats-in-arenabowl/n-2707556 |title=Rampage down Kats in Arenabowl |date=August 19, 2001 |publisher=OurSports Central |work=www.oursportscentral.com |accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Rampage also shared a rivalry with the [[Chicago Rush]], known as the Amtrak Classic, after the [[Amtrak]] railway system which connects the two cities. On July 6, 2008, the Amtrak Classic added an interesting chapter as the Rampage, losers of their last six meetings with Chicago, defeated their heavily favored opponents on the road. Grand Rapids entered the game as a 6 seed, and upended the #1 seeded Rush 58-41, in a game of controversial penalties and brawls.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, it was announced that the Rampage were officially out of business and had no plans to return.<ref>http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2010/03/rampage_dead_as_arena_football.html</ref>\n\n==Logo==\nThe Rampage's logo was a red [[rhinoceros]]. Its end zone is unique as being the only end zone that does not feature a team name or city. It simply says Arena Football in red with a black background.\n\n==Rampage highlights==\n* On Sunday, June 23, 2002, the Rampage hosted a game against the [[Georgia Force]]. After a low-scoring first quarter, the Rampage took a 28-15 halftime lead. However, the Force refused to go down, as they had a 41-35 lead with only 12 seconds left in the game. On one play, Quarterback [[Clint Dolezel]] threw a game-winning 31-yd touchdown pass to Offensive Specialist [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1974)|Steve Smith]] (who hadn't played a down that game until the final play). The Rampage would win 42-41. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #13.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29355&CLIP_FILE_ID=33336&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29355&CLIP_FILE_ID=33336&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* On Saturday, February 5, 2005, in a road game against their division-rival, the [[Colorado Crush]], Rampage quarterback [[Michael Bishop (football player)|Michael Bishop]] became the first Arena Football League player to run for 100 yards in a single game. It was only Bishop's third-ever start, yet he accomplished this feat on just six attempts. Despite falling 72-56, Bishop's helped set a bold new record. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #12.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29664&CLIP_FILE_ID=33642&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=29664&CLIP_FILE_ID=33642&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* In a pregame warm-up, quarterback Michael Bishop threw a pass from one end zone, across the field, through the uprights and into the stands. On the AFL's 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is tied at #9.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=30570&CLIP_FILE_ID=34585&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND http://www.arenafootball.com/mediaPlayer/video.dbml?DB_MENU_ID=&SPSID=38064&SPID=3172&DB_OEM_ID=3500&CLIP_ID=30570&CLIP_FILE_ID=34585&CONTENT_TYPE=ONDEMAND]</ref>\n* On Monday, March 24, 2008, The Rampage set the AFL record for the most points scored in a single game by a road team, beating the [[Kansas City Brigade]] 92-52. [[James MacPherson (American football)|James Macpherson]] went 24-27, nine touchdowns, and 307 yards in his first start for the Rampage. MacPherson would later go on to break the franchise record for touchdown passes in a later game.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Main article|List of Grand Rapids Rampage seasons}}\n\n==Notable players==\n\n===Arena Football Hall of Famers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" style= \"background: #d33; color: white\" align=\"center\"| '''Grand Rapids Rampage Hall of Famers'''\n|-\n!width=60px style=\"background: #000; color: white\" |No.\n!style=\"background: #000; color: white\" |Name\n!style=\"background: #000; color: white\" |Year inducted\n!style=\"background: #000; color: white\" |Position(s)\n!style=\"background: #000; color: white\" |Years w/ Rampage\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 13 || [[Clint Dolezel]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2012 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Quarterback|QB]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2001-2003\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 84 || [[Fred Gayles]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Wide Receiver|WR]]/[[Defensive Back|DB]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1998\n|}\n\n===Individual awards===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#d33; color:white;\"| '''Kicker of the Year'''\n|-\n!

It has also been shown that the sequence divergence between DNA from humans and chimpanzees varies greatly. For example, the sequence divergence varies between 0% to 2.66% between non-coding, non-repetitive [[genomic]] regions of humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"Chen Li 2001\">{{cite journal |author=Chen, F.C. |author2=Li, W.H. | year = 2001 | title = Genomic divergences between humans and other hominoids and the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 444\u2013456 | doi = 10.1086/318206 | pmid = 11170892 | pmc = 1235277}}</ref> The percentage of nucleotides in the human genome (hg38) that had one-to-one exact matches in the chimpanzee genome (pantro6) was 84.38%.

Summing up:\n*The sequence divergence varies significantly between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas.\n*For most DNA sequences, humans and chimpanzees appear to be most closely related, but some point to a human-gorilla or chimpanzee-gorilla [[clade]].\n*The human genome has been sequenced, as well as the chimpanzee genome.

[[Chromosome 2 (human)|Human chromosome 2]] is a fusion of two chromosomes 2a and 2b that remained separate in the other primates.<ref>Ken Miller in the ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' trial transcripts.</ref>\n\n===Divergence times===\nThe divergence time of humans from other apes is of great interest. One of the first molecular studies, published in 1967 measured immunological distances (IDs) between different primates.<ref name=\"Sarich Wilson 1967\">{{cite journal |author=Sarich, V.M. |author2=Wilson, A.C. | year = 1967 | title = Immunological time scale for hominid evolution | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3805 | pages = 1200\u20131203 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3805.1200 | pmid = 4964406|bibcode = 1967Sci...158.1200S}}</ref> Basically the study measured the strength of immunological response that an [[antigen]] from one species (human albumin) induces in the immune system of another species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla and [[Old World monkey]]s). Closely related species should have similar antigens and therefore weaker immunological response to each other's antigens. The immunological response of a species to its own antigens (e.g. human to human) was set to be 1.\n\nThe ID between humans and gorillas was determined to be 1.09, that between humans and chimpanzees was determined as 1.14. However the distance to six different Old World monkeys was on average 2.46, indicating that the African apes are more closely related to humans than to monkeys. The authors consider the divergence time between Old World monkeys and hominoids to be 30 million years ago (MYA), based on fossil data, and the immunological distance was considered to grow at a constant rate. They concluded that divergence time of humans and the African apes to be roughly ~5 MYA. That was a surprising result. Most scientists at that time thought that humans and great apes diverged much earlier (>15 MYA).\n\nThe gorilla was, in ID terms, closer to human than to chimpanzees; however, the difference was so slight that the [[Speciation#Genetics|trichotomy]] could not be resolved with certainty. Later studies based on molecular genetics were able to resolve the trichotomy: chimpanzees are [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] closer to humans than to gorillas. However, some divergence times estimated later (using much more sophisticated methods in molecular genetics) do not substantially differ from the very first estimate in 1967, but a recent paper<ref>{{cite journal |last=Venn|first=Oliver|title=Strong male bias drives germline mutation in chimpanzees|journal=Science|date=June 2014|volume=344|number=6189|pages=1272\u20131275|doi=10.1126/science.344.6189.1272|last2=Turner|first2=Isaac |last3=Mathieson|first3=Iain |last4= de Groot|first4=Natasja |last5= Bontrop|first5=Ronald |last6= McVean|first6=Gil |pmid=24926018 |pmc=4746749|bibcode=2014Sci...344.1272V}}</ref> puts it at 11\u201314 MYA.\n\n===Divergence times and ancestral effective population size===\n[[File:SpeciesVsGeneDivergenceTime.svg|thumb|400px|right|The sequences of the DNA segments diverge earlier than the species. A large effective population size in the ancestral population (left) preserves different variants of the DNA segments (=alleles) for a longer period of time. Therefore, on average, the gene divergence times (t<sub>A</sub> for DNA segment A; t<sub>B</sub> for DNA segment B) will deviate more from the time the species diverge (t<sub>S</sub>) compared to a small ancestral effective population size (right).]]\n\nCurrent methods to determine divergence times use DNA sequence alignments and [[molecular clock]]s. Usually the molecular clock is calibrated assuming that the orangutan split from the African apes (including humans) 12-16 MYA. Some studies also include some old world monkeys and set the divergence time of them from hominoids to 25-30 MYA. Both calibration points are based on very little fossil data and have been criticized.<ref name=\"Yoder Yang 2000\">{{cite journal |author=Yoder, A.D. |author2=Yang, Z. | date=1 July 2000| title = Estimation of primate speciation dates using local molecular clocks | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 1081\u20131090 | url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/7/1081 | pmid = 10889221 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026389}}</ref>\n\nIf these dates are revised, the divergence times estimated from molecular data will change as well. However, the relative divergence times are unlikely to change. Even if we can't tell absolute divergence times exactly, we can be pretty sure that the divergence time between chimpanzees and humans is about sixfold shorter than between chimpanzees (or humans) and monkeys.\n\nOne study (Takahata ''et al.'', 1995) used 15 DNA sequences from different regions of the genome from human and chimpanzee and 7 DNA sequences from human, chimpanzee and gorilla.<ref name=Takahata>{{cite journal |author1=Takahata, N. |author2=Satta, Y. |author3=Klein, J. | year = 1995 | title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans | journal = Theor Popul Biol | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 198\u2013221 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026 | pmid = 7482371}}</ref> They determined that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than gorillas. Using various statistical methods, they estimated the divergence time human-chimp to be 4.7 MYA and the divergence time between gorillas and humans (and chimps) to be 7.2 MYA.\n\nAdditionally they estimated the [[effective population size]] of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees to be ~100,000. This was somewhat surprising since the present day effective population size of humans is estimated to be only ~10,000. If true that means that the human lineage would have experienced an immense decrease of its effective population size (and thus genetic diversity) in its evolution. (see [[Toba catastrophe theory]])\n\n[[Image:Ancestralsizehuman.svg|thumb|300px|right|A and B are two different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. In the upper figure they fit to the species tree. The DNA that is present in today's gorillas diverged earlier from the DNA that is present in today's humans and chimps. Thus both loci should be more similar between human and chimp than between gorilla and chimp or gorilla and human. In the lower graph, locus A has a more recent common ancestor in human and gorilla compared to the chimp sequence. Whereas chimp and gorilla have a more recent common ancestor for locus B. Here the gene trees are incongruent to the species tree.]]\n\nAnother study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA segments from a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan.<ref name=\"Chen Li 2001\" /> When the DNA sequences were concatenated to a single long sequence, the generated [[neighbor-joining]] tree supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade with 100% bootstrap (that is that humans and chimpanzees are the closest related species of the four). When three species are fairly closely related to each other (like human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).\n\nThe shorter internodal time span (T<sub>IN</sub>) the more common are incongruent gene trees. The effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) of the internodal population determines how long genetic lineages are preserved in the population. A higher effective population size causes more incongruent gene trees. Therefore, if the internodal time span is known, the ancestral effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees can be calculated.\n\nWhen each segment was analyzed individually, 31 supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 10 supported the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, and 12 supported the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade. Using the molecular clock the authors estimated that gorillas split up first 6.2-8.4 MYA and chimpanzees and humans split up 1.6-2.2 million years later (internodal time span) 4.6-6.2 MYA. The internodal time span is useful to estimate the ancestral effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.\n\nA [[parsimonious]] analysis revealed that 24 loci supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 7 supported the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, 2 supported the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade and 20 gave no resolution. Additionally they took 35 protein coding loci from databases. Of these 12 supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 3 the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, 4 the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade and 16 gave no resolution. Therefore, only ~70% of the 52 loci that gave a resolution (33 intergenic, 19 protein coding) support the 'correct' species tree. From the fraction of loci which did not support the species tree and the internodal time span they estimated previously, the effective population of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was estimated to be ~52 000 to 96 000. This value is not as high as that from the first study (Takahata), but still much higher than present day effective population size of humans.\n\nA third study (Yang, 2002) used the same dataset that Chen and Li used but estimated the ancestral effective population of 'only' ~12,000 to 21,000, using a different statistical method.<ref name=\"Yang 2002\">{{cite journal | author = Yang, Z. | date=1 December 2002| title = Likelihood and Bayes estimation of ancestral population sizes in hominoids using data from multiple loci | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 1811\u20131823 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/162/4/1811 | pmid = 12524351 | format = abstract page | pmc = 1462394 }}</ref>\n\n==Genetic differences between humans and other great apes==\nThe alignable sequences within genomes of humans and chimpanzees differ by about 35 million single-nucleotide substitutions.

These regions show signs of being subject to natural selection, leading to the evolution of distinctly human traits. Two examples are [[HAR1F]], which is believed to be related to brain development and HAR2 (a.k.a. [[HACNS1]]) that may have played a role in the development of the [[Thumb|opposable thumb]].\n\nIt has also been hypothesized that much of the difference between humans and chimpanzees is attributable to the [[regulation of gene expression]] rather than differences in the genes themselves.

It has also been shown that the sequence divergence between DNA from humans and chimpanzees varies greatly. For example, the sequence divergence varies between 0% to 2.66% between non-coding, non-repetitive [[genomic]] regions of humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"Chen Li 2001\">{{cite journal |author=Chen, F.C. |author2=Li, W.H. | year = 2001 | title = Genomic divergences between humans and other hominoids and the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 444\u2013456 | doi = 10.1086/318206 | pmid = 11170892 | pmc = 1235277}}</ref> The percentage of nucleotides in the human genome (hg38) that had one-to-one exact matches in the chimpanzee genome (pantro6) was 84.38%.

Dover'' trial transcripts.</ref>\n\n===Divergence times===\nThe divergence time of humans from other apes is of great interest. One of the first molecular studies, published in 1967 measured immunological distances (IDs) between different primates.<ref name=\"Sarich Wilson 1967\">{{cite journal |author=Sarich, V.M. |author2=Wilson, A.C. | year = 1967 | title = Immunological time scale for hominid evolution | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3805 | pages = 1200\u20131203 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3805.1200 | pmid = 4964406|bibcode = 1967Sci...158.1200S}}</ref> Basically the study measured the strength of immunological response that an [[antigen]] from one species (human albumin) induces in the immune system of another species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla and [[Old World monkey]]s). Closely related species should have similar antigens and therefore weaker immunological response to each other's antigens. The immunological response of a species to its own antigens (e.g. human to human) was set to be 1.\n\nThe ID between humans and gorillas was determined to be 1.09, that between humans and chimpanzees was determined as 1.14. However the distance to six different Old World monkeys was on average 2.46, indicating that the African apes are more closely related to humans than to monkeys. The authors consider the divergence time between Old World monkeys and hominoids to be 30 million years ago (MYA), based on fossil data, and the immunological distance was considered to grow at a constant rate. They concluded that divergence time of humans and the African apes to be roughly ~5 MYA. That was a surprising result. Most scientists at that time thought that humans and great apes diverged much earlier (>15 MYA).\n\nThe gorilla was, in ID terms, closer to human than to chimpanzees; however, the difference was so slight that the [[Speciation#Genetics|trichotomy]] could not be resolved with certainty. Later studies based on molecular genetics were able to resolve the trichotomy: chimpanzees are [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] closer to humans than to gorillas. However, some divergence times estimated later (using much more sophisticated methods in molecular genetics) do not substantially differ from the very first estimate in 1967, but a recent paper<ref>{{cite journal |last=Venn|first=Oliver|title=Strong male bias drives germline mutation in chimpanzees|journal=Science|date=June 2014|volume=344|number=6189|pages=1272\u20131275|doi=10.1126/science.344.6189.1272|last2=Turner|first2=Isaac |last3=Mathieson|first3=Iain |last4= de Groot|first4=Natasja |last5= Bontrop|first5=Ronald |last6= McVean|first6=Gil |pmid=24926018 |pmc=4746749|bibcode=2014Sci...344.1272V}}</ref> puts it at 11\u201314 MYA.\n\n===Divergence times and ancestral effective population size===\n[[File:SpeciesVsGeneDivergenceTime.svg|thumb|400px|right|The sequences of the DNA segments diverge earlier than the species. A large effective population size in the ancestral population (left) preserves different variants of the DNA segments (=alleles) for a longer period of time. Therefore, on average, the gene divergence times (t<sub>A</sub> for DNA segment A; t<sub>B</sub> for DNA segment B) will deviate more from the time the species diverge (t<sub>S</sub>) compared to a small ancestral effective population size (right).]]\n\nCurrent methods to determine divergence times use DNA sequence alignments and [[molecular clock]]s. Usually the molecular clock is calibrated assuming that the orangutan split from the African apes (including humans) 12-16 MYA. Some studies also include some old world monkeys and set the divergence time of them from hominoids to 25-30 MYA. Both calibration points are based on very little fossil data and have been criticized.<ref name=\"Yoder Yang 2000\">{{cite journal |author=Yoder, A.D. |author2=Yang, Z. | date=1 July 2000| title = Estimation of primate speciation dates using local molecular clocks | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 1081\u20131090 | url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/7/1081 | pmid = 10889221 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026389}}</ref>\n\nIf these dates are revised, the divergence times estimated from molecular data will change as well. However, the relative divergence times are unlikely to change. Even if we can't tell absolute divergence times exactly, we can be pretty sure that the divergence time between chimpanzees and humans is about sixfold shorter than between chimpanzees (or humans) and monkeys.\n\nOne study (Takahata ''et al.'', 1995) used 15 DNA sequences from different regions of the genome from human and chimpanzee and 7 DNA sequences from human, chimpanzee and gorilla.<ref name=Takahata>{{cite journal |author1=Takahata, N. |author2=Satta, Y. |author3=Klein, J. | year = 1995 | title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans | journal = Theor Popul Biol | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 198\u2013221 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026 | pmid = 7482371}}</ref> They determined that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than gorillas. Using various statistical methods, they estimated the divergence time human-chimp to be 4.7 MYA and the divergence time between gorillas and humans (and chimps) to be 7.2 MYA.\n\nAdditionally they estimated the [[effective population size]] of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees to be ~100,000. This was somewhat surprising since the present day effective population size of humans is estimated to be only ~10,000. If true that means that the human lineage would have experienced an immense decrease of its effective population size (and thus genetic diversity) in its evolution. (see [[Toba catastrophe theory]])\n\n[[Image:Ancestralsizehuman.svg|thumb|300px|right|A and B are two different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. In the upper figure they fit to the species tree. The DNA that is present in today's gorillas diverged earlier from the DNA that is present in today's humans and chimps. Thus both loci should be more similar between human and chimp than between gorilla and chimp or gorilla and human. In the lower graph, locus A has a more recent common ancestor in human and gorilla compared to the chimp sequence. Whereas chimp and gorilla have a more recent common ancestor for locus B. Here the gene trees are incongruent to the species tree.]]\n\nAnother study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA segments from a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan.<ref name=\"Chen Li 2001\" /> When the DNA sequences were concatenated to a single long sequence, the generated [[neighbor-joining]] tree supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade with 100% bootstrap (that is that humans and chimpanzees are the closest related species of the four). When three species are fairly closely related to each other (like human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).\n\nThe shorter internodal time span (T<sub>IN</sub>) the more common are incongruent gene trees. The effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) of the internodal population determines how long genetic lineages are preserved in the population. A higher effective population size causes more incongruent gene trees. Therefore, if the internodal time span is known, the ancestral effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees can be calculated.\n\nWhen each segment was analyzed individually, 31 supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 10 supported the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, and 12 supported the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade. Using the molecular clock the authors estimated that gorillas split up first 6.2-8.4 MYA and chimpanzees and humans split up 1.6-2.2 million years later (internodal time span) 4.6-6.2 MYA. The internodal time span is useful to estimate the ancestral effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.\n\nA [[parsimonious]] analysis revealed that 24 loci supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 7 supported the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, 2 supported the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade and 20 gave no resolution. Additionally they took 35 protein coding loci from databases. Of these 12 supported the ''Homo''-''Pan'' clade, 3 the ''Homo''-''Gorilla'' clade, 4 the ''Pan''-''Gorilla'' clade and 16 gave no resolution. Therefore, only ~70% of the 52 loci that gave a resolution (33 intergenic, 19 protein coding) support the 'correct' species tree. From the fraction of loci which did not support the species tree and the internodal time span they estimated previously, the effective population of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was estimated to be ~52 000 to 96 000. This value is not as high as that from the first study (Takahata), but still much higher than present day effective population size of humans.\n\nA third study (Yang, 2002) used the same dataset that Chen and Li used but estimated the ancestral effective population of 'only' ~12,000 to 21,000, using a different statistical method.<ref name=\"Yang 2002\">{{cite journal | author = Yang, Z. | date=1 December 2002| title = Likelihood and Bayes estimation of ancestral population sizes in hominoids using data from multiple loci | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 1811\u20131823 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/162/4/1811 | pmid = 12524351 | format = abstract page | pmc = 1462394 }}</ref>\n\n==Genetic differences between humans and other great apes==\nThe alignable sequences within genomes of humans and chimpanzees differ by about 35 million single-nucleotide substitutions.

These regions show signs of being subject to natural selection, leading to the evolution of distinctly human traits. Two examples are [[HAR1F]], which is believed to be related to brain development and HAR2 (a.k.a. [[HACNS1]]) that may have played a role in the development of the [[Thumb|opposable thumb]].\n\nIt has also been hypothesized that much of the difference between humans and chimpanzees is attributable to the [[regulation of gene expression]] rather than differences in the genes themselves.

She was built by [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in [[Canada]] in 1983 as '''''Kalvik''''' as part of an Arctic drilling system developed by [[BeauDril]], the drilling subsidiary of [[Gulf Canada Resources]]. After the offshore oil exploration in the [[Beaufort Sea]] ended in the early 1990s, she was sold to the Canadian shipping company [[Fednav]] in 1997 and renamed '''''Arctic Kalvik'''''. In 2003, she was purchased by [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] and transferred to Russia.\n\n''Vladimir Ignatyuk'' has a sister ship, {{ship|CCGS|Terry Fox}}, which is operated by the [[Canadian Coast Guard]].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Gulf Canada Resources]] began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between {{convert|40|and|60|m|ft}} while afloat. The intention of this development was to overcome the relatively short operating window of [[drillship]]s during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands in the Canadian part of the [[Beaufort Sea]]. The drilling units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour [[ice management]] and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for [[BeauDril]], Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.<ref name=\"marks1982\">{{Citation|last=Marks|first=Adams|title=Gulf's Proposed Drilling Systems for the Beaufort Sea|journal=APOA Review|volume=5|issue=2|pages=9\u201312|year=1982}}</ref>\n\nThe icebreaker design was provided by the Montreal-based engineering company [[German & Milne]]. During the development phase, the hull form was extensively tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) [[ice tank]] with particular emphasis of preventing broken ice floes from flowing under the hull and into the propellers. The result was a production-friendly [[developable surface|fully-developable hull form]] with a semi-spoon bow and large ice plough.<ref name=\"canadianshipping_oct1983\">{{cite|url=https://trid.trb.org/view/418548|title=Kalvik and Terry Fox: Arctic Class 4 icebreaking, anchor-handling tug/supply vessels|date=October 1983|work=Canadian Shipping and Marine Engineering|pages=31\u201335|volume=55}}</ref><ref name=\"smei_sept1983\">{{cite|title=Gulf's Arctic class 4 multi-purpose icebreakers|date=September 1983|work=Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering International|page=348}}</ref> The construction of the two icebreakers was awarded to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in December 1979 and the work was split between the company's [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] divisions.

She was built by [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in [[Canada]] in 1983 as '''''Kalvik''''' as part of an Arctic drilling system developed by [[BeauDril]], the drilling subsidiary of [[Gulf Canada Resources]]. After the offshore oil exploration in the [[Beaufort Sea]] ended in the early 1990s, she was sold to the Canadian shipping company [[Fednav]] in 1997 and renamed '''''Arctic Kalvik'''''. In 2003, she was purchased by [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] and transferred to Russia.\n\n''Vladimir Ignatyuk'' has a sister ship, {{ship|CCGS|Terry Fox}}, which is operated by the [[Canadian Coast Guard]].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Gulf Canada Resources]] began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between {{convert|40|and|60|m|ft}} while afloat. The intention of this development was to overcome the relatively short operating window of [[drillship]]s during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands in the Canadian part of the [[Beaufort Sea]]. The drilling units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour [[ice management]] and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for [[BeauDril]], Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.<ref name=\"marks1982\">{{Citation|last=Marks|first=Adams|title=Gulf's Proposed Drilling Systems for the Beaufort Sea|journal=APOA Review|volume=5|issue=2|pages=9\u201312|year=1982}}</ref>\n\nThe icebreaker design was provided by the Montreal-based engineering company [[German & Milne]]. During the development phase, the hull form was extensively tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) [[ice tank]] with particular emphasis of preventing broken ice floes from flowing under the hull and into the propellers. The result was a production-friendly [[developable surface|fully-developable hull form]] with a semi-spoon bow and large ice plough.<ref name=\"canadianshipping_oct1983\">{{cite|url=https://trid.trb.org/view/418548|title=Kalvik and Terry Fox: Arctic Class 4 icebreaking, anchor-handling tug/supply vessels|date=October 1983|work=Canadian Shipping and Marine Engineering|pages=31\u201335|volume=55}}</ref><ref name=\"smei_sept1983\">{{cite|title=Gulf's Arctic class 4 multi-purpose icebreakers|date=September 1983|work=Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering International|page=348}}</ref> The construction of the two icebreakers was awarded to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in December 1979 and the work was split between the company's [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] divisions.

Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expectations for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources.

Nasmyth was a landscape painter and was reluctant to take on the work however he met with Burns and they became friends resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which he never fully completed due to his concern over spoiling what he had already achieved. [[John Beugo]] the engraver arranged several sittings with Burns and produced a better likeness as confirmed by [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]].

The 'Geddes Burns' is now with an owner in America and copies have been published.

In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 [[St. Reinold's Church, Dortmund|St. Reinold's Church]] first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an [[Imperial Free City]] and one of the first cities in Europe with an official [[Brewing right]] in 1293.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n[[File:Alte Markt Dortmund.JPG|thumb|Old market [[St. Reinoldi (Dortmund)|St. Reinolds]]]]\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court ({{lang-de|Freistuhl}}) was in Dortmund, in a square between two [[linden tree]]s, one of which was known as the ''[[Gerichtslinde|Femelinde]]''. With the growing influence of [[Cologne]] during the 15th century, the seat was moved to [[Arnsberg]] in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the [[Anglo-Hanseatic War]] (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - {{Interlanguage link multi|Stadtgymnasium Dortmund|de}}.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} The [[List of earthquakes in Germany|1661 earthquake]] made the [[Reinoldikirche]] collapse.\n\n===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===\n[[File:Dortmund um 1804.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-industrial Dortmund in 1804.]]\nWith the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]], with as a result that it was no longer a [[free imperial city]]. [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau]] did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince Willem Frederik]] (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the [[County of Dortmund]] then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine|Rhine treaty]]. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite [[Ruhr (department)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1910}} At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The state mining authority of the [[Ruhr area]] was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Westphalia]], Dortmund was a district seat within [[Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg]] until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\n\nDuring the [[industrialisation]] of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for [[coal]] and [[steel]]. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]] - a right military coup launched against the [[Social Democratic]]-led government. Radical workers formed a [[Ruhr Red Army|Red Army]] who fought the [[freikorps]] units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] was carried out by the invasion of [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1157/her_mit_der_kohle.html Her mit der Kohle \u2013 ''Der Spiegel'' EinesTages; retrieved on 4.

A few historic buildings as the main churches [[Reinoldikirche]] and [[Marienkirche, Dortmund|Marienkirche]] were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1946. The [[Zollern II/IV Colliery|LWL-Industriemuseum]] was founded in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lwl.org/industriemuseum/standorte/zeche-zollern/english |title=The Zollern Colliery|publisher=LWL Industrial Museum|accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref> In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining.

The city limits of Dortmund itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4{{nbsp}}million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): [[Bochum]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Waltrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Kamen]], [[Unna]], [[Holzwickede]], [[Schwerte]], [[Hagen]], [[Herdecke]] and [[Witten]]. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of [[Westphalia]] which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of [[Westphalian Lowland]] and adjoins with the [[Ardey Hills]] in the south of the city to the [[Sauerland]].\n\nThe [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] forms the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Hengsteysee]] next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of [[Hagen]] and [[Herdecke]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The [[Klusenberg]], a hill that is part of the [[Ardey Hills|Ardey]] range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund {{cvt|254.3|m|||}}. There is also a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at {{cvt|48.9|m|||}}.\n\nThe [[Emscher]] is a small river and has its wellspring in [[Holzwickede]], east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Bottrop]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Dinslaken]], where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n===Boroughs===\n[[File:Dortmund Bezirke und Nachbargemeinden.png|thumb|right|Municipalities and neighbouring communities]]\n[[File:Kreuzviertel_Althoffblock_alte_Hoeschzentrale_von_Florianturm.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of urban [[Kreuzviertel]]]]\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called '''''Stadtbezirke'''''), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area ([[Eving]], Scharnhorst, Brackel, [[Aplerbeck]], [[H\u00f6rde]], Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each ''''' Stadtbezirk''''' is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\n\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n*Stadtzentrum ''(City centre)''\n*Hafenviertel ''(Harbour Quarter)''\n*Nordmarkt\n*Borsigplatz\n*Kaiserviertel\n*Kronenviertel\n*Kreuzviertel\n*Klinikviertel ''(Clinical Quarter)''\n*Saarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\n*Unionviertel\n*Gartenstadt\n\n===Climate===\nDortmund is situated in the [[Temperateness|temperate climate zone]] with [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately {{convert|9|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season.

During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called [[Ruhr]] attracted up to 500,000 ethnic [[Poles]], [[Mazurs|Masurians]] and [[Silesians]] from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] in a migration known as ''[[Ostflucht]]'' (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from [[France]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is [[List of cities in Germany by population|the eighth largest city in Germany]] after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Ruhr]] agglomeration.\n\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains.

Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\n\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirchentag.org.uk |title=Kirchentag 2019 |website=Stadtportal Dortmund}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is [[Ullrich Sierau]] with variable majorities between [[SPD]], [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]\n\n===City government past and present===\n[[File:Stadtwappen Dortmund.png|thumb|upright|left|Dortmund coat of arms]]\n[[File:Dortmund Rathaus IMGP6046.jpg|thumb|Townhall Dortmund]]\n[[File:AmtshausDortmundAplerbeck.jpg|thumb|Townhall Aplerbeck, one of twelve district councils]]\nDortmund is one of nineteen [[Independent city|independent district-free cities]] (''[[Urban districts of Germany|kreisfreie St\u00e4dte]]'') in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a [[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (''Bezirk'') has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\n\nDortmund is often called the ''Herzkammer der SPD'' (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was [[Fritz Hen\u00dfler]]. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): [[Ullrich Sierau]] (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\n\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n===International relations===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nDortmund is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Dortmunder St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/internationales/staedtepartnerschaften/start_sp_1/index.html|website=dortmund.de|publisher=Dortmund|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Leeds]], United Kingdom, since 1949\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Amiens]], France, since 1960\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, since 1973\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], United States, since 1977\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Netanya]], Israel, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|SRB}} [[Novi Sad]], Serbia, since 1981\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Zwickau]], Germany, since 1989\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Xi\u2019an]], China, since 1991\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Trabzon]], Turkey, since 2014\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Dortmund Panorama.jpg|thumb|Dortmund with RWE-Tower and churches of Reinoldi, Petri and Marien on the right]]\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like [[Altes Stadthaus, Dortmund|Altes Stadthaus]] or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the [[Reinoldikirche]] and the [[Marienkirche, Dortmund|Marienkirche]]. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War&nbsp;II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the [[Hellweg|Westen-/Ostenhellweg]], part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\n\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|title=Wiederaufbau - 20.

Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the [[second World War]], relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, [[Kreuzviertel]] forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228181111/https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html#Szeneviertel |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEven today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: [[Sascha Schmitz]], [[Christina Hammer]] and players of [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\n[[File:Nordstadt_Dortmund_Hafenviertel.jpg|thumb|Dockland - young restaurant and bars scene]]\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42&nbsp;km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in [[Ruhr]] the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial [[urban area]] that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the [[Westfalenh\u00fctte]] steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtbezirke/stbzportal_innenstadtnord/leben_in_in//|title=Die Stadt im Wiederaufbau|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\n\nThe area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html// |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330025233/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the [[Expo 2000]] in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein [[Borussia Dortmund]] was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/BVB/History/1909//|title=BVB 09 - Back to our History - 1909 - Borussia Dortmund - bvb.de|website=www.bvb.de}}</ref>\n\n====Kaiserviertel====\n[[File:Dortmund Kaiserstra\u00dfenviertel.jpg|thumb|Cherry Blossom Avenue]]\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\n\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n====Unionviertel====\n[[File:Unionviertel Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Rheinische Stra\u00dfe]]\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-c-c-e.de/kreativquartiere-ruhr.html|title=ecce - european centre for creative economy: Kreativ.Quartiere Ruhr|website=www.e-c-c-e.de}}</ref>\n\n====H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix====\n[[File:Phoenixsee Dortmund, Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Lake Phoenix]]\n[[File:Dortmund Hoerde Hoerder Burg 05.jpg|thumb|H\u00f6rde castle]]\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of [[Herdecke]], [[Witten]], [[Bochum]], [[Castrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Unna]] und [[Schwerte]]. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the [[Emscher]] and Lake Phoenix.\n\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in [[Europe]]. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of [[ThyssenKrupp]] newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund.

Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\n\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\n*[[Zalando]]\n*[[HSBC Trinkaus]]\n*[[German Handball Association]]\n*[[Handball-Bundesliga|Handball-Bundesliga (HBL)]]\n*[[German public bank|Academy of the German public Bank]]\n*[[Mircosonic]]\n\nThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title=Phoenix-See - Leisure & Culture - dortmund.de|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\nThe River [[Emscher]] flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public [[water board]] [[Emschergenossenschaft]].

The [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the [[Ruhr Area]]. It crosses the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-German border as a continuation of the Dutch [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] and crosses the [[Rhine]], leads through the [[Ruhr valley]] toward [[Bochum]], becoming B&nbsp;1 ([[Bundesstra\u00dfe 1|Bundesstra\u00dfe&nbsp;1]]) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A&nbsp;44 near [[Holzwickede]]. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to ''Der Spiegel'', it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\n\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the [[Kamener Kreuz]] interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] to the west these form the [[Dortmund Beltway]] (''Dortmunder Autobahnring'').\n\n===Cycling===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a [[Bike freeway]] called the ''Radschnellweg Ruhr'' (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n===Rail transport===\n[[File:HBFDo.JPG|thumb|Dortmund central railway station]]\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\nThe central train station ([[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Dortmund with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Berlin]] and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive [[Dortmund Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and bus system. The U-Bahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of [[L\u00fcnen]] in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last [[tram]]s on the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|title=Neuer U-Bahn-Tunnel: keine Stra\u00dfenbahn mehr in Dortmunder City|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Oliver Volmerich|date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092307/http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|archive-date=14 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system.

It is the largest city (by area and population) of the [[Ruhr]], Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of [[Westphalia]]. On the [[Emscher]] and [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] rivers ([[tributaries]] of the [[Rhine]]), it lies in the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]] and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern [[Ruhr]].

Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during [[World War II]]. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.<ref name=\"backtonormandy.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.backtonormandy.org/the-history/air-force-operations/airplanes-in-actions/lancaster/raf-bomber-command-748-lancasters-record-attack-dortmund-12-march-1945.html|title=Support - Main Menu}}</ref>\n\nThe region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology [[biomedical technology]], [[micro systems technology]], and also [[Service (economics)|services]].

The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by [[Westphalia]]n Saxons. During the [[Saxon Wars]], it was taken by the [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]] in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under [[Widukind]]) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775.

In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 [[St. Reinold's Church, Dortmund|St. Reinold's Church]] first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an [[Imperial Free City]] and one of the first cities in Europe with an official [[Brewing right]] in 1293.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n[[File:Alte Markt Dortmund.JPG|thumb|Old market [[St. Reinoldi (Dortmund)|St. Reinolds]]]]\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court ({{lang-de|Freistuhl}}) was in Dortmund, in a square between two [[linden tree]]s, one of which was known as the ''[[Gerichtslinde|Femelinde]]''. With the growing influence of [[Cologne]] during the 15th century, the seat was moved to [[Arnsberg]] in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the [[Anglo-Hanseatic War]] (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - {{Interlanguage link multi|Stadtgymnasium Dortmund|de}}.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} The [[List of earthquakes in Germany|1661 earthquake]] made the [[Reinoldikirche]] collapse.\n\n===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===\n[[File:Dortmund um 1804.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-industrial Dortmund in 1804.]]\nWith the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]], with as a result that it was no longer a [[free imperial city]]. [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau]] did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince Willem Frederik]] (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the [[County of Dortmund]] then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine|Rhine treaty]]. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite [[Ruhr (department)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1910}} At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The state mining authority of the [[Ruhr area]] was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Westphalia]], Dortmund was a district seat within [[Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg]] until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\n\nDuring the [[industrialisation]] of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for [[coal]] and [[steel]]. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]] - a right military coup launched against the [[Social Democratic]]-led government. Radical workers formed a [[Ruhr Red Army|Red Army]] who fought the [[freikorps]] units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] was carried out by the invasion of [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1157/her_mit_der_kohle.html Her mit der Kohle \u2013 ''Der Spiegel'' EinesTages; retrieved on 4.

A few historic buildings as the main churches [[Reinoldikirche]] and [[Marienkirche, Dortmund|Marienkirche]] were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1946.

The city limits of Dortmund itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4{{nbsp}}million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): [[Bochum]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Waltrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Kamen]], [[Unna]], [[Holzwickede]], [[Schwerte]], [[Hagen]], [[Herdecke]] and [[Witten]]. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of [[Westphalia]] which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of [[Westphalian Lowland]] and adjoins with the [[Ardey Hills]] in the south of the city to the [[Sauerland]].\n\nThe [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] forms the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Hengsteysee]] next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of [[Hagen]] and [[Herdecke]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The [[Klusenberg]], a hill that is part of the [[Ardey Hills|Ardey]] range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund {{cvt|254.3|m|||}}. There is also a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at {{cvt|48.9|m|||}}.\n\nThe [[Emscher]] is a small river and has its wellspring in [[Holzwickede]], east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Bottrop]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Dinslaken]], where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n===Boroughs===\n[[File:Dortmund Bezirke und Nachbargemeinden.png|thumb|right|Municipalities and neighbouring communities]]\n[[File:Kreuzviertel_Althoffblock_alte_Hoeschzentrale_von_Florianturm.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of urban [[Kreuzviertel]]]]\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called '''''Stadtbezirke'''''), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area ([[Eving]], Scharnhorst, Brackel, [[Aplerbeck]], [[H\u00f6rde]], Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each ''''' Stadtbezirk''''' is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\n\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n*Stadtzentrum ''(City centre)''\n*Hafenviertel ''(Harbour Quarter)''\n*Nordmarkt\n*Borsigplatz\n*Kaiserviertel\n*Kronenviertel\n*Kreuzviertel\n*Klinikviertel ''(Clinical Quarter)''\n*Saarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\n*Unionviertel\n*Gartenstadt\n\n===Climate===\nDortmund is situated in the [[Temperateness|temperate climate zone]] with [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately {{convert|9|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of [[urban heat islands]] is typical. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Geografie & Klima - Stadtportr\u00e4t - Leben in Dortmund - Stadtportal dortmund.de|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115215001/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/geografie_und_klima/index.html|accessdate=2020-03-19|date=2013-01-15|work=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box |metric first= Yes |single line= Yes |location= Dortmund \n|Jan record high C=14.6\n|Feb record high C=18.5\n|Mar record high C=23.5\n|Apr record high C=30.2\n|May record high C=34.4\n|Jun record high C=34.9\n|Jul record high C=36.8\n|Aug record high C=37.6\n|Sep record high C=33.4\n|Oct record high C=28.6\n|Nov record high C=20.1\n|Dec record high C=16.1\n|year record high C=37.6\n|Jan high C= 4\n|Feb high C= 5\n|Mar high C= 9\n|Apr high C= 13\n|May high C= 18\n|Jun high C= 21\n|Jul high C= 22\n|Aug high C= 22\n|Sep high C= 19\n|Oct high C= 15\n|Nov high C= 9\n|Dec high C= 5\n|Jan low C= \u22121\n|Feb low C= \u22121\n|Mar low C= 2\n|Apr low C= 4\n|May low C= 8\n|Jun low C= 11\n|Jul low C= 13\n|Aug low C= 13\n|Sep low C= 10\n|Oct low C= 7\n|Nov low C= 3\n|Dec low C= 1\n|rain colour= green\n|Jan rain mm= 65\n|Feb rain mm= 56\n|Mar rain mm= 53\n|Apr rain mm= 57\n|May rain mm= 68\n|Jun rain mm= 78\n|Jul rain mm= 93\n|Aug rain mm= 93\n|Sep rain mm= 67\n|Oct rain mm= 60\n|Nov rain mm= 71\n|Dec rain mm= 77\n|Jan rain days= 19\n|Feb rain days= 17\n|Mar rain days= 14\n|Apr rain days= 16\n|May rain days= 14\n|Jun rain days= 14\n|Jul rain days= 17\n|Aug rain days= 16\n|Sep rain days= 15\n|Oct rain days= 17\n|Nov rain days= 19\n|Dec rain days= 19\n|source 1= Wetter Kontor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetterkontor.de/de/klima/klima2.asp?land=de&stat=10416 |title=Klima Deutschland, Dortmund - Klimadiagramm, Klimatabelle - WetterKontor |publisher=Wetterkontor.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ '''Largest groups of foreign residents'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2017|url=https://www.dortmund.de/media/p/statistik_3/statistik/bevoelkerung/02_03_Bevoelkerung_Geschlecht_Ausgewaehlte_Staatsangehoerigkeiten.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115201620/https://www.dortmund.de/media/p/statistik_3/statistik/bevoelkerung/02_03_Bevoelkerung_Geschlecht_Ausgewaehlte_Staatsangehoerigkeiten.pdf|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n!Nationality !!

During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called [[Ruhr]] attracted up to 500,000 ethnic [[Poles]], [[Mazurs|Masurians]] and [[Silesians]] from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] in a migration known as ''[[Ostflucht]]'' (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from [[France]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is [[List of cities in Germany by population|the eighth largest city in Germany]] after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Ruhr]] agglomeration.\n\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities.<ref name=\"dortmund.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |title=Dortmund 2012: Mehr Einwohner, mehr Studierende, mehr \u00dcbernachtungen - Nachrichtenportal - Leben in Dortmund - Stadtportal |publisher=Dortmund.de |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211183302/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |archivedate=11 February 2013 }}</ref> Data of the [[2011 EU census|EU-wide 2011 census]] revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures.

Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (''Bezirk'') has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\n\nDortmund is often called the ''Herzkammer der SPD'' (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was [[Fritz Hen\u00dfler]]. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): [[Ullrich Sierau]] (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\n\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n===International relations===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nDortmund is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Dortmunder St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/internationales/staedtepartnerschaften/start_sp_1/index.html|website=dortmund.de|publisher=Dortmund|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Leeds]], United Kingdom, since 1949\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Amiens]], France, since 1960\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, since 1973\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], United States, since 1977\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Netanya]], Israel, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|SRB}} [[Novi Sad]], Serbia, since 1981\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Zwickau]], Germany, since 1989\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Xi\u2019an]], China, since 1991\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Trabzon]], Turkey, since 2014\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Dortmund Panorama.jpg|thumb|Dortmund with RWE-Tower and churches of Reinoldi, Petri and Marien on the right]]\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts.

The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War&nbsp;II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the [[Hellweg|Westen-/Ostenhellweg]], part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\n\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|title=Wiederaufbau - 20.

Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the [[second World War]], relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, [[Kreuzviertel]] forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life.

As the largest homogeneous old building area in [[Ruhr]] the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial [[urban area]] that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the [[Westfalenh\u00fctte]] steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtbezirke/stbzportal_innenstadtnord/leben_in_in//|title=Die Stadt im Wiederaufbau|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\n\nThe area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html// |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330025233/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the [[Expo 2000]] in Hanover.

In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\n\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n====Unionviertel====\n[[File:Unionviertel Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Rheinische Stra\u00dfe]]\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-c-c-e.de/kreativquartiere-ruhr.html|title=ecce - european centre for creative economy: Kreativ.Quartiere Ruhr|website=www.e-c-c-e.de}}</ref>\n\n====H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix====\n[[File:Phoenixsee Dortmund, Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Lake Phoenix]]\n[[File:Dortmund Hoerde Hoerder Burg 05.jpg|thumb|H\u00f6rde castle]]\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of [[Herdecke]], [[Witten]], [[Bochum]], [[Castrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Unna]] und [[Schwerte]]. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the [[Emscher]] and Lake Phoenix.\n\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in [[Europe]]. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of [[ThyssenKrupp]] newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund.

Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\n\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\n*[[Zalando]]\n*[[HSBC Trinkaus]]\n*[[German Handball Association]]\n*[[Handball-Bundesliga|Handball-Bundesliga (HBL)]]\n*[[German public bank|Academy of the German public Bank]]\n*[[Mircosonic]]\n\nThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title=Phoenix-See - Leisure & Culture - dortmund.de|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\nThe River [[Emscher]] flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake.

The [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the [[Ruhr Area]]. It crosses the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-German border as a continuation of the Dutch [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] and crosses the [[Rhine]], leads through the [[Ruhr valley]] toward [[Bochum]], becoming B&nbsp;1 ([[Bundesstra\u00dfe 1|Bundesstra\u00dfe&nbsp;1]]) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A&nbsp;44 near [[Holzwickede]]. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to ''Der Spiegel'', it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\n\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the [[Kamener Kreuz]] interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] to the west these form the [[Dortmund Beltway]] (''Dortmunder Autobahnring'').\n\n===Cycling===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a [[Bike freeway]] called the ''Radschnellweg Ruhr'' (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n===Rail transport===\n[[File:HBFDo.JPG|thumb|Dortmund central railway station]]\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\nThe central train station ([[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Dortmund with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Berlin]] and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive [[Dortmund Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and bus system. The U-Bahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of [[L\u00fcnen]] in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last [[tram]]s on the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|title=Neuer U-Bahn-Tunnel: keine Stra\u00dfenbahn mehr in Dortmunder City|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Oliver Volmerich|date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092307/http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|archive-date=14 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system.

The houses were designed by architect Richard Owens and built by Welsh workers to house immigrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks.\n\n[[The Beatles]] drummer [[Ringo Starr]] was born in Madryn Street, before moving at age 4, and the house is now a popular tourist attraction. Although some houses were lost in [[Liverpool Blitz|World War II bombing]] and rebuilt, albeit to a different architectural style, many of the terraced properties in the original street configuration remain in the present day.\n\nFollowing a period of decline{{clarify}} in the late 20th century, plans were announced in the early 2000s as part of the [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]] programme to demolish the estate and build new, but fewer, houses in their place. Despite the area being cleared of residents and houses prepared for demolition at a cost to the council{{clarify}} of nearly \u00a322 million, funding was withdrawn in 2011 following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|change in government]] and the demolition never happened.\n\nSubsequent revised demolition and renewal proposals by the council and housing group Plus Dane were rejected by the Government on the grounds of the effect it would have on cultural heritage. Instead, a housing renewal company took ownership of some of the properties, initially in a pilot scheme, to extensively renovate them and make them available for rent. The first tenants moved into Voelas Street around September 2017. Place First, the company renovating the properties, won an award in November 2018 for the standard of the refurbishments.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Welsh Streets Liverpool OSM.png|thumb|160px|right|OpenStreetMap of the Welsh Streets region]]\nThe streets include Wynnstay Street, Voelas Street, [[Rhiwlas, Powys|Rhiwlas]] Street, [[Powys|Powis]] Street, Madryn Street, [[Kinmel Bay|Kinmel]] Street, Gwydir Street, [[Pengwern]] Street and Treborth Street.

A survey in 2003 found that 72% of respondants were at least satisfied with their home and over half were at least satisfied with the quality of housing in the area, whilst only 1% believed demolition would improve the area. The renewal programme's proposals were to demolish 500 Victorian terraced houses and replace with 370 new build houses, with a smaller scale refurbishment elsewhere.{{sfn|Chitty|2016|p=198}} When the plans were submitted, over half of the properties were under [[Housing association|social landlord]] control.

Homes acquired by the council were reduced in value by 20% each year to allow transfer to the council's preferred development partner for a nominal sum, whilst still being within the legal parameters for achieving fair market value.

The cost was estimated to be in the region of \u00a315 million which would have seen the demolition of houses from the other surrounding Welsh Streets to be replaced with semi-detached properties. The managing director of the proposed regeneration, Claire Griffiths, suggested that 70% of residents had favoured the plans, yet housing charity Empty Homes disputed the credibility of the public opinion report, given the criteria used would have made it difficult to conclude refurbishment as a favourable option.<ref name=\"echo_plan15mil_feb13\">{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/15m-plans-liverpools-welsh-streets-3322999 |title=\u00a315m plans for Liverpool\u2019s Welsh Streets unveiled |work=Liverpool Echo |date=21 February 2013 |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> Joe Anderson wrote a letter to Eric Pickles in July 2013, submitting his approved view on the proposed redevelopment, suggesting the decision should in fact be a local matter and believed the scale of the proposal was \"not of national importance\", whilst suggesting there were \"no design or heritage issues arising\".<ref name=\"welshsreets_reps_doc1\"/>\n\nThe plans ultimately fell through when in January 2015 following a [[public inquiry]], Eric Pickles halted the demolition plans, with specific focus on Madryn Street stating that \"the demolition of much of Madryn Street will significantly harm the ability to understand and appreciate this part of Liverpool\u2019s Beatles heritage.\" Pickles further disputed that the streets were of low significance, believing that the proposals would be harmful to what he perceived as a heritage asset.{{sfn|Pitt|2015|p=3}} Pickles agreed with the argument put forward by SAVE and the National Trust, specifically in relation to Madryn Street, in that demolition of much of the street, together with the wider Welsh Streets region would \"significantly harm the ability to understand and appreciate this part of Liverpool's Beatles heritage\", citing the potential impact for future tourism if the proposals had been accepted. Although the streets had not been designated as a heritage asset, Eric Pickles believed the proposals would be significantly harmful to cultural heritage and have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the nearby Princes Park, directly contrasting the view of an inspector who had previously concluded the streets were of low significance to the heritage of Liverpool.<ref name=\"planning_application_conclusion\">{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/395694/15-01-15_DL_IR_Welsh_Street_Liverpool_2206519.pdf |title=Application by Plus Dane Group at Princes Park, the Welsh Streets, Liverpool L8 |publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government |date=15 January 2015 |access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Refurbishment==\n[[File:Voelas Street 201709.jpg|thumb|Voelas Street in September 2017, showing almost complete refurbishment]]\nWith few alternate options, refurbishment was deemed viable by the council.

The houses were designed by architect Richard Owens and built by Welsh workers to house immigrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks.\n\n[[The Beatles]] drummer [[Ringo Starr]] was born in Madryn Street, before moving at age 4, and the house is now a popular tourist attraction. Although some houses were lost in [[Liverpool Blitz|World War II bombing]] and rebuilt, albeit to a different architectural style, many of the terraced properties in the original street configuration remain in the present day.\n\nFollowing a period of decline{{clarify}} in the late 20th century, plans were announced in the early 2000s as part of the [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]] programme to demolish the estate and build new, but fewer, houses in their place. Despite the area being cleared of residents and houses prepared for demolition at a cost to the council{{clarify}} of nearly \u00a322 million, funding was withdrawn in 2011 following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|change in government]] and the demolition never happened.\n\nSubsequent revised demolition and renewal proposals by the council and housing group Plus Dane were rejected by the Government on the grounds of the effect it would have on cultural heritage. Instead, a housing renewal company took ownership of some of the properties, initially in a pilot scheme, to extensively renovate them and make them available for rent.

To solidify this, Federal President [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]] was received by Gorbachev in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] on 7 July 1987 to discuss the visit. The announcement of the [[abolition of capital punishment]] in the GDR on 17 July 1987 by the State Council was also related to Honecker's planned visit.<ref name=\"HoneckerBesuchinderBRD\" />\n\n==Meetings and ceremonies==\n===7 September===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0907-033, Bonn, Besuch Erich Honecker.jpg|thumb|The dinner on 7 September.

The differing views on the significance of Honecker's visit gave diplomatic protocol services particular challenges. While the political leadership of the GDR expected that Honecker would receive customary diplomatic practices in accordance with the internationally recognized institutions, the West Germans tried to avoid such a protocol which would be considered a recognition of the GDR as an independent state and an endorsement of the communist system.<ref name=\"HoneckerBesuchinderBRD\" /><ref name=\"25JahreHoneckerBesuch\">[http://www.n24.de/n24/Wissen/History/d/1610694/als-bonn-die--spalterflagge--setzte.html ''25 Jahre Honecker-Besuch: Als Bonn die \u201eSpalterflagge\u201c setzte.''] Zugriff am 11.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]] on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy Vs. The Real World\". The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment Part 1\".\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics\u2014including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\"\u2014have been released through various internet outlets.\n\n===Only-series (1999\u20132002)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#7ea6e2\n|overall=\n|title=25\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Pilot (or The Douchebag Aspect)\n|DirectedBy = [[Lauren MacMullan]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Bill Oakley]] & [[Josh Weinstein]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|9|24}}\n|ProdCode = 3950-01\n|ShortSummary = Andy French, an aspiring cartoonist working at a waterbed store run by a sleazy, ambiguously Eastern European man named Ron, is forced to take in his annoying little brother, Kevin, after Andy's parents decide to move away to Wyoming and not take Kevin with them.\n''Music'': \"Burning Flies\" by [[Looper (band)|Looper]], \"Couldn't You Wait\" (Acoustic Version) by [[Silkworm (band)|Silkworm]], \"Don't Let the Bastards Grind You Down\" by [[The Toasters]], \"Rude Boy Rock\" by [[Lionrock]]\n| LineColor = 7ea6e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Andy Joins the PTA (or Great Sexpectations)\n|DirectedBy = Gary McCarver\n|WrittenBy = [[Andrew Kreisberg]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|26}} <small>(on [[Adult Swim]])</small>\n|ProdCode = 3950-02\n|ShortSummary = When Andy attends Kevin's parent-teacher conference en lieu of their mother and father, he joins the PTA in order to impress Kevin's English teacher.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
