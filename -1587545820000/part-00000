On his first day at his new school, he meets a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto. Chizuru asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she tells him that she is in love with him and accidentally reveals to him that she is in fact a [[kitsune|fox spirit]]. Chizuru constantly and openly flirts with Kouta, even in front of others, embarrassing him greatly. Soon after the story begins, a wolf spirit named Nozomu Ezomori transfers into Kouta's school and class. From day one, she is all over Kouta, serving to embarrass him more and causing Chizuru to become annoyed at her new competition for Kouta's affection.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Kouta Oyamada|\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u8015\u592a|Oyamada K\u014dta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118161848/http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|title=Staff & Cast|publisher=www.kanokon.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\n:Kouta is the protagonist of the story.

He is initially reluctant to engage in the \"intimate\" acts Chizuru desires, but does so later on in the series citing her inspiration. Kouta's true bond with Chizuru is shown when they fuse into a powerful being that gives Kouta black fox ears with tails. According to Chizuru's brother Tayura, this possession can only happen if a human and a [[y\u014dkai]] share a deep emotional bond with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kanokon Omnibus 1-2|author=Katsumi Nishino|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|date=April 16, 2013|chapter=1|pages=79-80|ISBN=978-1-9378-6735-5}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chizuru Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5343\u9db4|Minamoto Chizuru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tower.com/kanokon-girl-who-cried-fox-tv-ova-collection-n-a-dvd/wapi/122152628|title=DVD: Kanokon: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection (DVD) with Ayako Kawasumi, Dorothy Elias-Fahn, Mamiko Noto, Mona Marshall|author=|date=|work=Tower.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n:Chizuru is second-year female student at Kouta's school. On the outside she appears to be a well endowed teenage girl, but she is in fact a powerful [[kitsune]]. When she changes form, her black hair turns blonde, and she gains fox ears and a tail. While it is implied by her brother Tayura that she is 400 years old, it is later revealed that her age may be in the thousands. She has no recollection of her past from before she met her foster mother Tamamo, but over time remembers some things she had forgotten about herself. From the start of the series she has fallen in love with Kouta, and is constantly hanging around him. She very much wants to enter into a \"relationship of sin\" with him and is very forthright in her almost constant sexual suggestions and actions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nozomu Ezomori|\u72b9\u5b88 \u671b|Ezomori Nozomu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Miy\u016b Takeuchi<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|May Kao}}\n:Nozomu is a first-year female transfer student at Kouta's school.

Like his sister, he is also a [[Kitsune|fox spirit]] but was adopted into her family. He frequently teases Chizuru about her age which results in her getting visibly annoyed. Initially Tayura was jealous of the relationship between his sister and Kouta prompting Chizuru to say that he is suffering from a [[Complex (psychology)|sister complex]]. He ends up falling in love with Akane but whenever he tries to get closer to her, he is given the cold shoulder.

Due to her position as [[Class president|class representative]] she has a high sense of regulations, and therefore disagrees with how ardently Chizuru pursues Kouta while at school.

The girls are nearly identical except for their slightly different hair styles.

On his first day at his new school, he meets a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto. Chizuru asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she tells him that she is in love with him and accidentally reveals to him that she is in fact a [[kitsune|fox spirit]]. Chizuru constantly and openly flirts with Kouta, even in front of others, embarrassing him greatly. Soon after the story begins, a wolf spirit named Nozomu Ezomori transfers into Kouta's school and class. From day one, she is all over Kouta, serving to embarrass him more and causing Chizuru to become annoyed at her new competition for Kouta's affection.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Kouta Oyamada|\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u8015\u592a|Oyamada K\u014dta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118161848/http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|title=Staff & Cast|publisher=www.kanokon.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\n:Kouta is the protagonist of the story.

He is initially reluctant to engage in the \"intimate\" acts Chizuru desires, but does so later on in the series citing her inspiration. Kouta's true bond with Chizuru is shown when they fuse into a powerful being that gives Kouta black fox ears with tails. According to Chizuru's brother Tayura, this possession can only happen if a human and a [[y\u014dkai]] share a deep emotional bond with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kanokon Omnibus 1-2|author=Katsumi Nishino|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|date=April 16, 2013|chapter=1|pages=79-80|ISBN=978-1-9378-6735-5}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chizuru Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5343\u9db4|Minamoto Chizuru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tower.com/kanokon-girl-who-cried-fox-tv-ova-collection-n-a-dvd/wapi/122152628|title=DVD: Kanokon: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection (DVD) with Ayako Kawasumi, Dorothy Elias-Fahn, Mamiko Noto, Mona Marshall|author=|date=|work=Tower.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n:Chizuru is second-year female student at Kouta's school. On the outside she appears to be a well endowed teenage girl, but she is in fact a powerful [[kitsune]]. When she changes form, her black hair turns blonde, and she gains fox ears and a tail. While it is implied by her brother Tayura that she is 400 years old, it is later revealed that her age may be in the thousands. She has no recollection of her past from before she met her foster mother Tamamo, but over time remembers some things she had forgotten about herself. From the start of the series she has fallen in love with Kouta, and is constantly hanging around him. She very much wants to enter into a \"relationship of sin\" with him and is very forthright in her almost constant sexual suggestions and actions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nozomu Ezomori|\u72b9\u5b88 \u671b|Ezomori Nozomu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Miy\u016b Takeuchi<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|May Kao}}\n:Nozomu is a first-year female transfer student at Kouta's school. She has short light ash blonde hair and is in fact a 200-year-old wolf spirit who lives by herself in an expensive but empty [[penthouse apartment]], where she always sleeps naked on the floor.

They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in Bangladesh along with [[Rockstrata]]. Multiple changes have taken place in membership since its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums.\n\nThe band has experimented with different subgenres of hard rock and heavy metal over the years like progressive metal. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s adapting the styles of fast [[arpeggios]], [[sweep picking]], [[tapping]] led the band's sound into [[neoclassical metal]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferdous |first=Fahim |date=23 December 2017 |title='It's not worth dying on stage' |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/its-not-worth-dying-stage-1508878 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== First decade and breakthrough \u2013 \"Warfaze\" and \"\u0985\u09ac\u09be\u0995 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09cb\u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be (Astonishing Love)\" (1984\u201394) ===\n\nThe first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having to leave the band for personal reasons. The band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back then.<ref name=\"Warfaze Biography\">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Biography|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/warfaze/|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1985, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] took up lead guitar duties for the band at this stage and the rest of the positions were filled with Babna Karim as the bassist, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as drummer, and e\nReshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman and Fuad of In Dhaka volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal duties and Sazzadwas recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist. All the while, Tipu held the band together and recruited the services of C\u00e9zanne, bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]]. Later Balam departed to pursue a solo career as a commercial pop artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Balam|url=http://banglamusic.com/interviews/interview-with-balam-403.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nKamal rejoined the band in 2007 and recruited Oni Hasan of the band Vibe, resulting in a major change in their sound, with [[neoclassical metal]] influences especially in live performances.

[[Bangladeshi heavy metal]] band formed in 1984 in [[Dhaka]] by guitarist [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]. They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in Bangladesh along with [[Rockstrata]]. Multiple changes have taken place in membership since its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums.\n\nThe band has experimented with different subgenres of hard rock and heavy metal over the years like progressive metal. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s adapting the styles of fast [[arpeggios]], [[sweep picking]], [[tapping]] led the band's sound into [[neoclassical metal]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferdous |first=Fahim |date=23 December 2017 |title='It's not worth dying on stage' |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/its-not-worth-dying-stage-1508878 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== First decade and breakthrough \u2013 \"Warfaze\" and \"\u0985\u09ac\u09be\u0995 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09cb\u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be (Astonishing Love)\" (1984\u201394) ===\n\nThe first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having to leave the band for personal reasons. The band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back then.<ref name=\"Warfaze Biography\">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Biography|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/warfaze/|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1985, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] took up lead guitar duties for the band at this stage and the rest of the positions were filled with Babna Karim as the bassist, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as drummer, and e\nReshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman and Fuad of In Dhaka volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

This line-up released the album ''[[Aalo (album)|\u0986\u09b2\u09cb (Light)]]'' in 2001.\n\nHowever, 2002 saw marked changes in the line-up once again with Mizan leaving the band for personal reasons and Kamal taking a break after almost 20 years of continued activity. Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal duties and Sazzadwas recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist. All the while, Tipu held the band together and recruited the services of C\u00e9zanne, bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]]. Later Balam departed to pursue a solo career as a commercial pop artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Balam|url=http://banglamusic.com/interviews/interview-with-balam-403.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nKamal rejoined the band in 2007 and recruited Oni Hasan of the band Vibe, resulting in a major change in their sound, with [[neoclassical metal]] influences especially in live performances.

In 1885, he began work at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under the renowned botanist [[Anton de Bary]]; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria.\n\nIn 1888, he relocated to [[Zurich]], where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrifying bacteria|Nitrosococcus]]'', which oxidizes [[ammonium]] to [[nitrite]], and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', which oxidizes nitrite to [[nitrate]].\n\nHe returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891\u20131905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine. During this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'', which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In St. Petersburg, he trained his only student und assistant [[Vasily Leonidovitch Omelianski|Vasily Omelianski]] which popularized Winogradskys concepts and methodology in the [[Soviet Union]] during the next decades<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waksman|first=Selman A.|date=1928|title=PROFESSOR V.

In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the [[Pasteur Institute]] at an experimental station at [[Brie-Comte-Robert]], France, about 30&nbsp;km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, [[nitrogen fixation]] by ''[[Azotobacter]]'', [[cellulose]]-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953.\n\n==Discoveries==\nWinogradsky discovered various [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and parts of these cycles.

Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from [[light]], not from reactions of inorganic compounds.  With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: [[phototroph|photoautotrophs]] and chemoautotrophs.  Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of [[microbial ecology]] and [[environmental microbiology]].\n\nThe [[Winogradsky column]] remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.<ref name=\"brock\">{{Cite book\n| edition = 13th\n| publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]]\n| isbn = 9780321649638\n| last = Madigan\n| first = Michael T.\n| title = Brock biology of microorganisms\n| location = San Francisco\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hermann Hellriegel]]\n* [[Martinus Beijerinck]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Moshynets |first=O.  |contribution=From Winogradsky\u2019s column to contemporary research using bacterial microcosms. |others=Harris, C.C.

In this early stage of his life, Winogradsky was \"strictly devoted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church|orthodox faith]]\", though he later became irreligious.<ref>[[Selman Abraham Waksman|Waksman, Selman Abraham]]. 1953.

Rutgers University Press. p. 4</ref>\n\nHe entered the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Imperial Conservatoire of Music in St Petersburg]] in 1875 to study piano.<ref name=\"frs\"/> However, after two years of music training, he entered the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in 1877 to study chemistry under [[Menshutkin reaction|Nikolai Menshchutkin]] and botany under [[Andrei Famintsyn|Andrei Sergeevich Famintzin]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nHe received a diploma in 1881 and stayed at the [[St. Petersburg University]] for a degree of master of science in botany in 1884. In 1885, he began work at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under the renowned botanist [[Anton de Bary]]; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria.\n\nIn 1888, he relocated to [[Zurich]], where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrifying bacteria|Nitrosococcus]]'', which oxidizes [[ammonium]] to [[nitrite]], and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', which oxidizes nitrite to [[nitrate]].\n\nHe returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891\u20131905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine; during this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'', which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nIn 1901, he was elected honorary member of the [[Moscow Society of Naturalists]] and, in 1902, corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].\n\nHe retired from active scientific work in 1905, dividing his time between his private estate and Switzerland. In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the [[Pasteur Institute]] at an experimental station at [[Brie-Comte-Robert]], France, about 30&nbsp;km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, [[nitrogen fixation]] by ''[[Azotobacter]]'', [[cellulose]]-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953.\n\n==Discoveries==\nWinogradsky discovered various [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and parts of these cycles. These discoveries include\n* His work on [[sulfur cycle|bacterial sulfide oxidation]] for which he first became renowned, including the first known form of [[lithotrophy]] (in [[Beggiatoa]]).\n* His work on the [[Nitrogen cycle]] including\n** The identification of the [[obligate anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'' is a free living microbe capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and not living in [[legume]] [[root nodule]]s.\n** Chemosynthesis \u2013 his most noted discovery\n** The [[Winogradsky column]]<ref>{{cite book | last1=Ogunseitan |first1= Oladele | title= Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes| year= 2005 | edition=1st |publisher= Wiley| url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405144483.html| isbn= 978-1-4051-4448-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|350px|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]\n\n===Chemosynthesis===\nWinogradsky is best known for discovering chemoautotrophy, which soon became popularly known as [[chemosynthesis]], the process by which organisms derive energy from a number of different [[inorganic compound]]s and obtain [[carbon]] in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]. Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from [[light]], not from reactions of inorganic compounds.  With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: [[phototroph|photoautotrophs]] and chemoautotrophs.  Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of [[microbial ecology]] and [[environmental microbiology]].\n\nThe [[Winogradsky column]] remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.<ref name=\"brock\">{{Cite book\n| edition = 13th\n| publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]]\n| isbn = 9780321649638\n| last = Madigan\n| first = Michael T.\n| title = Brock biology of microorganisms\n| location = San Francisco\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hermann Hellriegel]]\n* [[Martinus Beijerinck]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Moshynets |first=O.  |contribution=From Winogradsky\u2019s column to contemporary research using bacterial microcosms. |others=Harris, C.C.

It is located in the old town of Gandara ''(Brgy. Bangahon)''. The said church was ruined during the Pulajanes-American battle. The church was noted for its Bangahon bell ''(Lingganay).'' This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at Balangiga. The bell of Bangahon church is believed to be one of those [[Balangiga bells]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://174.127.109.64/en/Map-Gandara_1418306.html|title=Map - Gandara,\u00a0Samar\u00a0(Gandara) - MAP[N]ALL.COM|website=174.127.109.64|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants.

Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes.
