That company, later renamed Firepower Systems, was backed by [[Canon Inc.]] and used technology developed at NeXT. It developed and built high-end systems using the PowerPC chip. [[Motorola]] bought the business in 1996.<ref name=\"Tekla\" /><ref>{{cite news | last=Hof | first=Robert | author2=Gross, Neil | author3=Sager, Ira | url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1994/b336138.arc.htm?campaign_id=search/ | title=A computer maker's power move | publisher=[[Business Week]] | date=March 7, 1994 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224185036/http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1994/b336138.arc.htm?campaign_id=search%2F | archivedate=December 24, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Apple Computer===\nAfter Apple's purchase of NeXT, Rubinstein had planned on an extended vacation to travel. But Jobs, now an unpaid consultant for Apple, invited Rubinstein to work with him for Apple.\n\nAt the time, Apple was losing industry support. The company's reputation as an innovator was waning, as were profits (Rubinstein's arrival in February 1997 came on the heels of a year in which Apple lost [[United States dollar|US$]]816 million). Rubinstein joined Apple anyway because, as he told ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Apple was the last innovative high-volume computer maker in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Markoff | first=John | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5D91F3AF935A15757C0A96F958260 | title=Apple and PC's, Both Given Up for Dead, Are Rising Anew | work=The New York Times | date=April 26, 1999}}</ref>\n\nRubinstein joined Apple as Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, and a member of its executive staff. He was responsible for hardware development, industrial design and low-level software development, and contributed heavily to Apple's technology roadmap and product strategy.\n\nRubinstein took on an immense workload upon his arrival. The company sold over 15 product lines, nearly all of which were derided as inferior to other computers available at the time. Internally, Apple also suffered from extreme mismanagement of its hardware teams. Multiple teams often worked on the same product independently of each other, and very little attention was directed towards making all of the product lines fully compatible with each other. With Jobs, Rubinstein helped towards fixing both of these problems.\n\nHe also helped initiate an extensive cost-cutting plan affecting research projects and engineers. Expenses were eventually cut in half. After critically examining all projects currently in the pipeline, the [[Power Macintosh G3|G3]], a fast PowerPC-based desktop machine, was chosen to be Apple's next released product. Upon its release at the end of 1997, Apple finally had what it hadn't had in years: a cutting-edge desktop machine that could compete with its [[Intel]]-based competitors.\n\nIn 1997, Jobs cancelled almost all of the product lines, and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level desktop computer suitable for consumers. The result was the [[iMac G3|iMac]] released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as [[USB]], which would then go on to become an [[Technical standard|industry standard]]. The iMac also shipped without a [[floppy disk]] drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as USB and Firewire for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.<ref name=engadget>{{cite web | title = The Engadget Show 001 | date=September 17, 2009 | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/the-engadget-show-001-jon-rubinstein-bit-shifter-ipod-event/}}</ref>\n\nFuture rollouts under Rubinstein's management included all subsequent upgrades (the [[Power Mac G4|G4]] and [[Power Mac G5|G5]]) of the Power Mac series. While they were technically powerful computers, the Power Mac series suffered from the perception that they were slower than their Intel-based counterparts because their PowerPC CPUs listed slower clock speeds. Rubinstein and Apple popularised a term known as the [[Megahertz myth]], to describe how the PowerPC architecture could not be compared to the Intel architecture simply on their clock speeds (the PowerPC CPUs, despite their lower clock speeds, were generally comparable to Intel CPUs of the era).<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Megahertz Myth (broken link)  | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]]  | url = http://www.asia.apple.com/g4/myth/  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020917014851/http://www.asia.apple.com/g4/myth/  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2002-09-17  }}</ref>\n\n====iPod development====\nDue to the relatively low sales of its Mac computer brand, Apple decided to expand its [[ecosystem]] in order to increase its consumer awareness.

But Jobs, now an unpaid consultant for Apple, invited Rubinstein to work with him for Apple.\n\nAt the time, Apple was losing industry support. The company's reputation as an innovator was waning, as were profits (Rubinstein's arrival in February 1997 came on the heels of a year in which Apple lost [[United States dollar|US$]]816 million). Rubinstein joined Apple anyway because, as he told ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Apple was the last innovative high-volume computer maker in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Markoff | first=John | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5D91F3AF935A15757C0A96F958260 | title=Apple and PC's, Both Given Up for Dead, Are Rising Anew | work=The New York Times | date=April 26, 1999}}</ref>\n\nRubinstein joined Apple as Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, and a member of its executive staff. He was responsible for hardware development, industrial design and low-level software development, and contributed heavily to Apple's technology roadmap and product strategy.\n\nRubinstein took on an immense workload upon his arrival. The company sold over 15 product lines, nearly all of which were derided as inferior to other computers available at the time. Internally, Apple also suffered from extreme mismanagement of its hardware teams. Multiple teams often worked on the same product independently of each other, and very little attention was directed towards making all of the product lines fully compatible with each other. With Jobs, Rubinstein helped towards fixing both of these problems.\n\nHe also helped initiate an extensive cost-cutting plan affecting research projects and engineers. Expenses were eventually cut in half. After critically examining all projects currently in the pipeline, the [[Power Macintosh G3|G3]], a fast PowerPC-based desktop machine, was chosen to be Apple's next released product. Upon its release at the end of 1997, Apple finally had what it hadn't had in years: a cutting-edge desktop machine that could compete with its [[Intel]]-based competitors.\n\nIn 1997, Jobs cancelled almost all of the product lines, and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level desktop computer suitable for consumers. The result was the [[iMac G3|iMac]] released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as [[USB]], which would then go on to become an [[Technical standard|industry standard]]. The iMac also shipped without a [[floppy disk]] drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as USB and Firewire for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.<ref name=engadget>{{cite web | title = The Engadget Show 001 | date=September 17, 2009 | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/the-engadget-show-001-jon-rubinstein-bit-shifter-ipod-event/}}</ref>\n\nFuture rollouts under Rubinstein's management included all subsequent upgrades (the [[Power Mac G4|G4]] and [[Power Mac G5|G5]]) of the Power Mac series. While they were technically powerful computers, the Power Mac series suffered from the perception that they were slower than their Intel-based counterparts because their PowerPC CPUs listed slower clock speeds. Rubinstein and Apple popularised a term known as the [[Megahertz myth]], to describe how the PowerPC architecture could not be compared to the Intel architecture simply on their clock speeds (the PowerPC CPUs, despite their lower clock speeds, were generally comparable to Intel CPUs of the era).<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Megahertz Myth (broken link)  | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]]  | url = http://www.asia.apple.com/g4/myth/  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020917014851/http://www.asia.apple.com/g4/myth/  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2002-09-17  }}</ref>\n\n====iPod development====\nDue to the relatively low sales of its Mac computer brand, Apple decided to expand its [[ecosystem]] in order to increase its consumer awareness.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

In 1932, Don Runorata enters the Gandor headquarters, looking for Dallas.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Firo and the Three Gandor Brothers Are Felled by Assassins' Bullets\n| TranslitTitle       = F\u012bro to Gand\u014dru Sanky\u014ddai wa Ky\u014ddan ni Taoreru\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30ed\u3068\u30ac\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u4e09\u5144\u5f1f\u306f\u51f6\u5f3e\u306b\u5012\u308c\u308b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2007|10|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rachel explains that she received her injuries rescuing Natalie, Mary, Nice, and Nick from the Lemures. In 1931, Jacuzzi searches for Nice alone. In 1930, the Gandors kill Dallas and his gang, rescuing Firo and Ennis. However, Dallas and his gang recover and kill the five of them. Maiza attempts to run and Szilard follows, only to be hit by a car driven by Isaac and Miria. Underneath the ''Pussyfoot'', Czeslaw believes what has happened to him is punishment for devouring Ferment, another immortal who tortured him. Isaac and Miria attempt to rescue him, but he discovers they are immortal after seeing a cut on Isaac's wrist instantly heal, and panics, thinking they mean to eat him. All three of them fall off of the train after Czeslaw frantically swats away Isaac's attempts to save him. On the train's roof, Claire ties Lua to a [[mail hook]], causing Ladd to jump off the train to save her, only to find Claire used a slip knot. Nice and Nick try to climb to the roof, but are confronted by Goose. Jacuzzi attacks and draws Goose away, allowing Nice and Nick to escape. Goose attacks Jacuzzi with a [[flamethrower]] while his men are stopped by the passengers in the dining car, who have stolen and armed themselves with the Lemures' guns. Isaac, Miria, and Czeslaw are momentarily rescued by Rachel, who grabs the rope Isaac has, but she is unable to hang on due to the weight and her injury. Claire takes the rope and, upon encountering Donny, instructs him to save them. In 1930, Szilard orders Ennis to kill Isaac and Miria while he cripples Maiza.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = Both the Immortals and Those Who Aren't Sing the Praises of Life Equally\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushisha mo S\u014d de nai Mono mo Hitoshinami ni Jinsei o \u014cka suru\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u6b7b\u8005\u3082\u305d\u3046\u3067\u306a\u3044\u8005\u3082\u3072\u3068\u3057\u306a\u307f\u306b\u4eba\u751f\u3092\u8b33\u6b4c\u3059\u308b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2007|11|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = In 1931, Claire proposes to Chane, instructing her to carve her answer into the roof and then jump into the upcoming river. Nice and Nick steal explosives from the luggage car and dump them into the river, after which Nick also jumps into the river to meet up with the rest of their gang, who are waiting to recover the explosives. A pool of blood appears on the roof, causing Jacuzzi and Goose to mistake it for the Rail Tracer and panic. In 1930, Ennis asks Isaac and Miria not to forget about her, and turns and attacks Szilard as he is about to devour Maiza. On the ''Pussyfoot'', Jacuzzi is able to push Goose off the train, causing the flamethrower's gas tank to explode when it hits the rails. Isaac and Miria attempt to protect Czeslaw from the blood, which actually turns out to be Czeslaw's blood returning to his immortal body. In 1930, Szilard incapacitates Ennis, intending to give her a slow and painful death, but Isaac and Miria defend her. Szilard then discovers that Firo, the Gandors, and the Martillos are still alive, having apparently consumed the elixir. Ennis tells Firo how to devour Szilard, and Firo attacks and successfully devours him. In 1931, Czeslaw attempts to devour Isaac, but Isaac and Miria tell him they will be his family, causing Czeslaw, who had decided after his torture at Ferment's hands that he could never trust anyone, to begin crying. In 1930, Firo, having acquired all of Szilard's knowledge, saves a dying Ennis, and asks for her name after introducing himself. A surprised Ennis tells him, but questions why he would ask, as he should already know, to which Firo responds by saying he wanted to hear her say it, causing Ennis to smile and blush and prompting cheers from the Martillos as well as Isaac and Miria.  In 1932, Luck reveals that he had Dallas cemented into a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River as punishment for killing the Gandor members while reclaiming the elixir. Eve allows Don Runorata to examine Dallas in his laboratory in exchange for rescuing him from the Hudson and giving her visiting rights. In 1931, the ''Pussyfoot'' arrives in New York. Isaac and Miria, having worried about forgetting to buy a souvenir for Ennis, present Czeslaw to Ennis as her new younger brother as Maiza and Czeslaw reconcile. In 1930, Ronny comments that he knew about the elixir, but did not stop anyone from drinking it. He believes that everyone will make the best of it, exactly what he expected from them in the first place. In 1931, Claire finds Chane's response, which states that she will wait for him forever in Manhattan. After musing that Manhattan is a big place and that she doesn't even know his name, he decides to find her after fulfilling his duties to the Gandor brothers. Finally, in 2001, Isaac and Miria realize that they haven't aged.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Graham Specter's Love and Peace\n| TranslitTitle       = Gurahamu Supekut\u0101 no Ai to Heiwa\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b0\u30e9\u30cf\u30e0\u30fb\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u611b\u3068\u5e73\u548c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{TableTBA|N/A}}{{#tag:ref|Episodes 14, 15 and 16 never aired and were originally released on the fifth, seventh and eighth DVDs, respectively.<ref name=\"JaDVDReleases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baccano.jp/release/dvd.html|title=Official Japanese ''Baccano!'' site&nbsp;\u2014 Release DVD|publisher=baccano.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}</ref>|group=nb|name=nb1}}\n| ShortSummary        = In 1932, [[List of Baccano! characters#Graham Specter|Graham Specter]], a mechanic, is outraged because someone seriously injured Ladd.

In 1932, Don Runorata enters the Gandor headquarters, looking for Dallas.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Firo and the Three Gandor Brothers Are Felled by Assassins' Bullets\n| TranslitTitle       = F\u012bro to Gand\u014dru Sanky\u014ddai wa Ky\u014ddan ni Taoreru\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30ed\u3068\u30ac\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u4e09\u5144\u5f1f\u306f\u51f6\u5f3e\u306b\u5012\u308c\u308b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2007|10|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rachel explains that she received her injuries rescuing Natalie, Mary, Nice, and Nick from the Lemures. In 1931, Jacuzzi searches for Nice alone. In 1930, the Gandors kill Dallas and his gang, rescuing Firo and Ennis. However, Dallas and his gang recover and kill the five of them. Maiza attempts to run and Szilard follows, only to be hit by a car driven by Isaac and Miria. Underneath the ''Pussyfoot'', Czeslaw believes what has happened to him is punishment for devouring Ferment, another immortal who tortured him. Isaac and Miria attempt to rescue him, but he discovers they are immortal after seeing a cut on Isaac's wrist instantly heal, and panics, thinking they mean to eat him. All three of them fall off of the train after Czeslaw frantically swats away Isaac's attempts to save him. On the train's roof, Claire ties Lua to a [[mail hook]], causing Ladd to jump off the train to save her, only to find Claire used a slip knot. Nice and Nick try to climb to the roof, but are confronted by Goose. Jacuzzi attacks and draws Goose away, allowing Nice and Nick to escape. Goose attacks Jacuzzi with a [[flamethrower]] while his men are stopped by the passengers in the dining car, who have stolen and armed themselves with the Lemures' guns. Isaac, Miria, and Czeslaw are momentarily rescued by Rachel, who grabs the rope Isaac has, but she is unable to hang on due to the weight and her injury. Claire takes the rope and, upon encountering Donny, instructs him to save them. In 1930, Szilard orders Ennis to kill Isaac and Miria while he cripples Maiza.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = Both the Immortals and Those Who Aren't Sing the Praises of Life Equally\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushisha mo S\u014d de nai Mono mo Hitoshinami ni Jinsei o \u014cka suru\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u6b7b\u8005\u3082\u305d\u3046\u3067\u306a\u3044\u8005\u3082\u3072\u3068\u3057\u306a\u307f\u306b\u4eba\u751f\u3092\u8b33\u6b4c\u3059\u308b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2007|11|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = In 1931, Claire proposes to Chane, instructing her to carve her answer into the roof and then jump into the upcoming river. Nice and Nick steal explosives from the luggage car and dump them into the river, after which Nick also jumps into the river to meet up with the rest of their gang, who are waiting to recover the explosives. A pool of blood appears on the roof, causing Jacuzzi and Goose to mistake it for the Rail Tracer and panic. In 1930, Ennis asks Isaac and Miria not to forget about her, and turns and attacks Szilard as he is about to devour Maiza. On the ''Pussyfoot'', Jacuzzi is able to push Goose off the train, causing the flamethrower's gas tank to explode when it hits the rails. Isaac and Miria attempt to protect Czeslaw from the blood, which actually turns out to be Czeslaw's blood returning to his immortal body. In 1930, Szilard incapacitates Ennis, intending to give her a slow and painful death, but Isaac and Miria defend her. Szilard then discovers that Firo, the Gandors, and the Martillos are still alive, having apparently consumed the elixir. Ennis tells Firo how to devour Szilard, and Firo attacks and successfully devours him. In 1931, Czeslaw attempts to devour Isaac, but Isaac and Miria tell him they will be his family, causing Czeslaw, who had decided after his torture at Ferment's hands that he could never trust anyone, to begin crying. In 1930, Firo, having acquired all of Szilard's knowledge, saves a dying Ennis, and asks for her name after introducing himself. A surprised Ennis tells him, but questions why he would ask, as he should already know, to which Firo responds by saying he wanted to hear her say it, causing Ennis to smile and blush and prompting cheers from the Martillos as well as Isaac and Miria.  In 1932, Luck reveals that he had Dallas cemented into a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River as punishment for killing the Gandor members while reclaiming the elixir. Eve allows Don Runorata to examine Dallas in his laboratory in exchange for rescuing him from the Hudson and giving her visiting rights. In 1931, the ''Pussyfoot'' arrives in New York. Isaac and Miria, having worried about forgetting to buy a souvenir for Ennis, present Czeslaw to Ennis as her new younger brother as Maiza and Czeslaw reconcile. In 1930, Ronny comments that he knew about the elixir, but did not stop anyone from drinking it. He believes that everyone will make the best of it, exactly what he expected from them in the first place. In 1931, Claire finds Chane's response, which states that she will wait for him forever in Manhattan. After musing that Manhattan is a big place and that she doesn't even know his name, he decides to find her after fulfilling his duties to the Gandor brothers. Finally, in 2001, Isaac and Miria realize that they haven't aged.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Graham Specter's Love and Peace\n| TranslitTitle       = Gurahamu Supekut\u0101 no Ai to Heiwa\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b0\u30e9\u30cf\u30e0\u30fb\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u611b\u3068\u5e73\u548c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{TableTBA|N/A}}{{#tag:ref|Episodes 14, 15 and 16 never aired and were originally released on the fifth, seventh and eighth DVDs, respectively.<ref name=\"JaDVDReleases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baccano.jp/release/dvd.html|title=Official Japanese ''Baccano!'' site&nbsp;\u2014 Release DVD|publisher=baccano.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}</ref>|group=nb|name=nb1}}\n| ShortSummary        = In 1932, [[List of Baccano! characters#Graham Specter|Graham Specter]], a mechanic, is outraged because someone seriously injured Ladd.

She wonders what Claire was thinking when he proposed, but it does not help her understand her situation. Chane goes out for a walk and is abducted by Graham, who believes her to be Eve. Graham sends Jacuzzi a note, instructing him to gather as much money as possible and then come to meet him alone. Once Jacuzzi arrives, he learns that Nice, their gang, and Claire followed him. However, no one recognizes Claire, so he introduces himself as the Rail Tracer, terrifying Jacuzzi. Claire confronts Chane and declares his love for her.
