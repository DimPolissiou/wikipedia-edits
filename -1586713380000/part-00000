He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |first=Anne|last=Peters|date=13 March 2015|language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2|lk=off}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between {{hands|15|lk=off}} and {{hands|15.1|lk=off}.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weighed {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to geld the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]]. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight [[Horse length|lengths]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline />  He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the [[Handicap (horse racing)|top weight]] of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />  Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />  Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation.

He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>{{efn|The Experimental Free Handicaps were an early version of the [[World's Best Racehorse Rankings]].

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline /> His first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=May 4, 1964}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref> For his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101\u2013103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=11 May 1964}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained.

Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=June 8, 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=June 15, 1964}}</ref> Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961.

Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2|lk=off}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between {{hands|15|lk=off}} and {{hands|15.1|lk=off}.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weighed {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to geld the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline />  He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the [[Handicap (horse racing)|top weight]] of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />  Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />  Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=May 4, 1964}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah.

He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail.

He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack  |first1=Joe|last1=Nichols|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>  On the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=11 May 1964}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref> With the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=May 25, 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=June 8, 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=June 15, 1964}}</ref> Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch.

Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. A reason readers feel comfortable calling the narrator a \"he,\" because poe wrote, \"You fancy me mad. Manmen know nothing.\"<ref></ref> However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong.

His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]].

Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family.

Another Soviet aircraft, a newly manufactured [[Su-9]] on a transit flight, also attempted to intercept Powers's U-2. The unarmed Su-9 was directed to ram the U-2, but missed because of the large differences in speed. (The Su-9 flew above Mach 1.1, while the U-2 flew at approximately Mach 0.6.)\n\nAs Powers flew near Kosulino in the Ural Region, three S-75 Dvinas were launched at his U-2, with the first one hitting the aircraft. \"What was left of the plane began spinning, only upside down, the nose pointing upward toward the sky, the tail down toward the ground.\" Powers was unable to activate the plane's self-destruct mechanism before he was thrown out of the plane after releasing the canopy and his seat belt. While descending under his parachute, Powers had time to scatter his escape map, and rid himself of part of his suicide device, a silver dollar coin suspended around his neck containing a poison-laced injection pin, though he kept the poison pin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dobbs |first1=Michael |title=Gary Powers Kept a Secret Diary With Him After He Was Captured by the Soviets |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/gary-powers-secret-diary-soviet-capture-180956939/#yilEojcaVQvIj9qc.99 |website=Smithsonian |language=en}}</ref> \"Yet I was still hopeful of escape.\"  He hit the ground hard, was immediately captured, and taken to [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka Prison]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|61\u201363, 67\u201371, 76}} Powers did note a second chute after landing on the ground, \"some distance away and very high, a lone red and white parachute\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|69, 148\u201349, 274, 278}}<ref name=Rich>{{Cite book |last=Rich |first=Ben |title=Skunk Works |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1994 |ISBN=0316743305 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr/page/162 162\u201363] |url=https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr/page/162 }}</ref>{{rp|159\u201360}}\n\n===Attempted deception by the U.S. government===\nWhen the U.S. government learned of Powers's disappearance over the Soviet Union, they lied that a \"weather plane\" had strayed off course after its pilot had \"difficulties with his oxygen equipment\".

He was hampered by information appearing in the western press. A KGB major stated \"there's no reason for you to withhold information. We'll find it out anyway. Your Press will give it to us.\"  However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a [[pseudonym]] of \"Collins\".  At the same time, he repeatedly stated the maximum altitude for the U-2 was {{convert|68,000|ft|km}}, significantly lower than its actual flight ceiling.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|xii, 78, 91, 128, 135, 137, 139, 145, 165\u201366, 256}}\n\n===Political consequence===\nThe incident set back talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. Powers's interrogations ended on June 30, and his solitary confinement ended on July 9. On August 17, 1960, his trial began for espionage before the military division of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Lieutenant General Borisoglebsky, Major General Vorobyev, and Major General Zakharov presided. Roman Rudenko acted as prosecutor in his capacity of [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]].  [[Mikhail I. Grinev]] served as Powers's defense counsel. In attendance were his parents and sister, and his wife Barbara and her mother. His father brought along his attorney Carl McAfee, while the CIA provided two additional attorneys.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|110, 114, 119\u201320, 142\u201343, 148, 157\u201358, 162, 188, 220}}\n\n===Conviction===\nOn August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage, \"a grave crime covered by Article 2 of the Soviet Union's law 'On Criminality Responsibility for State Crimes'\".  His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]]. The US Embassy \"News Bulletin\" stated, according to Powers, \"as far as the government was concerned, I had acted in accordance with the instructions given me and would receive my full salary while imprisoned\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|157\u201361}}\n\nHe was held in [[Vladimir Central Prison]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} east of Moscow, in building number 2 from September 9, 1960 until February 8, 1962. His cellmate was Zigurds Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161, a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Soviet prisoners there.

Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a ''cabin crew'', as distinguished from [[Aviator|pilots]] and [[Flight engineer|engineers]] in the [[cockpit]].\n\nThe German [[Heinrich Kubis]] was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grossman, Dan |url=http://www.airships.net/blog/worlds-first-flight-attendant |title=The First Flight Attendant: Heinrich Kubis, 1912 |work=Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins |date=July 9, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> Kubis first attended the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin ''[[LZ 10 Schwaben]].''

The term [[purser]] and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international [[United Kingdom|British]] maritime tradition (i.e. [[chief mate]]) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian [[United States Merchant Marine]] on which [[United States|US]] aviation is somewhat modelled. Due to [[Public international law|international conventions]] and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly [[Merchant Mariner's Document|documented]] by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall [[command hierarchy|rank]] and [[chain of command|command structure]] of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.\n\n[[Imperial Airways]] of the United Kingdom had \"cabin boys\" or \"stewards\"; in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/07/23/before-the-stewardess-the-steward-when-flight-attendants-were-men/|title=Before the Stewardess, the Steward: When Flight Attendants Were Men - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|website=thesocietypages.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on [[Ford Trimotor]] planes between [[Detroit]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. [[Western Airlines]] (1928) and [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger [[Fokker]] aircraft used in the [[Caribbean]] had stewards in the era of gambling trips to [[Havana, Cuba]] from [[Key West, Florida]]. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.\n\n[[File:Nelly Diener cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelly Diener]], the first air stewardess in Europe, in 1934.

However, this is starting to be phased out, in favor of advertising which emphasises the modernity of their fleet.\n\n==Unions==\nFlight attendant [[Trade union|unions]] were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions.<ref>From Skygirl to Flight Attendant, Women and the Making of a Union by Georgia Panter Nielsen, ILR Press/Cornell, Ithaca, New York (1982){{ISBN|978-0-87546-093-2}}</ref> Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as [[Sexism|sexist]] [[stereotype]]s and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy.

In 1964 United States President [[Lyndon B.

The EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant.

Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a ''cabin crew'', as distinguished from [[Aviator|pilots]] and [[Flight engineer|engineers]] in the [[cockpit]].\n\nThe German Heinrich Kubis was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grossman, Dan |url=http://www.airships.net/blog/worlds-first-flight-attendant |title=The First Flight Attendant: Heinrich Kubis, 1912 |work=Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins |date=July 9, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> Kubis first attended the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin ''[[LZ 10 Schwaben]].''

The term [[purser]] and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international [[United Kingdom|British]] maritime tradition (i.e. [[chief mate]]) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian [[United States Merchant Marine]] on which [[United States|US]] aviation is somewhat modelled. Due to [[Public international law|international conventions]] and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly [[Merchant Mariner's Document|documented]] by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall [[command hierarchy|rank]] and [[chain of command|command structure]] of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.\n\n[[Imperial Airways]] of the United Kingdom had \"cabin boys\" or \"stewards\"; in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/07/23/before-the-stewardess-the-steward-when-flight-attendants-were-men/|title=Before the Stewardess, the Steward: When Flight Attendants Were Men - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|website=thesocietypages.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on [[Ford Trimotor]] planes between [[Detroit]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. [[Western Airlines]] (1928) and [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger [[Fokker]] aircraft used in the [[Caribbean]] had stewards in the era of gambling trips to [[Havana, Cuba]] from [[Key West, Florida]]. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.\n\n[[File:Nelly Diener cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelly Diener]], the first air stewardess in Europe, in 1934.

Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called \"stewardesses\" or \"air hostesses\", on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the [[Great Depression]], led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by [[Trans-World Airlines|Transcontinental and Western Airlines]] in December 1935.<ref name=\"hostess\">\"The air hostess carries on\", ''The New York Times''.

A 1936 ''[[New York Times]]'' article described the requirements: <blockquote>The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite; weight 100 to 118 pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years. Add to that the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year, and you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health.<ref name=\"NYtimes\"/></blockquote>\n\nThree decades later, a 1966 ''New York Times'' classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements: <blockquote>A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children considered), 20 years of age (girls 19{{1/2}} may apply for future consideration). 5'2\" but no more than 5'9\", weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/us/63-years-flying-from-glamour-to-days-of-gray.html \"63 Years Flying, From Glamour to Days of Gray\"].

At that time, airlines believed that the exploitation of female sexuality would increase their profits; thus the uniforms of female flight attendants were often formfitting, complete with white gloves and high heels.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boris|first=Eileen|year=2006|title=Desirable Dress: Rosies, Sky Girls, and the Politics of Appearance|journal=International Labor and Working Class

During this briefing, they go over safety and emergency checklists, the locations and amounts of emergency equipment and other features specific to that aircraft type. Boarding particulars are verified, such as special needs passengers, small children travelling as unaccompanied or VIPs. Weather conditions are discussed including anticipated [[turbulence]]. Prior to each flight a safety check is conducted to ensure all equipment such as [[personal flotation device|life-vests]], [[Flashlight|torch]]es (flash lights) and firefighting equipment are on board, in the right quantity, and in proper condition. Any unserviceable or missing items must be reported and rectified prior to [[takeoff|take-off]]. They must monitor the [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] for any unusual smells or situations.

Emergency training includes [[rejected takeoff|rejected take-off]]s, [[emergency landing]]s, cardiac and in-flight medical situations, smoke in the cabin, fires, [[Cabin pressurization|depressurization]], on-board births and deaths, dangerous goods and spills in the cabin, emergency [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]s, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]s, and [[water landing]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[File:Germanwings - Service.jpg|thumb|Flight attendants for [[Germanwings]] performing in flight service duties]]\n\n===Chief Purser===\nThe Chief Purser (CP), also titled as In-flight Service Manager (ISM), Flight Service Manager (FSM), Customer Service Manager (CSM) or Cabin Service Director (CSD) is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants.  While not necessarily the most-senior crew members on a flight (in years of service to their respective carrier), Chief Pursers can have varying levels of \"in-flight\" or \"on board\" bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners.  To reach this position, a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant. Further training is mandatory, and Chief Pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role.\n\n===Purser===\nThe Purser is in charge of the cabin crew, in a specific section of a larger aircraft, or the whole aircraft itself (if the purser is the highest ranking). On board a larger aircraft, Pursers assist the Chief Purser in managing the cabin. Pursers are flight attendants or a related job, typically with an airline for several years prior to application for, and further training to become a purser, and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role.\n\n==Qualifications==\n\n===Training===\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n\nFlight attendants are normally trained in the [[airline hub|hub]] or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months, depending on the country and airline. The main focus of training is safety, and attendants will be checked out for each type of aircraft in which they work. One of the most elaborate training facilities was [[Breech Academy]], which [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) opened in 1969 in [[Overland Park, Kansas]]. Other airlines were to also send their attendants to the school. However, during the fare wars, the school's viability declined and it closed around 1988.\n\nSafety training includes, but is not limited to: emergency passenger evacuation management, use of evacuation slides/life rafts, in-flight [[firefighting]], [[first aid]], [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], [[defibrillation]], ditching/emergency landing procedures, [[Uncontrolled decompression|decompression emergencies]], [[crew resource management]], and security.\n\nIn the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] requires flight attendants on aircraft with 20 or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a ''Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency''. This is not considered to be the equivalent of an [[Pilot licensing and certification|airman certificate]] (license), although it is issued on the same card stock. It shows that a level of required training has been met. It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed (although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working), and is the attendant's personal property. It does have two ratings, Group 1 and Group 2 (listed on the certificate as \"Group I\" and \"Group II\"). Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft, ([[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] or [[turbojet]]), on which the holder has trained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/info/all_infos/media/2008/FACert.pdf |title=Flight Attendant Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency |publisher=faa.gov}}</ref>\n\nThere are also training schools, not affiliated with any particular airline, where students generally not only undergo generic, though otherwise practically identical, training to flight attendants employed by an airline, but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment. These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons, though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations. In some countries, such as [[France]], a [[Academic degree|degree]] is required, together with the ''[[Safety training certificate (France) (Flight attendant)|Certificat de Formation \u00e0 la S\u00e9curit\u00e9]]'' ([[Safety training certificate (France) (Flight attendant)|safety training certificate]]).<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/CFS_presentation-2.pdf Certificat de Formation \u00e0 la S\u00e9curit\u00e9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004002601/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/CFS_presentation-2.pdf |date=2012-10-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Multilingualism|Multilingual]] flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers.

But as the role of women in the air grew, and airline companies began to realise the [[publicity]] value of their female flight attendants, more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

However, this is starting to be phased out, in favor of advertising which emphasises the modernity of their fleet.\n\n==Unions==\nFlight attendant [[Trade union|unions]] were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions.<ref>From Skygirl to Flight Attendant, Women and the Making of a Union by Georgia Panter Nielsen, ILR Press/Cornell, Ithaca, New York (1982){{ISBN|978-0-87546-093-2}}</ref> Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as [[Sexism|sexist]] [[stereotype]]s and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy.
