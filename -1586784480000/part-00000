Day and his wife Kittie successfully farmed in Rock Island County for several years, and was active in local  politics, the local grange, and a local farmers insurance company. In 1881, they moved to [[Spink County, South Dakota|Spink County, Dakota Territory]]. There he organized a Farmer's organization and served on the County Grange.\n\nDay built up his farm about three miles south of [[Mellette, South Dakota|Mellette, Dakota Territory]], near the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]].  \n\n==Public service in Dakota Territory==\nIn 1884, Day ran unopposed on the Republican ticket for Territorial Councilman (roughly equivalent to a state senator) for the Sixth District of the Dakota Legislature. Winning handily, Day and J.H. Westover served as Dakota  6th District's Councilmen on the 16th Territorial Council, which met in the new capitol of Bismarck for 60 days in Jan-Mar 1885. \nTwo legislative proposals during the 16th Legislative Session are noteworthy: the aftermath of the so-called Spink County War, and Women's Suffrage.\n\nThe Spink County War was a dispute between Old Ashton and Redfield for the County Seat. On December 1884, after the November vote to move the county seat to Redfield, county records were taken at night from the Old Ashton County Courthouse and moved to Redfield. An armed confrontation between the men of Old Ashton and the men of Redfield ensued, while legal challenges were ongoing within the circuit court.
