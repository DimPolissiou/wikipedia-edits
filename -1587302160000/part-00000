In his profile on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go.<ref name=nydaily>{{Cite news|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/03/13/2008-03-13_concern_about_paul_newmans_health.html|title=Concern about Paul Newman's health|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref><!--<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/08/familyandrelationships5|title=It's an age-old quandary&nbsp;\u2013 why do men, like dogs, stray?|work=The Guardian|date=October 8, 2006|accessdate=July 23, 2008|location=London|first=Barbara|last=Ellen}}</ref> --> Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films ''[[Rachel, Rachel]]'' and ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds (film)|The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]''.\n\nIt has been reported that Newman had an affair in the late 1960s with actress Nancy Bacon, which lasted one and a half years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5262240/Paul-Newman-was-a-drunk-adulterer-according-to-new-book.html|title=Paul Newman was a drunk adulterer, according to new book|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Nikkhah|first=Roya|date=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/book-details-paul-newmans-charmed-and-charming-life/2469147/|title=Book details Paul Newman's charmed, and charming, 'Life'|work=USA Today|date=May 4, 2009}}</ref> This was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman's wife Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-assassination-of-saint-paul-26534532.html|title=The assassination of 'Saint Paul'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Palmer|first=Caitriona|date=May 9, 2009|access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nNewman was an ordained minister of the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref name=\"McClanahan2003\">{{cite book|first=Ed|last=McClanahan|title=Famous People I Have Known|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ePbpCwydsYC&pg=PA4|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-9069-X|page=4}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nNewman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the [[Westport Country Playhouse]]'s 2008 production of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |title=Citing Health, Newman Steps Down as Director of Westport's ''Of Mice and Men'' |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |magazine=[[Playbill]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629080101/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |archivedate=June 29, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2008, it was widely reported in the press that he had been diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and was receiving treatment for the condition at the [[Sloan-Kettering]] hospital in New York City.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23833842-5001026,00.html \"Paul Newman has cancer\"], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]], June 9, 2008.</ref> [[A.

In his profile on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go.<ref name=nydaily>{{Cite news|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/03/13/2008-03-13_concern_about_paul_newmans_health.html|title=Concern about Paul Newman's health|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref><!--<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/08/familyandrelationships5|title=It's an age-old quandary&nbsp;\u2013 why do men, like dogs, stray?|work=The Guardian|date=October 8, 2006|accessdate=July 23, 2008|location=London|first=Barbara|last=Ellen}}</ref> --> Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films ''[[Rachel, Rachel]]'' and ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds (film)|The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]''.\n\nIt has been reported that Newman had an affair in the late 1960s with actress Nancy Bacon, which lasted one and a half years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5262240/Paul-Newman-was-a-drunk-adulterer-according-to-new-book.html|title=Paul Newman was a drunk adulterer, according to new book|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Nikkhah|first=Roya|date=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/book-details-paul-newmans-charmed-and-charming-life/2469147/|title=Book details Paul Newman's charmed, and charming, 'Life'|work=USA Today|date=May 4, 2009}}</ref> This was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman's wife Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-assassination-of-saint-paul-26534532.html|title=The assassination of 'Saint Paul'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Palmer|first=Caitriona|date=May 9, 2009|access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nNewman was an ordained minister of the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref name=\"McClanahan2003\">{{cite book|first=Ed|last=McClanahan|title=Famous People I Have Known|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ePbpCwydsYC&pg=PA4|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-9069-X|page=4}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nNewman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the [[Westport Country Playhouse]]'s 2008 production of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |title=Citing Health, Newman Steps Down as Director of Westport's ''Of Mice and Men'' |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |magazine=[[Playbill]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629080101/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |archivedate=June 29, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2008, it was widely reported in the press that he had been diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and was receiving treatment for the condition at the [[Sloan-Kettering]] hospital in New York City.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23833842-5001026,00.html \"Paul Newman has cancer\"], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]], June 9, 2008.</ref> [[A.

{"title_page": "Ionization chamber", "text_new": "The '''ionization chamber''' is the simplest of all gas-filled radiation detectors, and is widely used for the detection and measurement of certain types of [[ionizing radiation]]; [[X-rays]], [[gamma ray]]s, and [[beta particle]]s. Conventionally, the term \"ionization chamber\" is used exclusively to describe those detectors which collect all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.<ref name=knoll>{{cite book |first=Glenn F |last=Knoll |title=Radiation detection and measurement |edition=3rd |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-07338-3}}</ref> It only uses the discrete charges created by each interaction between the incident radiation and the gas, and does not involve the gas multiplication mechanisms used by other radiation instruments, such as the [[Geiger counter]] or the [[proportional counter]].\n\nIon chambers have a good uniform response to radiation over a wide range of energies and are the preferred means of measuring high levels of gamma radiation. They are widely used in the nuclear power industry, research labs, radiography, radiobiology, and environmental monitoring.\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic diagram of parallel plate ion chamber, showing creation of ion pairs, and drift of ions due to electric field. Electrons typically drift 1000 times faster than positive ions due to their smaller mass.<ref name=knoll/>]]\n[[File:Detector regions.gif|thumb|300px|Plot of ion current against voltage for a wire cylinder gaseous radiation detector. The ion chamber uses the lowest usable detection region.]]\nAn ionization chamber measures the charge from the number of [[ion|ion pairs]] created within a gas caused by incident radiation.{{refn|group=nb|The medium considered in this article is gaseous, though it can be liquid or solid}} It consists of a gas-filled chamber with two [[electrodes]]; known as [[anode]] and [[cathode]]. The electrodes may be in the form of parallel plates (Parallel Plate Ionization Chambers: PPIC), or a cylinder arrangement with a coaxially located internal anode wire.\n\nA voltage potential is applied between the electrodes to create an electric field in the fill gas. When gas between the electrodes is ionized by incident [[ionizing radiation]], [[Ionization|ion-pairs]] are created and the resultant positive ions and dissociated electrons move to the electrodes of the opposite [[Chemical polarity|polarity]] under the influence of the electric field. This generates an ionization current which is measured by an [[electrometer]] circuit. The electrometer must be capable of measuring the very small output current which is in the region of [[femtoampere]]s to [[picoampere]]s, depending on the chamber design, radiation dose and applied voltage.\n\nEach ion pair created deposits or removes a small electric charge to or from an electrode, such that the accumulated charge is proportional to the number of ion pairs created, and hence the radiation dose. This continual generation of charge produces an ionization current, which is a measure of the total ionizing dose entering the chamber.\n\nThe electric field is sufficiently strong to enable the device to work continuously by mopping up all the ion pairs, preventing the [[plasma recombination|recombination]] of ion pairs which would diminish the ion current. This mode of operation is referred to as \"current\" mode, meaning that the output signal is a continuous current, and not a pulse output as in the cases of the [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]] or the proportional counter.<ref name=knoll/> Because the number of ion pairs produced is proportional to the energy of the incident radiation, this continuously measured current is proportional to the dose rate (energy deposited per unit time) in the ionization chamber.\n\nReferring to the accompanying ion pair collection graph, it can be seen that in the ion chamber operating region the charge of a collected ion pair is effectively constant over a range of applied voltage, as due to its relatively low electric field strength the ion chamber does not have any multiplication effect. This is in distinction to the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube or the proportional counter whereby secondary electrons, and ultimately multiple avalanches, greatly amplify the original ion-current charge.\n\n==Chamber types and construction==\nThe following chamber types are commonly used.\n\n===Free-air chamber===\nThis is a chamber freely open to atmosphere, where the fill gas is ambient air. The domestic [[smoke detector#Ionization|smoke detector]] is a good example of this, where a natural flow of air through the chamber is necessary so that smoke particles can be detected by the change in ion current. Other examples are applications where the ions are created outside the chamber but are carried in by a forced flow of air or gas.\n\n===Chamber pressure===\n\n====Vented chamber====\nThese chambers are normally cylindrical and operate at atmospheric pressure, but to prevent ingress of moisture a filter containing a [[desiccant]] is installed in the vent line.<ref name=radpro>Ion chambers - RSO magazine Vol.8 No.5, Paul R Steinmeyer. {{cite web |url=http://www.radpro.com/ION2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915030829/http://www.radpro.com/ION2.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 }}</ref> This is to stop moisture building up in the interior of the chamber, which would otherwise be introduced by the \"pump\" effect of changing atmospheric air pressure. These chambers have a cylindrical body made of aluminium or plastic a few millimetres thick. The material is selected to have an atomic number similar to that of air so that the wall is said to be \"air equivalent\" over a range of radiation beam energies.<ref name=knoll/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seco|first1=Joao|last2=Clasie|first2=Ben|last3=Partridge|first3=Mike|title=Review on the characteristics of radiation detectors for dosimetry and imaging|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|date=21 October 2014|volume=59|issue=20|pages=R303\u2013R347|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/59/20/R303|pmid=25229250|doi-access=free|bibcode=2014PMB....59R.303S}}</ref><ref name=Hill2014>{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Robin|last2=Healy|first2=Brendan|last3=Holloway|first3=Lois|last4=Kuncic|first4=Zdenka|last5=Thwaites|first5=David|last6=Baldock|first6=Clive|title=Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|date=21 March 2014|volume=59|issue=6|pages=R183\u2013R231|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/R183|pmid=24584183|bibcode=2014PMB....59R.183H}}</ref> This has the effect of ensuring the gas in the chamber is acting as though it were a portion of an infinitely large gas volume, and increases the accuracy by reducing interactions of gamma with the wall material. The higher the atomic number of the wall material, the greater the chance of interaction. The wall thickness is a trade-off between maintaining the air effect with a thicker wall, and increasing sensitivity by using a thinner wall. These chambers often have an end window made of material thin enough, such as mylar, so that [[beta particles]] can enter the gas volume. Gamma radiation enters both through the end window and the side walls. For hand-held instruments the wall thickness is made as uniform as possible to reduce photon directionality though any beta window response is obviously highly directional. Vented chambers are susceptible to small changes in efficiency with air pressure <ref name=radpro/> and correction factors can be applied for very accurate measurement applications.\n\n====Sealed low pressure chamber====\nThese are similar in construction to the vented chamber but are sealed and operate at or around atmospheric pressure. They contain a special fill gas to improve detection efficiency as free electrons are easily captured in air-filled vented chambers by neutral oxygen which is [[electronegative]], to form negative ions. These chambers also have the advantage of not requiring a vent and desiccant. The beta end window limits the differential pressure from atmospheric pressure that can be tolerated, and common materials are stainless steel or titanium with a typical thickness of 25&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref>[http://www.lndinc.com/products/category/19/ LND Ion chamber specification sheets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102040120/http://www.lndinc.com/products/category/19/ |date=2012-11-02}}</ref>\n\n====High pressure chamber====\nThe efficiency of the chamber can be further increased by the use of a high pressure gas. Typically a pressure of 8-10 atmospheres can be used, and various noble gases are employed. The higher pressure results in a greater gas density and thereby a greater chance of collision with the fill gas and ion pair creation by incident radiation. Because of the increased wall thickness required to withstand this high pressure, only gamma radiation can be detected. These detectors are used in survey meters and for environmental monitoring.<ref name=radpro/>\n\n===Chamber shape===\n\n====Thimble chamber====\nMost commonly used for [[radiation therapy]] measurements is a cylindrical or \"thimble\" chamber. The active volume is housed within a thimble shaped cavity with an inner conductive surface (cathode) and a central anode. A bias voltage applied across the cavity collects ions and produces a current which can be measured with an electrometer.\n\n====Parallel-plate chambers====\nParallel-plate chambers are shaped like a small disc, with circular collecting electrodes separated by a small gap, typically 2mm or less. The upper disc is extremely thin, allowing for much more accurate near-surface dose measurements than are possible with a cylindrical chamber.\n\n====Monitor chambers====\nMonitor chambers are typically parallel plate ion chambers which are placed in radiation beams to continuously measure the beam's intensity. For example, within the head of [[linear accelerators]] used for [[radiotherapy]], multi-cavity ionization chambers can measure the intensity of the radiation beam in several different regions, providing beam symmetry and flatness information.\n\n===Research and calibration chambers===\n[[File:Ionisation chamber made by Pierre Curie, c 1895-1900. (9660571297).jpg|thumb|Ionization chamber made by Pierre Curie, c 1895-1900]]\nEarly versions of the ion chamber were used by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in their original work in isolating radioactive materials. Since then the ion chamber has been a widely used tool in the laboratory for research and calibration purposes. To do this a wide variety of bespoke chamber shapes, some using liquids as the ionized medium, have been evolved and used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ionization Chambers|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/ionchamber/ionizationchambers.htm|website=Health Physics Historical Instrumentation Collection|publisher=Oak Ridge Associated Universities|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> Ion chambers are used by national laboratories to calibrate primary standards, and also to transfer these standards to other calibration facilities.\n\n===Historical chambers===\n\n====Condenser chamber====\nThe condenser chamber has a secondary cavity within the stem which acts as a [[capacitor]]. When this capacitor is fully charged, any ionization within the thimble counteracts this charge, and the change in charge can be measured. They are only practical for beams with energy of 2 MeV or less, and high stem leakage makes them unsuited to precise dosimetry.\n\n====Extrapolation chamber====\nSimilar in design to a parallel plate chamber, the upper plate of an extrapolation chamber can be lower using micrometer screws. Measurements can be taken with different plate spacing and extrapolated to a plate spacing of zero, i.e. the dose without the chamber.\n\n==Instrument types==\n\n===Hand-held===\n[[File:RTG radiation measurement.jpg|thumb|300px|Hand-held integral ion chamber survey meter in use]]\n[[File:CivilDefenseVictoreen720 underside.jpg|thumb|View of sliding beta shield on integral hand held instrument]]\nIon chambers are widely used in [[survey meter|hand held radiation survey meters]] to measure beta and gamma radiation. They are particularly preferred for high dose rate measurements and for gamma radiation they give good accuracy for energies above 50-100 keV.<ref name=knoll/>\n\nThere are two basic configurations; the \"integral\" unit with the chamber and electronics in the same case, and the \"two-piece\" instrument which has a separate ion chamber probe attached to the electronics module by a flexible cable.\n\nThe chamber of the integral instrument is generally at the front of the case facing downwards, and for beta/gamma instruments there is a window in the bottom of the casing. This usually has a sliding shield which enables discrimination between gamma and beta radiation. The operator closes the shield to exclude beta, and can thereby calculate the rate of each radiation type.\n\nSome hand held instruments generate audible clicks similar to that produced by a G-M counter to assist operators, who use the audio feedback in radiation survey and contamination checks. As the ion chamber works in current mode, not pulse mode, this is synthesised from the radiation rate.\n\n===Installed===\nFor industrial process measurements and interlocks with sustained high radiation levels, the ion chamber is the preferred detector. In these applications only the chamber is situated in the measurement area, and the electronics are remotely situated to protect them from radiation and connected by a cable. Installed instruments can be used for measuring ambient gamma for personnel protection and normally sound an alarm above a preset rate, though the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube instrument is generally preferred where high levels of accuracy are not required.\n\n==General precautions in use==\nMoisture is the main problem that affects the accuracy of ion chambers. The chamber's internal volume must be kept completely dry, and the vented type uses a desiccant to help with this.<ref name=radpro/> Because of the very low currents generated, any stray leakage current must be kept to a minimum in order to preserve accuracy. Invisible hygroscopic moisture on the surface of cable dielectrics and connectors can be sufficient to cause a leakage current which will swamp any radiation-induced ion current. This requires scrupulous cleaning of the chamber, its terminations and cables, and subsequent drying in an oven. \"Guard rings\" are generally used as a design feature on higher voltage tubes to reduce leakage through or along the surface of tube connection insulators, which can require a resistance in the order of 10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;\u03a9.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=D.|last2=Sharpe|first2=J.|title=Nuclear particle and radiation detectors.

To overcome this a local converter module is often used to translate the very low ion chamber currents to a pulse train or data signal related to the incident radiation. These are immune to electromagnetic effects.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Nuclear industry===\nIonization chambers are widely used in the nuclear industry as they provide an output that is proportional to [[radiation dose]] They find wide use in situations where a constant high dose rate is being measured as they have a greater operating lifetime than standard Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tubes, which suffer from gas break down and are generally limited to a life of about 10<sup>11</sup> count events.<ref name=knoll/>\nAdditionally, the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube cannot operate above about 10<sup>4</sup> counts per second, due to dead-time effects, whereas there is no similar limitation on the ion chamber.\n\n===Smoke detectors===\nThe ionization chamber has found wide and beneficial use in [[smoke detector]]s. In an ionisation type smoke detector, ambient air is allowed to freely enter the ionization chamber. The chamber contains a small amount of [[americium-241]], which is an emitter of [[alpha particle]]s which produce a constant ion current. If [[smoke]] enters the detector, it disrupts this current because ions strike smoke particles and are neutralized. This drop in current triggers the alarm. The detector also has a reference chamber which is sealed but is ionized in the same way. Comparison of the ion currents in the two chambers allows compensation for changes due to air pressure, temperature, or the ageing of the source.\n\n===Medical radiation measurement===\n[[File:Dose Calibrator Diagram.png|thumb|354x354px|Diagram of a nuclear medicine dose calibrator or radionuclide calibrator that uses an ionization chamber.

The electrodes may be in the form of parallel plates (Parallel Plate Ionization Chambers: PPIC), or a cylinder arrangement with a coaxially located internal anode wire.\n\nA voltage potential is applied between the electrodes to create an electric field in the fill gas. When gas between the electrodes is ionized by incident [[ionizing radiation]], [[Ionization|ion-pairs]] are created and the resultant positive ions and dissociated electrons move to the electrodes of the opposite [[Chemical polarity|polarity]] under the influence of the electric field. This generates an ionization current which is measured by an [[electrometer]] circuit. The electrometer must be capable of measuring the very small output current which is in the region of [[femtoampere]]s to [[picoampere]]s, depending on the chamber design, radiation dose and applied voltage.\n\nEach ion pair created deposits or removes a small electric charge to or from an electrode, such that the accumulated charge is proportional to the number of ion pairs created, and hence the radiation dose. This continual generation of charge produces an ionization current, which is a measure of the total ionizing dose entering the chamber.\n\nThe electric field is sufficiently strong to enable the device to work continuously by mopping up all the ion pairs, preventing the [[plasma recombination|recombination]] of ion pairs which would diminish the ion current.

These are immune to electromagnetic effects.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Nuclear industry===\nIonization chambers are widely used in the nuclear industry as they provide an output that is proportional to [[radiation dose]] They find wide use in situations where a constant high dose rate is being measured as they have a greater operating lifetime than standard Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tubes, which suffer from gas break down and are generally limited to a life of about 10<sup>11</sup> count events.<ref name=knoll/>\nAdditionally, the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube cannot operate above about 10<sup>4</sup> counts per second, due to dead-time effects, whereas there is no similar limitation on the ion chamber.\n\n===Smoke detectors===\nThe ionization chamber has found wide and beneficial use in [[smoke detector]]s. In an ionisation type smoke detector, ambient air is allowed to freely enter the ionization chamber. The chamber contains a small amount of [[americium-241]], which is an emitter of [[alpha particle]]s which produce a constant ion current. If [[smoke]] enters the detector, it disrupts this current because ions strike smoke particles and are neutralized. This drop in current triggers the alarm. The detector also has a reference chamber which is sealed but is ionized in the same way. Comparison of the ion currents in the two chambers allows compensation for changes due to air pressure, temperature, or the ageing of the source.\n\n===Medical radiation measurement===\n[[File:Dose Calibrator Diagram.png|thumb|354x354px|Diagram of a nuclear medicine dose calibrator or radionuclide calibrator that uses an ionization chamber. The dipper is used to give a reproducible source position.]]\nIn [[medical physics]] and [[radiotherapy]], ionization chambers are used to ensure that the [[absorbed dose|dose]] delivered from a therapy unit<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hill |first1= R |last2= Mo |first2= Z |last3= Haque |first3= M |last4= Baldock |first4= C |year= 2009 |title= An evaluation of ionization chambers for the relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams |url= |journal= Medical Physics |volume= 36 |issue= 9Part1|pages= 3971\u20133981 |doi=10.1118/1.3183820|pmid= 19810470 | bibcode= 2009MedPh..36.3971H}}</ref> or [[radiopharmaceutical]] is what is intended.

His son interceded, on the ground that she neglected only him, but when they had no mother, all three sons would be neglected. His father relented, and the stepmother henceforth took care of all three children.

This can range from [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''Red as Blood'', where the stepmother queen is desperately trying to protect the land from her evil stepdaughter's magic, to [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', where, although it is known that stepmothers are evil, the actual stepmother is guilty of nothing more than some carelessness, to [[Erma Bombeck]]'s retelling where [[Cinderella]] is lazy and a liar. More subtly, [[Piers Anthony]] depicted the Princess Threnody as being cursed by her stepmother in ''[[Crewel Lye: A Caustic Yarn]]'': if she ever entered Castle Roogna, it would fall down. But Threnody explains that her presence at the castle caused her father to dote on her and neglect his duties to the destruction of the kingdom; her stepmother had merely made her destructive potential literal, and forced her to confront what she was doing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe character of the evil stepmother can also be found in the genre of [[young adult fiction]] or young adult social problem novels. In Lisa Heathfield's [[Paper Butterflies]]. the protagonist June suffers horrific abuse at the hands of her stepmother, a fact that she conceals from her father.\n\nDespite many examples of evil or cruel stepmothers, loving stepmothers also exist in fiction. In [[Kevin and Kell]], Kell is portrayed as loving her stepdaughter Lindesfarne, whom her husband Kevin had adopted during his previous marriage. Likewise, Lindesfarne considers Kell her mother, and has a considerably more favorable view of her than Angelique, Kevin's ex-wife and her adoptive mother, due to feeling neglected by Angelique during her childhood. The Disney film ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' also makes references to the \"evil stepmother\" belief, as the villainess is a stepmother, but her wickedness comes from her selfishness and power hungriness rather than the simple fact she is a stepmother. When a little girl tells the heroine Giselle that all stepmothers are evil, Giselle reminds her that she personally knows some wonderful women who were good stepmothers, and the fact a woman is a stepmother does not suddenly change her personality. This is shown later on when Giselle marries that girl's father, who had her from a previous marriage, thus becoming a stepmother herself. As Giselle is a sweet and caring woman, she makes a good wife and stepmother. However, it is notable that during much of that film, Giselle was more of an older sister figure than a maternal figure to that little girl.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'' a group of children worry that their father will remarry, believing from their fairy tales that all stepmothers are an \"evil breed.\" Although they help their father marry again to help keep the family together, their soon-to-be stepmother is very cruel, as they suspected. When the wedding to her is called off, the father decides to marry the much kinder scullery maid, causing one child to comment that the evil stepmother personification does not apply to her.\n\nStepmother relationships are often examined in [[soap opera]]s. An example of this is the long-running rivalry between [[Victoria Lord|Victoria Lord Banks]] and stepmother [[Dorian Lord]] on the American soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]''.\n\nIn contrast to many other [[Disney]]-related media, the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' features a stepfamily in which both parents get along well with their three children (avoiding the normal tropes of evil stepparents).<ref>http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art8292.asp</ref> In television, ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' features a stepfamily in which both parents usually get along well with their three children.  In the series ''[[The Adventures of Shirley Holmes]]'', one episode featured a princess who was the heir to the throne of her country and feared that her stepmother wanted to have her assassinated as her own son was next in line after her stepdaughter.  The episode concludes the revelation that her stepmother actually wanted her stepdaughter to inherit the throne and had attempted to thwart actual assassins who did not want a woman to rule their country.  In ''[[Sofia the First]]'', Sofia's mother Miranda became stepmother to Prince James and Princess Amber, she acknowledged there weren't many tales featuring loving and kind stepmothers. This is another example of a well-blended family.\n\n==Classical Literature==\n\n===Greek===\n\n====[[Alcestis | Alcestis (play)]]==== \n438 BCE: The dying biological mother requests that her husband not remarry, for fear of her children being mistreated by a stepmother.\n\n====[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]] ==== \n428 BCE: The stepmother commits suicide to prevent herself from following through on her lust for her stepson and leaves a note falsely claiming that the stepson had raped her.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Family}}\n\n[[Category:Stepfamily]]\n[[Category:Parenting]]\n[[Category:Terms for women]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Female stepparent}}\n\nA '''stepmother''' is the current wife of one's parent.

When the wedding to her is called off, the father decides to marry the much kinder scullery maid, causing one child to comment that the evil stepmother personification does not apply to her.\n\nStepmother relationships are often examined in [[soap opera]]s. An example of this is the long-running rivalry between [[Victoria Lord|Victoria Lord Banks]] and stepmother [[Dorian Lord]] on the American soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]''.\n\nIn contrast to many other [[Disney]]-related media, the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' features a stepfamily in which both parents get along well with their three children (avoiding the normal tropes of evil stepparents).<ref>http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art8292.asp</ref> In television, ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' features a stepfamily in which both parents usually get along well with their three children.  In the series ''[[The Adventures of Shirley Holmes]]'', one episode featured a princess who was the heir to the throne of her country and feared that her stepmother wanted to have her assassinated as her own son was next in line after her stepdaughter.  The episode concludes the revelation that her stepmother actually wanted her stepdaughter to inherit the throne and had attempted to thwart actual assassins who did not want a woman to rule their country.  In ''[[Sofia the First]]'', Sofia's mother Miranda became stepmother to Prince James and Princess Amber, she acknowledged there weren't many tales featuring loving and kind stepmothers. This is another example of a well-blended family.\n\n==Classical Literature==\n\n===Greek===\n\n====[[Alcestis | Alcestis (play)]]==== \n438 BCE: The dying biological mother requests that her husband not remarry, for fear of her children being mistreated by a stepmother.\n\n====[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]] ==== \n428 BCE: The stepmother commits suicide to prevent herself from following through on her lust for her stepson and leaves a note falsely claiming that the stepson had raped her.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Family}}\n\n[[Category:Stepfamily]]\n[[Category:Parenting]]\n[[Category:Terms for women]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepmother"}

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T.

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African American student to enroll at the College.

One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory.

It extends from {{bts|Forest Hills}} in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in the south to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] in the north.  It meets the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at {{bts|Downtown Crossing}}, the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] at {{bts|State}}, and the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] at {{bts|Haymarket}} and [[North Station]].  It connects with [[Amtrak]] service at {{bts|Back Bay}} and North Station, and with [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] service at Back Bay, North Station, Forest Hills, {{bts|Ruggles}} station in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and {{bts|Malden Center}} in Malden.  From 1901 to 1987, it provided the first elevated rapid transit in Boston; the [[Washington Street Elevated|last elevated section]] was torn down in 1987 when the southern portion of the line was moved to the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]].\n\nAll stations on the Orange Line are [[handicapped accessible]]. These stations are equipped with high-level platforms for easy boarding, as well as elevators for easy platform access.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the MBTA}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Charlestown El on Charlestown Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Charlestown El running over the Charlestown Bridge]]\nThe Main Line of the electric [[Boston Elevated Railway]] opened in segments, starting in 1901. It proceeded from [[Sullivan Square]] along the [[Charlestown Elevated]] to the [[Canal Street Incline]] near [[North Station]]. It was carried underground by the [[Tremont Street Subway]] (now part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]), returning above ground at the [[Pleasant Street Incline]] (now closed, located just south of [[Boylston station]]). A temporary link connected from there to the [[Washington Street Elevated]], which in 1901 ran from this point via Washington Street to Dudley Square (which is most of what is now Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]]).\n\nAlso in 1901, the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened, branching at Causeway Street to provide an alternate route through downtown Boston (along the shoreline, where today there is no rail transit) to the Washington Street Elevated.\n\nIn 1908, a new '''Washington Street Tunnel''' opened, allowing Main Line service to travel from the [[Charlestown Elevated]], underground via an additional new portal at the [[Canal Street Incline]], under downtown Boston and back up again to meet the Washington Street Elevated and Atlantic Avenue Elevated near [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. The stations wee richly decorated with tile work, mosaics, and copper; after criticism of the large [[Tremont Street Subway]] headhouses, most entrances were comparatively modest and set into buildings.<ref name=newboston>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Es9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Rapid Transit and Civic Beauty |magazine=New Boston |date=November 1910 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=307\u2013314 |first=Frederick W. |last=Coburn |via=Google Books}}</ref> Use of the parallel Tremont Street Subway was returned exclusively to [[streetcar]]s.\n\nBy 1909, the Washington Street Elevated had been extended south to {{bts|Forest Hills}}. Trains from Washington Street were routed through the new subway, either all the way to Sullivan Square, or back around in a loop via the subway and then the Atlantic Avenue Elevated.\n\nIn 1919, the same year that the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially damaged in Boston's [[Great Molasses Flood]], the Charlestown Elevated was extended north from Sullivan Square to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], over surface right-of-way parallel to [[Massachusetts Route 99|Alford Street/Broadway]], with a [[Movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Mystic River]].<ref name=netransit /> The Boston Elevated had long-term plans to continue this extension further north to [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], a goal which would only be achieved decades later, under [[MBTA|public ownership]] and not via the Everett route.\n\n===Closure of Atlantic Avenue Elevated and ownership changes===\n[[File:Rowes Wharf Station (13083218675).jpg|thumb|left|Rowes Wharf station on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1942 \u2013 four years after closure \u2013 just before being demolished]]\nFollowing a 1928 accident at a tight curve on Beach Street, the southern portion of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]], between South Station and Tower D on Washington Street, was closed (except for rush-hour trips from Dudley to North Station via the Elevated), breaking the loop; non-rush-hour Atlantic Avenue service was reduced to a shuttle between North and South Stations.<ref name=\"netransit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/MBTARouteHistory.pdf|title=Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district|last=Belcher|first=Jonathan|date=27 June 2015|format=PDF|publisher=NETransit|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>  In 1938, the remainder of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed, leaving the subway as the only route through downtown \u2013 what is now the Orange Line between {{bts|Haymarket}} and {{bts|Chinatown}} stations.\n\nOwnership of the railway was transferred from the private Boston Elevated Railway to the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947; the MTA was itself reconstituted as the modern [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) in 1964.\n\n===Orange Line naming===\n[[File:Tile mosaic at Boylston Street station, October 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Station sign at Boylston Street (now Chinatown) station in 1914.

Colors were assigned to the rail lines on August 26, 1965 as part of a wider modernization developed by [[Cambridge Seven Associates]]. [[Peter Chermayeff]] assigned [[Red Line (MBTA)|red]], [[Green Line (MBTA)|green]], and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|blue]] to the other three lines based on geographic features; however, according to Chermayeff, the Main Line El \"ended up being orange for no particular reason beyond color balance.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2018/09/how-boston-got-its-t/570004/ |title=How Boston Got Its \u2018T\u2019 |magazine=[[CityLab (web magazine)|CityLab]] |quote=I remember sitting in my Cambridge office preparing for a meeting with the MBTA in which I would be proposing colored lines.

One line went up the North Shore of Boston up to the coastal areas, so it seemed obvious to call that the Blue Line.

As a result of this review, the [[Charlestown Elevated]] \u2013 which served the [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] neighborhood north of downtown Boston and the inner suburb of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]] \u2013 was demolished and replaced in 1975.\n\nThe '''Haymarket North Extension''' rerouted the Orange Line through an [[Haymarket North Extension|underwater crossing]] of the [[Charles River]]. Service in Charlestown was replaced with service along [[Boston and Maine]] tracks routed partially beneath an elevated section of [[Interstate 93]], ultimately to {{bts|Wellington}} and then to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] instead of Everett. Rail service to Everett was replaced with buses.\n\n===Closure of Washington Street Elevated===\n[[File:ELEVATED RAILROAD STRUCTURE AND BLIGHTED AREA BELOW WASHINGTON STREET SOUTH FROM THE CORNER OF BARTLETT - NARA - 550012.tif|thumb|left|View under Washington Street Elevated, looking south from Bartlett Street (1973)]]\nConstruction of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] into downtown Boston was cancelled in 1972 after [[Freeway revolt|local protest]] over the necessary demolition.

After this re-routing was accomplished in 1987, the Washington Street Elevated was torn down, the last major segment of the original elevated line to be demolished.\n\n[[File:South Bay Tunnel junction HDR.JPG|thumb|right|The modern view from the platform at {{bts|Chinatown}} shows the remains of the Washington Street Tunnel that led to the Elevated in the distance.

On May 4, 1987, the Orange Line was rerouted from the southern end of the Washington Street Tunnel onto the new Southwest Corridor. Instead of rising up to elevated tracks, it now veered west at the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and followed the Pike and the old [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] right-of-way to the existing [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop at {{bts|Back Bay}}. It then continued along new tracks, partially covered and partially open but depressed, to {{bts|Forest Hills}}.

Originally, plans provided for [[light rail vehicle]]s [[street running]] in mixed traffic, from Washington Street to Dudley Square, then diverting southeastward on Warren Street towards Dorchester. In 2002, Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[bus rapid transit]] was added to connect Washington Street to the downtown subways, attempting to address this service need.

The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.)\n\nStarting in 2015, the MBTA began implementing its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] section of the Orange Line is located in a trench and is protected from the worst weather, but the 1970s-built [[Haymarket North Extension]] had older infrastructure and was in worse shape. From {{bts|Sullivan Square}} north, it is exposed to the weather and largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable.

These cars, known as 01100s, had been in service since the 1950s, and saw service on both the elevated and the northern extension before they were retired in 1981. Several remained on the property for some time before being scrapped. The 01100 cars were a favorite for fans, as the small motorman's cab enabled passengers to stand at the front for an operator's-eye view.\n\nThe Orange Line is [[standard gauge]] [[heavy rail]] and uses a [[third rail]] for power. The current fleet was built between 1979 and 1981 by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (now [[Alstom]]) of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada. They are 65 feet (20 m) long and 9&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (2.8 m) wide, with three pairs of doors on each side. They are based on the PA3 model used by [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] in [[New Jersey]] and the R44/R46/R62/R68 models used by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in [[New York City]] There are 120 cars, numbered 01200-01319.

The agency originally planned for a simultaneous order for 146 Orange Line cars (to replace the whole fleet) and 74 Red Line cars (to replace the older 1500 and 1600 series cars). A similar order was used in the late 1970s for the current Orange Line cars and the old Blue Line cars, ordered at the same time and largely identical except for size and color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctps.org/data/pdf/studies/transit/pmt/PMT_Ch5.pdf |title=CHAPTER 5: Priorities for Achieving a State of Good Repair |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=December 2009 |page=5-2 |work=The Program for Mass Transportation |author=Central Transportation Planning Staff}}</ref> In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would provide 152 new Orange Line cars to replace the existing 120-car fleet and add more frequent service.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=27773&month=&year= |title=Governor Patrick Announces Major Transportation Funding Investments |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2014, the MassDOT Board awarded a $566.6 million contract to a [[China]] based manufacturer [[China CNR Corporation|CNR]] (which became part of [[CRRC Corporation|CRRC]] the following year) to build 152 replacement railcars for the Orange Line, as well as additional cars for the Red Line.<ref name=\"chinese\"/> The other bidders were [[Bombardier Transportation]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[Hyundai Rotem]].

It proceeded from [[Sullivan Square]] along the [[Charlestown Elevated]] to the [[Canal Street Incline]] near [[North Station]]. It was carried underground by the [[Tremont Street Subway]] (now part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]), returning above ground at the [[Pleasant Street Incline]] (now closed, located just south of [[Boylston station]]). A temporary link connected from there to the [[Washington Street Elevated]], which in 1901 ran from this point via Washington Street to Dudley Square (which is most of what is now Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]]).\n\nAlso in 1901, the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened, branching at Causeway Street to provide an alternate route through downtown Boston (along the shoreline, where today there is no rail transit) to the Washington Street Elevated.\n\nIn 1908, a new '''Washington Street Tunnel''' opened, allowing Main Line service to travel from the [[Charlestown Elevated]], underground via an additional new portal at the [[Canal Street Incline]], under downtown Boston and back up again to meet the Washington Street Elevated and Atlantic Avenue Elevated near [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. The stations wee richly decorated with tile work, mosaics, and copper; after criticism of the large [[Tremont Street Subway]] headhouses, most entrances were comparatively modest and set into buildings.<ref name=newboston>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Es9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Rapid Transit and Civic Beauty |magazine=New Boston |date=November 1910 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=307\u2013314 |first=Frederick W. |last=Coburn |via=Google Books}}</ref> Use of the parallel Tremont Street Subway was returned exclusively to [[streetcar]]s.\n\nBy 1909, the Washington Street Elevated had been extended south to {{bts|Forest Hills}}. Trains from Washington Street were routed through the new subway, either all the way to Sullivan Square, or back around in a loop via the subway and then the Atlantic Avenue Elevated.\n\nIn 1919, the same year that the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially damaged in Boston's [[Great Molasses Flood]], the Charlestown Elevated was extended north from Sullivan Square to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], over surface right-of-way parallel to [[Massachusetts Route 99|Alford Street/Broadway]], with a [[Movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Mystic River]].<ref name=netransit /> The Boston Elevated had long-term plans to continue this extension further north to [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], a goal which would only be achieved decades later, under [[MBTA|public ownership]] and not via the Everett route.\n\n===Closure of Atlantic Avenue Elevated and ownership changes===\n[[File:Rowes Wharf Station (13083218675).jpg|thumb|left|Rowes Wharf station on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1942 \u2013 four years after closure \u2013 just before being demolished]]\nFollowing a 1928 accident at a tight curve on Beach Street, the southern portion of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]], between South Station and Tower D on Washington Street, was closed (except for rush-hour trips from Dudley to North Station via the Elevated), breaking the loop; non-rush-hour Atlantic Avenue service was reduced to a shuttle between North and South Stations.<ref name=\"netransit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/MBTARouteHistory.pdf|title=Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district|last=Belcher|first=Jonathan|date=27 June 2015|format=PDF|publisher=NETransit|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>  In 1938, the remainder of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed, leaving the subway as the only route through downtown \u2013 what is now the Orange Line between {{bts|Haymarket}} and {{bts|Chinatown}} stations.\n\nOwnership of the railway was transferred from the private Boston Elevated Railway to the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947; the MTA was itself reconstituted as the modern [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) in 1964.\n\n===Orange Line naming===\n[[File:Tile mosaic at Boylston Street station, October 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Station sign at Boylston Street (now Chinatown) station in 1914.

As a result of this review, the [[Charlestown Elevated]] \u2013 which served the [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] neighborhood north of downtown Boston and the inner suburb of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]] \u2013 was demolished and replaced in 1975.\n\nThe '''Haymarket North Extension''' rerouted the Orange Line through an [[Haymarket North Extension|underwater crossing]] of the [[Charles River]]. Service in Charlestown was replaced with service along [[Boston and Maine]] tracks routed partially beneath an elevated section of [[Interstate 93]], ultimately to {{bts|Wellington}} and then to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] instead of Everett.

On May 4, 1987, the Orange Line was rerouted from the southern end of the Washington Street Tunnel onto the new Southwest Corridor. Instead of rising up to elevated tracks, it now veered west at the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and followed the Pike and the old [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] right-of-way to the existing [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop at {{bts|Back Bay}}.

The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.)\n\nStarting in 2015, the MBTA began implementing its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] section of the Orange Line is located in a trench and is protected from the worst weather, but the 1970s-built [[Haymarket North Extension]] had older infrastructure and was in worse shape. From {{bts|Sullivan Square}} north, it is exposed to the weather and largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. That section is receiving new heated third rail, switch heaters, and snow fences to reduce the impacts of inclement weather.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/news/2015/09/23/how-the-mbta-getting-winter-ready/SeTjLsOSUUZ1nGlIAc5p3N/story.html |title=Winter is coming, and the MBTA is getting ready |newspaper=Boston Globe |last=Vaccaro |first=Adam |date=23 September 2015 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6442454500&month=&year |title=Gov.

These cars, known as 01100s, had been in service since the 1950s, and saw service on both the elevated and the northern extension before they were retired in 1981. Several remained on the property for some time before being scrapped. The 01100 cars were a favorite for fans, as the small motorman's cab enabled passengers to stand at the front for an operator's-eye view.\n\nThe Orange Line is [[standard gauge]] [[heavy rail]] and uses a [[third rail]] for power. The current fleet was built between 1979 and 1981 by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (now [[Alstom]]) of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada. They are 65 feet (20 m) long and 9&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (2.8 m) wide, with three pairs of doors on each side. They are based on the PA3 model used by [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] in [[New Jersey]] and the R44/R46/R62/R68 models used by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in [[New York City]] There are 120 cars, numbered 01200-01319. All in-service Orange Line trains run in six-car consists.\n\n===New CRRC trains===\n[[File:New Orange Line cars at Wellington Yard (2), August 2018.JPG|thumb|left|The first set of the new rolling stock during testing in 2018]]\n\nIn late 2008, the MBTA began the planning process for new Orange and Red Line vehicles. The agency originally planned for a simultaneous order for 146 Orange Line cars (to replace the whole fleet) and 74 Red Line cars (to replace the older 1500 and 1600 series cars). A similar order was used in the late 1970s for the current Orange Line cars and the old Blue Line cars, ordered at the same time and largely identical except for size and color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctps.org/data/pdf/studies/transit/pmt/PMT_Ch5.pdf |title=CHAPTER 5: Priorities for Achieving a State of Good Repair |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=December 2009 |page=5-2 |work=The Program for Mass Transportation |author=Central Transportation Planning Staff}}</ref> In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would provide 152 new Orange Line cars to replace the existing 120-car fleet and add more frequent service.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=27773&month=&year= |title=Governor Patrick Announces Major Transportation Funding Investments |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2014, the MassDOT Board awarded a $566.6 million contract to a [[China]] based manufacturer [[China CNR Corporation|CNR]] (which became part of [[CRRC Corporation|CRRC]] the following year) to build 152 replacement railcars for the Orange Line, as well as additional cars for the Red Line.<ref name=\"chinese\"/> The other bidders were [[Bombardier Transportation]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[Hyundai Rotem]].
