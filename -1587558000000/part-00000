{"title_page": "1908 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1908 season for Auckland consisted of four representative matches played in an effort to grow the game in Auckland and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. The team was chosen prior to the formation of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] so in some respects were an \u2018unofficial\u2019 [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team though they were very strong nonetheless and many of the players went on to represent Auckland and New Zealand in the ensuing years. Several of the players were also strongly involved in the establishment of club sides and the growth of the game in Auckland for many years to come such as [[Albert Asher]], [[Charles Dunning]], [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]], and [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]].\n\nThe four matches were against [[Wellington rugby league team|Wellington]] and [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] with games being played in Auckland, Wellington and New Plymouth. They resulted in 3 wins and a draw.\nPrior to the last match of the season against Taranaki at Victoria Park the promoters of the proposed Auckland League stated clearly their intentions. They said that it was not their intention to pay players for home matches. If any profits accrued from their last match it would be \u201cbanked to form the nucleus of a ground fund. It will be the policy of the league to provide players with uniforms, free brake trips to grounds, and payment for loss of wages when away from Auckland on tour\u201d. They went on to say that the tour had not been profitable. The money they had gained from Wellington\u2019s visit in August had been lost while on tour due to travel costs and other expenditure.

This study by James. V. Gardner et al. of the Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire splits the measurement attempt history into three main groups: early single-beam echo sounders (1950s-1970s), early multibeam echo sounders (1980s - 21st century), and modern (i.e., post-GPS, high-resolution) multibeam echo sounders. Taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the Challenger Deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed. The study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies after the analysis a depth uncertainty of \u00b1{{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (95% confidence level) on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of \u00b1{{convert|20|to|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (2drms) remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is {{convert|10984|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11.329903|N|142.199305|E|scale:100000}}. The depth measurement uncertainty is a composite of measured uncertainties in the spatial variations in sound-speed through the water volume, the ray-tracing and bottom-detection algorithms of the multibeam system, the accuracies and calibration of the motion sensor and navigation systems, estimates of spherical spreading, attenuation throughout the water volume, and so forth.<ref name=\"So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench?\">{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 maximal sonar mapping depths reported by Gardner et.al. in 2014 have not been confirmed by subsequent direct descent (pressure gauge/manometer) measurements at full-ocean depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> These expeditions have reported maximal depths in a narrow range from the 1960 depth of {{convert|10913|m|ft|abbr=on}} ({{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}) to the 2019 depth of {{convert|10925|m|ft|abbr=on}} reported by the RV {{ship||Sally Ride}} in the ''western'' basin.

Taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the Challenger Deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed.

game|multiplayer]] [[first-person shooter]] developed and published by [[Riot Games]]. The game was first announced with the codename ''Project A'' in October 2019. It is set to be released for [[Microsoft Windows]]  in the summer of 2020, with a [[closed beta]] that launched on April 7, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Valorant'' is a team-based [[tactical shooter]] and [[first-person shooter]]  set in the near-future.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020a\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020c\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> Players assume the control of agents, characters who come from a plethora of countries and cultures around the world.<ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> In the main game mode, players join either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities and use an economic system to purchase their abilities and weapons. The game has an assortment of weapons including  [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearms]], [[submachine guns]], [[shotguns]], [[machine guns]], [[assault rifles]], [[sniper rifles]].<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> Each weapon has a [[Recoil|recoil pattern]] which has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> The attacking team has a bomb, called the Spike, that they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the Spike and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the Spike, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated, the opposing team earns a point. After twelve rounds, the attacking team switches to the defending team and vice versa. The first team to win the best of 24 rounds wins the match.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Shea 2020\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" />\n\nThere are currently ten known agents in ''Valorant''.

[[Physical examination]] in the early stages does only show pain as symptom, in later stages there could be an [[Joint effusion|effusion]], tenderness, and a [[crepitus|crackling sound with joint movement]].\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nOCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called [[avascular necrosis]]. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation ([[dissection]]) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage.<ref name=\"pmid7273527\">{{cite journal|author=Pappas AM|title=Osteochondrosis dissecans|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=158|pages=59\u201369|year=1981|pmid=7273527|doi=10.1097/00003086-198107000-00009 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid1157398\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Woodward AH, Bianco AJ |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=110|pages=35\u201341|year=1975|pmid=1157398|doi=10.1097/00003086-197507000-00007|volume=110}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pettrone|first=FA|year=1986|title=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Symposium on Upper Extremity Injuries in Athletes|location=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=CV Mosby|isbn=978-0-8016-0026-5|pages=193\u2013232}}</ref> OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by [[Radiography|X-rays]], [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans.\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nNon-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, [[Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair|stem cell transplantation]], and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of [[Lying (position)|immobilization]] and [[physical therapy]]. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, [[isometric exercise]]s, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology and history -->\nOCD occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year.<ref name=\"pmid9012566\"/> Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"Inoue1991\">{{cite journal|author=Inoue, Goro|title=Bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow treated by Herbert screw fixation|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=25|issue=3|pages=142\u2013144|year=1991|pmid=1777781|doi=10.1136/bjsm.25.3.142|pmc=1478853}} See introduction and discussion sections on incidence</ref> Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. [[Franz K\u00f6nig (surgeon)|Franz K\u00f6nig]] coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an [[inflammation]] of the bone\u2013[[cartilage]] interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, [[osteonecrosis]], accessory ossification center, [[osteochondrosis]], and hereditary epiphyseal [[dysplasia]].

[[Physical examination]] in the early stages does only show pain as symptom, in later stages there could be an [[Joint effusion|effusion]], tenderness, and a [[crepitus|crackling sound with joint movement]].\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nOCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called [[avascular necrosis]]. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation ([[dissection]]) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage.<ref name=\"pmid7273527\">{{cite journal|author=Pappas AM|title=Osteochondrosis dissecans|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=158|pages=59\u201369|year=1981|pmid=7273527|doi=10.1097/00003086-198107000-00009 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid1157398\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Woodward AH, Bianco AJ |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=110|pages=35\u201341|year=1975|pmid=1157398|doi=10.1097/00003086-197507000-00007|volume=110}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pettrone|first=FA|year=1986|title=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Symposium on Upper Extremity Injuries in Athletes|location=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=CV Mosby|isbn=978-0-8016-0026-5|pages=193\u2013232}}</ref> OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by [[Radiography|X-rays]], [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans.\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nNon-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, [[Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair|stem cell transplantation]], and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of [[Lying (position)|immobilization]] and [[physical therapy]]. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, [[isometric exercise]]s, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology and history -->\nOCD occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year.<ref name=\"pmid9012566\"/> Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"Inoue1991\">{{cite journal|author=Inoue, Goro|title=Bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow treated by Herbert screw fixation|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=25|issue=3|pages=142\u2013144|year=1991|pmid=1777781|doi=10.1136/bjsm.25.3.142|pmc=1478853}} See introduction and discussion sections on incidence</ref> Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling.

[[Franz K\u00f6nig (surgeon)|Franz K\u00f6nig]] coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an [[inflammation]] of the bone\u2013[[cartilage]] interface.
