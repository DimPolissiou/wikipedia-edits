In its original incarnation, as '''RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.''' (a subsidiary of Radio-Keith-Orpheum, aka: RKO)<ref>{{cite web |title=RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/RKO-Radio-Pictures-Inc |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=2018-11-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it was one of the [[studio system|Big Five]] [[major film studio|studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s [[Cinema of the United States#Portrait of Classical Hollywood Cinema (1917\u20131960)|Golden Age]]. The business was formed after the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) theater chain and [[Joseph P. Kennedy|Joseph P. Kennedy's]] [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) studio were brought together under the control of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in October 1928.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} RCA chief [[David Sarnoff]] engineered the merger to create a market for the company's [[sound-on-film]] technology, [[RCA Photophone]]. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor [[Floyd Odlum]].\n\nRKO has long been renowned for its cycle of musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors [[Katharine Hepburn]] and, later, [[Robert Mitchum]] had their first major successes at the studio. [[Cary Grant]] was a mainstay for years. The work of producer [[Val Lewton]]'s low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as [[film noir]] have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. RKO was also responsible for notable co-productions such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and it also distributed many celebrated films by animation producer [[Walt Disney]] (from 1937 to the mid-1950s) and leading independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions|Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nMaverick industrialist [[Howard Hughes]] took over RKO in 1948. After years of disarray and decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster [[RKO General]], the corporate heir, revived the studio as a production subsidiary, '''RKO Pictures Inc.''' In 1989, this business, with its remaining assets, including the [[trademarks]] and [[remake]] rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the small independent company '''RKO Pictures LLC'''.\n\n==Origin of company==\nIn October 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to convert from silent to [[sound film]] production en masse. The [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) controlled an advanced optical [[sound-on-film]] system, [[RCA Photophone|Photophone]], recently developed by [[General Electric]], RCA's parent company. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of [[AT&T (1885-2005)|AT&T]]'s [[Western Electric]] division. The industry's two largest companies, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's]]/[[MGM]], with two other [[major film studio|major studios]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 9; Lasky (1989), pp. 22\u201324; Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), pp. 129\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[Image:RadioKeithOrpheum.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Early Radio-Keith-Orpheum logo]]\nSeeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 [[David Sarnoff]], then general manager of RCA, approached [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO; Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live [[vaudeville]], was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of [[Path\u00e9 Exchange|Path\u00e9 (U.S.)]] and [[Cecil B. De Mille]] had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Path\u00e9, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] (PDC). This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.<ref name=Start>Goodwin (1987), pp. 375\u201379; Jewell (1982), pp. 9\u201310; Lasky (1989), pp. 25\u201327; Gomery (1985), pp. 63\u201365; Crafton (1997), pp. 136\u201339, 193\u201394.</ref><ref>\"Cinemerger\", ''Time'', May 2, 1927 (available [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751696,00.html online]).</ref>{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}\n\nAfter an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced the creation of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp. holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Path\u00e9 separate from RKO and under his personal control.<ref name=Start/><ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 28\u201329.</ref> RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent (in the early 1930s, its share would rise as high as 60 percent).<ref name=\"Crafton 1997, p. 210\">Crafton (1997), p. 210.</ref> On January 25, 1929, the new company's production arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I.

On January 29, 1931, Path\u00e9, with its contract players, well-regarded newsreel operation, and [[Culver Studios|Culver City studio and backlot]], was merged into RKO as Kennedy sold off the last of his stock in the company he had been instrumental in creating.<ref>Goodwin (1987), pp. 422\u201323; Jewell (1982), p. 32; Crafton (1997), pp. 208, 210.</ref>\n\n==Golden Age studio==\n===Early years===\n[[Image:RioRitaPoster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929), first smash hit for RKO (then releasing films under the \"Radio Pictures\" banner)]]\nWhilst the main FBO studio in Hollywood underwent a technological refit, RKO began production at the small facility FBO shared with Path\u00e9 in [[New York City]].<ref>Barrios (1995), p. 87; {{cite news |newspaper=Film Daily |title=$250,000 for Construction Program at RKO Studio |date=1929-01-23 |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily4748newy#page/n175/mode/2up/search/%22RKO%22 |access-date=2015-12-05 |df=mdy-all}}{{Open access}}</ref> In charge of production was [[William LeBaron]], who had held the same position at FBO.

RKO spent heavily on the lavish ''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'', including a number of [[Technicolor]] sequences. Opening in September to rave reviews, it was named one of the ten best pictures of the year by ''Film Daily''.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 42\u201347; Barrios (1995), pp. 225\u201329.</ref> Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with initiating the \"first age of the filmed Broadway musical\".<ref>Barrios (1995), p. 225.</ref> By the end of the year, RKO was making use of an additional production facility\u2014five hundred acres had been acquired near [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] as a [[movie ranch]] for exteriors and large-scale standing sets,<ref>Jewell (2012), p. 22.</ref> AKA; RKO Encino Movie Ranch.\n\nRKO released a limited slate of twelve features in its first year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine.<ref>Jewell (1982), pp. 20, 24.</ref> Initially organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition into the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc.<ref>Catalogue of Copyright Entries (1930), p. 369 et al.</ref> Encouraged by ''Rio Rita''{{'}}s success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them ''[[Dixiana (film)|Dixiana]]'' and ''[[Hit the Deck (1930 film)|Hit the Deck]]'', both scripted and directed, like ''Rio Rita'', by [[Luther Reed]].<ref>Barrios (1995), p. 127; Lasky (1989), p. 52.</ref> Following the example of the other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical [[revue]], ''Radio Revels''. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 260; \"R.-K.-O. Signs More Noted Names\", ''Los Angeles Times'', June 20, 1929; \"Studios Plan Huge Programs\", ''Los Angeles Times'', July 21, 1929.</ref> The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 279.</ref> RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, ''[[The Runaround (1931 film)|The Runaround]]'' and ''[[Fanny Foley Herself]]'' (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.<ref>Jewell (1982), pp. 38, 41.

In October 1930, the company purchased a 50 percent stake in the New York [[Van Beuren Studios|Van Beuren]] studio, which specialized in cartoons and live shorts.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 210; Barrier (2003), p. 169.</ref> RKO's production schedule soon surpassed forty features a year, released under the names \"Radio Pictures\" and, for a short time after the 1931 merger, \"RKO Path\u00e9\". ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1931), produced by LeBaron himself, would become the only RKO production to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]; nonetheless, having cost a profligate $1.4 million to make, it was a money-loser on original domestic release.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 552; Lasky (1989), p. 55.</ref>{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} The most popular RKO star of this [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] era was [[Irene Dunne]], who made her debut as the lead in the 1930 musical ''[[Leathernecking]]'' and was a headliner at the studio for the entire decade.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 30.</ref> Other major performers included [[Joel McCrea]], [[Ricardo Cortez]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Mary Astor]]. [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar-nominated]] for his lead performance in ''Cimarron'', would serve as RKO's standby [[B-movie]] star until the early 1940s.<ref>Finler (2003), pp. 221, 223.</ref> The comedy team of [[Wheeler & Woolsey|Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey]], often wrangling over ingenue [[Dorothy Lee (actress)|Dorothy Lee]], was a bankable mainstay for years.<ref>Finler (2003), p. 214.</ref> [[Constance Bennett]], [[Ann Harding]], and [[Helen Twelvetrees]] came over with Path\u00e9.<ref>Lasky (1989), p. 74.</ref> The Path\u00e9 acquisition, though a defensible investment in the long term for its physical facilities, was yet another major expense borne by the fledgling RKO, particularly as Path\u00e9's stock price had been artificially inflated by some prepurchase finagling.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 58\u201359.</ref> After little more than a year of semiautonomous operation within RKO, Path\u00e9 was dissolved as a feature production unit.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 44.</ref>\n\n===Success under Selznick===\n[[Image:KingKongStyleA.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), one of Hollywood's great spectacles]]\nExceptions like ''Cimarron'' and ''Rio Rita'' aside, RKO's product was largely regarded as mediocre, so in October 1931 Sarnoff hired twenty-nine-year-old [[David O. Selznick]] to replace LeBaron as production chief.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 67\u201370.</ref> In addition to implementing rigorous cost-control measures, Selznick championed the unit production system, which gave the [[Film producer|producers]] of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. \"Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism\", said Selznick, \"and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made.\"<ref name=Bord321>Bordwell et al. (1985), p. 321.</ref> Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of 30\u201340 percent.<ref name=Bord321/> To make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize behind-the-camera personnel, such as [[Film director|director]] [[George Cukor]] and producer/director [[Merian C.

Berman]], aged twenty-six, increasingly important projects.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 74\u201376; Jewell (1982), p. 17.</ref> Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who would quickly be counted as one of the studio's big stars, [[Katharine Hepburn]]. [[John Barrymore]] was also enlisted for a few memorable performances.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 77\u201380, 93.</ref> From September 1932 on, print advertising for the company's features displayed the revised name \"RKO Radio Pictures\"; the Path\u00e9 name was used only for newsreels and documentaries.{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} That year, the New York City\u2013based corporate headquarters moved into the new RKO Building, an [[Art Deco]] skyscraper that was one of the first [[Rockefeller Center]] structures to open.<ref>Kroessler (2002), p. 219.</ref>\n\nSelznick spent a mere fifteen months as RKO production chief, resigning over a dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth concerning creative control.<ref>Schatz (1998), pp. 131\u201333; Lasky (1989), pp. 81\u201382.</ref> One of his last acts at RKO was to approve a [[screen test]] for a thirty-three-year-old, balding [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] song-and-dance man named [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>Schatz (1998), p. 133; Lasky (1989), p. 83.</ref> In a memo, Selznick wrote, \"I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is ... tremendous\".<ref>Mueller (1986), p. 7.</ref> Selznick's tenure was widely considered masterful: In 1931, before he arrived, the studio had produced forty-two features for $16 million in total budgets. In 1932, under Selznick, forty-one features were made for $10.2 million, with clear improvement in quality and popularity.<ref>Schatz (1998), pp. 131.</ref> He backed several major successes, including ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932), with Cukor directing Hepburn's debut, and the monumental ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933)\u2014largely Merian Cooper's brainchild, brought to life by the astonishing [[special effects]] work of [[Willis O'Brien]].<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 78\u201379, 93\u201395; Jewell (1982), pp. 52, 60.</ref> Still, the shaky finances and excesses that marked the company's pre-Selznick days had not left RKO in shape to withstand the [[Great Depression|Depression]]; in early 1933, the studio sank into [[receivership]], from which it did not emerge until 1940.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n===Cooper at the helm===\n[[Image:TopHatORGI.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]], the only performers ever to make the annual list of top box office stars while with RKO.<ref>Finler (2003), p. 221.</ref> ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935) was the third of the eight films in which they costarred between 1934 and 1939.]]\nCooper took over as production head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), for which she won her [[Academy Award for Best Actress|first Oscar]], and ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'' (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 100\u20131.</ref> Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade.<ref name=F219>Finler (2003), p. 219.</ref> [[Ginger Rogers]] had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933).<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 98\u201399.</ref> Rogers was paired with [[Fred Astaire]], making his movie debut.

In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, [[GenCorp]]'s) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]].<ref name=FU>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GenCorp-Inc-Company-History.html|title=GenCorp Inc.\u2014Company History|publisher=Funding Universe|date=|access-date=2010-04-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated, most influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, [[KHJ (AM)]] in Los Angeles introduced the [[Boss Radio]] variation of the [[top 40]] format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country.<ref>Fong-Torres (2001), pp. 172\u201376; Denisoff (1986), pp. 242\u201351.</ref> RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, including [[WRKS-FM#WOR-FM|WOR]] and [[WRKS-FM#WXLO 99X|WXLO]] (\"99X\"); in 1983, as [[WRKS-FM#WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM|WRKS]] (\"98.7 Kiss FM\"), it became one of the first major stations to regularly program [[hip hop music|rap music]].<ref>Keyes (2004), p. 99.</ref> In 1979, RKO General created the [[RKO Radio Network]], reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.<ref>Cox (2009), p. 198.</ref>\n\nThe company's television stations, for the most part non\u2013network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of ''Million Dollar Movie'', launched by New York's [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] in 1954.<ref>For the early history of ''Million Dollar Movie'' and WOR's film programming, see Segrave (1999), pp. 40, 48; \"News of TV and Radio; 'Studio One' Returns for the Winter Season\", ''New York Times'', September 19, 1954 (excerpted [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/million_dollar_movie/ online]); \"WOR-TV Acquires 10 Selznick Films; It Pays Record $198,000 for 'Package'\u2014Will Be Shown on 'Million Dollar Movie' Discord Theme of Show\", ''New York Times'', February 25, 1956; \"2 Feature Films Bought By WOR-TV; Station Adds 'Champion' and 'Home of the Brave' to its 'Million Dollar Movie,'\" ''New York Times'', June 16, 1956.</ref> In June 1962, RKO General and [[Zenith Electronics]] initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's [[WUVN|WHCT-TV]] aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges.<ref>\"Fee-Vee,\" ''Time'', July 6, 1962 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940031,00.html online]); \"Payday, Some Day,\" ''Time'', December 27, 1968 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900475,00.html online]); Mullen, Megan, \"The Prehistory of Pay Cable Television: An Overview and Analysis,\" ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', vol. 19, no. 1 (January 1, 1999).</ref> However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.<ref name=FU/><ref>\"Turning Off RKO's Licenses,\" ''Time'', August 24, 1987 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965303,00.html online]); \"RKO Appeals F.C.C.

Retrieved 2010-05-03. Many other online resources make the same false claim or similar ones (e.g., that the RCA Photophone business was made part of RKO).<br />\nNote also the following:\n{{bulleted list\n| Many sources incorrectly describe Keith-Albee-Orpheum as the union of three theater chains; in fact the name describes the union of just two chains, B. F. Keith Corp. (doing business as Keith-Albee) and [[Orpheum Circuit Inc.]] [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward F. Albee]] was [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Benjamin F. Keith]]'s right-hand man. He took over the company after the deaths of its founder, in 1914, and his son, A.

The following corrections must be made to a single paragraph:\n| FBO's full name was ''not'' \"Film Booking Office\" (see above).\n| RCA Photophone was ''not'' \"amalgamated\" with FBO and KAO under the Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company.<ref>See, e.g., Lasky (1989), p. 120.</ref>\n| The company did ''not'' \"contain\" anything close to \"three hundred theaters\" (see note b, below).\n| Until its acquisition of Path\u00e9 in 1931, RKO did ''not'' \"contain ... four studios\" in either sense of the term\u2014production company (it \"contained\" one: FBO) or permanent production facility (it had, even by a generous count, three: FBO's Hollywood studio, the small New York studio FBO shared with Path\u00e9, and the [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]] [[movie ranch]] RKO established in 1929).\n}}\n|{{Note label|B|b|none}} The reference in Jewell (1982) to \"the 700 K-A-O Theatres in the US and Canada\" (p.&nbsp;10) is inaccurate. ''Time'' (1927) indicates that as of May 1927, Keith-Albee (legally the B. F. Keith Corp.) had 50 theaters and Orpheum had 47. Crafton (1997) claims KAO had \"200 theaters\" at the time of RKO's founding (p.&nbsp;141), though he references no contemporary source. He does cite ''Film Daily'' in a description of RKO as controlling 250 theaters in 1930, following a \"buying binge\" (p.&nbsp;256). Schatz (1998) describes an \"RKO chain of 161 theaters\" around the time David O. Selznick became production chief in October 1931 (p.&nbsp;128). Schatz (1999) writes that as of 1940, RKO had \"slightly more than 100 theaters\" (p.&nbsp;17). He explains that \"the figures on studio-affiliated theaters vary considerably, owing to the number of houses in which the studios held only partial interest\u2014as little as 5 percent in some cases\" (p.&nbsp;484, n. 24). A 1944 book, ''Economic Control of the Motion Picture Industry'', includes the table \"Theater holdings of the major companies are approximately as follows\"\u2014RKO is listed as holding 222 theaters.<ref>Huettig (1944), p. 296.</ref> Lasky (1989) indicates that a 1953 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article tallied the RKO circuit in 1948, at the time of Hughes's purchase, at \"124 theaters, plus a share in about 75 others\" (p.&nbsp;205).\n|{{Note label|C|c|none}} The standard history and reference guide to the studio's films, ''The RKO Story'', by Richard B. Jewell, with Vernon Harbin (New York: Arlington House/Crown, 1982) is used as the final arbiter of whether specific films made between 1929 and 1957 were RKO solo productions, coproductions, or completely independent productions. Official year of release is also per ''The RKO Story''.\n|{{Note label|D|d|none}} Only one previous sound film had cost more than $1 million, and just barely: ''Noah's Ark'' (1929), from Warner Bros.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 549.</ref>\n|{{Note label|E|e|none}} For the switch to the RKO Radio Pictures brand at the beginning of the 1932\u201333 exhibition season for U.S. print advertising, see, e.g., [[:File:Most Dangerous Game poster.jpg|this original poster]] for ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', which premiered September 9, 1932.<ref>Senn (1996), p. 109.</ref>\n|{{Note label|F|f|none}} Among still-ascendant male stars, Grant was preceded by the more established [[Fredric March]] as a freelancer.

(and, indeed, was billed on a title card as \"A Mercury Production\"), in bottom-line terms it was an RKO production: the studio provided the entire budget and production facilities, assumed all the financial risk, and held all the rights once Welles delivered his final, inviolable cut.<ref name=\"CKAFI\"/><ref>Carringer (1985), pp. 1, p. 151 n.

For ''The Magnificent Ambersons'': Jewell (1982), p. 173. For ''It's All True'': Brady (1990), p. 346. For corporate deficit and profit: Jewell (1982), pp. 144, 156.</ref> Note that the studio operation itself was almost certainly a bigger money-loser than the cited figures suggest, with profits coming from the corporation's theatrical division.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 168.</ref>\n|{{Note label|K|k|none}} Jewell (1982) states that it \"attracted $3,355,000 in film rentals\" (p.&nbsp;181); Lasky (1989) refers to an article in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' on the film, published seven months after its premiere, predicting it \"would do better than $3 million in the U.S. alone\" (p.&nbsp;185). It is not listed in Schatz's (1999) appendix of annual top box-office films of the 1940s (p.&nbsp;466), based on a 1992 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reckoning, perhaps because of its unusual production history. Assuming Jewell's figure is accurate, and the Schatz/''Variety'' list is otherwise accurate and complete, ''Hitler's Children'' was the ninth biggest earner of 1943, a very impressive feat for a movie with a B budget and star (Tim Holt).\n|{{Note label|L|l|none}} Many online sources give RKO General's year of inception as 1958, without evidence; O'Neill's 1959 dating is supported by the fact that there is no mention of RKO General in either the ''New York Times'' or the ''Los Angeles Times'' before February 1960.\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Ballinger, Alexander, and Danny Graydon (2007).

In its original incarnation, as '''RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.''' (a subsidiary of Radio-Keith-Orpheum, aka: RKO)<ref>{{cite web |title=RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/RKO-Radio-Pictures-Inc |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=2018-11-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it was one of the [[studio system|Big Five]] [[major film studio|studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s [[Cinema of the United States#Portrait of Classical Hollywood Cinema (1917\u20131960)|Golden Age]]. The business was formed after the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) theater chain and [[Joseph P. Kennedy|Joseph P. Kennedy's]] [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) studio were brought together under the control of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in October 1928.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} RCA chief [[David Sarnoff]] engineered the merger to create a market for the company's [[sound-on-film]] technology, [[RCA Photophone]]. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor [[Floyd Odlum]].\n\nRKO has long been renowned for its cycle of musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors [[Katharine Hepburn]] and, later, [[Robert Mitchum]] had their first major successes at the studio. [[Cary Grant]] was a mainstay for years. The work of producer [[Val Lewton]]'s low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as [[film noir]] have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. RKO was also responsible for notable co-productions such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and it also distributed many celebrated films by animation producer [[Walt Disney]] (from 1937 to the mid-1950s) and leading independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions|Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nMaverick industrialist [[Howard Hughes]] took over RKO in 1948. After years of disarray and decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster [[RKO General]], the corporate heir, revived the studio as a production subsidiary, '''RKO Pictures Inc.''' In 1989, this business, with its remaining assets, including the [[trademarks]] and [[remake]] rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the small independent company '''RKO Pictures LLC'''.\n\n==Origin of company==\nIn October 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to convert from silent to [[sound film]] production en masse. The [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) controlled an advanced optical [[sound-on-film]] system, [[RCA Photophone|Photophone]], recently developed by [[General Electric]], RCA's parent company. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of [[AT&T (1885-2005)|AT&T]]'s [[Western Electric]] division. The industry's two largest companies, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's]]/[[MGM]], with two other [[major film studio|major studios]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 9; Lasky (1989), pp. 22\u201324; Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), pp. 129\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[Image:RadioKeithOrpheum.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Early Radio-Keith-Orpheum logo]]\nSeeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 [[David Sarnoff]], then general manager of RCA, approached [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO; Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live [[vaudeville]], was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of [[Path\u00e9 Exchange|Path\u00e9 (U.S.)]] and [[Cecil B. De Mille]] had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Path\u00e9, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] (PDC). This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.<ref name=Start>Goodwin (1987), pp. 375\u201379; Jewell (1982), pp. 9\u201310; Lasky (1989), pp. 25\u201327; Gomery (1985), pp. 63\u201365; Crafton (1997), pp. 136\u201339, 193\u201394.</ref><ref>\"Cinemerger\", ''Time'', May 2, 1927 (available [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751696,00.html online]).</ref>{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}\n\nAfter an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced the creation of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp. holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Path\u00e9 separate from RKO and under his personal control.<ref name=Start/><ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 28\u201329.</ref> RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent (in the early 1930s, its share would rise as high as 60 percent).<ref name=\"Crafton 1997, p. 210\">Crafton (1997), p. 210.</ref> On January 25, 1929, the new company's production arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I.

On January 29, 1931, Path\u00e9, with its contract players, well-regarded newsreel operation, and [[Culver Studios|Culver City studio and backlot]], was merged into RKO as Kennedy sold off the last of his stock in the company he had been instrumental in creating.<ref>Goodwin (1987), pp. 422\u201323; Jewell (1982), p. 32; Crafton (1997), pp. 208, 210.</ref>\n\n==Golden Age studio==\n===Early years===\n[[Image:RioRitaPoster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929), first smash hit for RKO (then releasing films under the \"Radio Pictures\" banner)]]\nWhilst the main FBO studio in Hollywood underwent a technological refit, RKO began production at the small facility FBO shared with Path\u00e9 in [[New York City]].<ref>Barrios (1995), p. 87; {{cite news |newspaper=Film Daily |title=$250,000 for Construction Program at RKO Studio |date=1929-01-23 |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily4748newy#page/n175/mode/2up/search/%22RKO%22 |access-date=2015-12-05 |df=mdy-all}}{{Open access}}</ref> In charge of production was [[William LeBaron]], who had held the same position at FBO.

Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 260; \"R.-K.-O.

From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 279.</ref> RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, ''[[The Runaround (1931 film)|The Runaround]]'' and ''[[Fanny Foley Herself]]'' (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.<ref>Jewell (1982), pp. 38, 41.

In October 1930, the company purchased a 50 percent stake in the New York [[Van Beuren Studios|Van Beuren]] studio, which specialized in cartoons and live shorts.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 210; Barrier (2003), p. 169.</ref> RKO's production schedule soon surpassed forty features a year, released under the names \"Radio Pictures\" and, for a short time after the 1931 merger, \"RKO Path\u00e9\". ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1931), produced by LeBaron himself, would become the only RKO production to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]; nonetheless, having cost a profligate $1.4 million to make, it was a money-loser on original domestic release.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 552; Lasky (1989), p. 55.</ref>{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} The most popular RKO star of this [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] era was [[Irene Dunne]], who made her debut as the lead in the 1930 musical ''[[Leathernecking]]'' and was a headliner at the studio for the entire decade.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 30.</ref> Other major performers included [[Joel McCrea]], [[Ricardo Cortez]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Mary Astor]].

The British government imposed a 75 percent tax on films produced abroad; along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, this led to a sharp decline in foreign revenues.<ref>Schatz (1999), pp. 299, 331; Lasky (1989), p. 202.</ref><ref name=J216>Jewell (1982), p. 216.</ref> The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest.

Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' Under the [[consent decree]] he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations\u2014RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.\u2014with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other.

In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, [[GenCorp]]'s) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]].<ref name=FU>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GenCorp-Inc-Company-History.html|title=GenCorp Inc.\u2014Company History|publisher=Funding Universe|date=|access-date=2010-04-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated, most influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, [[KHJ (AM)]] in Los Angeles introduced the [[Boss Radio]] variation of the [[top 40]] format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country.<ref>Fong-Torres (2001), pp. 172\u201376; Denisoff (1986), pp. 242\u201351.</ref> RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, including [[WRKS-FM#WOR-FM|WOR]] and [[WRKS-FM#WXLO 99X|WXLO]] (\"99X\"); in 1983, as [[WRKS-FM#WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM|WRKS]] (\"98.7 Kiss FM\"), it became one of the first major stations to regularly program [[hip hop music|rap music]].<ref>Keyes (2004), p. 99.</ref> In 1979, RKO General created the [[RKO Radio Network]], reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.<ref>Cox (2009), p. 198.</ref>\n\nThe company's television stations, for the most part non\u2013network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of ''Million Dollar Movie'', launched by New York's [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] in 1954.<ref>For the early history of ''Million Dollar Movie'' and WOR's film programming, see Segrave (1999), pp. 40, 48; \"News of TV and Radio; 'Studio One' Returns for the Winter Season\", ''New York Times'', September 19, 1954 (excerpted [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/million_dollar_movie/ online]); \"WOR-TV Acquires 10 Selznick Films; It Pays Record $198,000 for 'Package'\u2014Will Be Shown on 'Million Dollar Movie' Discord Theme of Show\", ''New York Times'', February 25, 1956; \"2 Feature Films Bought By WOR-TV; Station Adds 'Champion' and 'Home of the Brave' to its 'Million Dollar Movie,'\" ''New York Times'', June 16, 1956.</ref> In June 1962, RKO General and [[Zenith Electronics]] initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's [[WUVN|WHCT-TV]] aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges.<ref>\"Fee-Vee,\" ''Time'', July 6, 1962 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940031,00.html online]); \"Payday, Some Day,\" ''Time'', December 27, 1968 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900475,00.html online]); Mullen, Megan, \"The Prehistory of Pay Cable Television: An Overview and Analysis,\" ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', vol. 19, no. 1 (January 1, 1999).</ref> However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] pressure.

Crafton (1997) claims KAO had \"200 theaters\" at the time of RKO's founding (p.&nbsp;141), though he references no contemporary source. He does cite ''Film Daily'' in a description of RKO as controlling 250 theaters in 1930, following a \"buying binge\" (p.&nbsp;256). Schatz (1998) describes an \"RKO chain of 161 theaters\" around the time David O. Selznick became production chief in October 1931 (p.&nbsp;128). Schatz (1999) writes that as of 1940, RKO had \"slightly more than 100 theaters\" (p.&nbsp;17). He explains that \"the figures on studio-affiliated theaters vary considerably, owing to the number of houses in which the studios held only partial interest\u2014as little as 5 percent in some cases\" (p.&nbsp;484, n. 24). A 1944 book, ''Economic Control of the Motion Picture Industry'', includes the table \"Theater holdings of the major companies are approximately as follows\"\u2014RKO is listed as holding 222 theaters.<ref>Huettig (1944), p. 296.</ref> Lasky (1989) indicates that a 1953 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article tallied the RKO circuit in 1948, at the time of Hughes's purchase, at \"124 theaters, plus a share in about 75 others\" (p.&nbsp;205).\n|{{Note label|C|c|none}} The standard history and reference guide to the studio's films, ''The RKO Story'', by Richard B.

I-1.</ref>\n|{{Note label|J|j|none}} ''Citizen Kane'' lost $150,000\u2013$160,000 on original release (the production cost was precisely $805,527.53); ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' lost $624,000 (production cost $1.125 million); and the unreleased ''It's All True'' cost the studio an estimated $1.2 million.<ref>For ''Citizen Kane'': Brady (1990), pp. 288, 311; Jewell (1982), p. 164. For ''The Magnificent Ambersons'': Jewell (1982), p. 173. For ''It's All True'': Brady (1990), p. 346. For corporate deficit and profit: Jewell (1982), pp. 144, 156.</ref> Note that the studio operation itself was almost certainly a bigger money-loser than the cited figures suggest, with profits coming from the corporation's theatrical division.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 168.</ref>\n|{{Note label|K|k|none}} Jewell (1982) states that it \"attracted $3,355,000 in film rentals\" (p.&nbsp;181); Lasky (1989) refers to an article in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' on the film, published seven months after its premiere, predicting it \"would do better than $3 million in the U.S. alone\" (p.&nbsp;185). It is not listed in Schatz's (1999) appendix of annual top box-office films of the 1940s (p.&nbsp;466), based on a 1992 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reckoning, perhaps because of its unusual production history. Assuming Jewell's figure is accurate, and the Schatz/''Variety'' list is otherwise accurate and complete, ''Hitler's Children'' was the ninth biggest earner of 1943, a very impressive feat for a movie with a B budget and star (Tim Holt).\n|{{Note label|L|l|none}} Many online sources give RKO General's year of inception as 1958, without evidence; O'Neill's 1959 dating is supported by the fact that there is no mention of RKO General in either the ''New York Times'' or the ''Los Angeles Times'' before February 1960.\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Ballinger, Alexander, and Danny Graydon (2007).

('''BNP''') resulted from a merger of two French banks \u2013 [[Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie]] (BNCI) and [[Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris]] (CNEP) \u2013 in 1966.\n\nThe '''Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A.''' (''Bank of Paris and the Netherlands''), or '''[[Paribas]]''', was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. ''Les Pays-Bas'' (\"The Low Countries\") is French for the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.\n\n===Heritage===\n\n====BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)====\n{{Main|Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris|Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie}}\nOn 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the [[Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris]] (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.\n\nSeparately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de cr\u00e9dit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank [[Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie]] (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs.  The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble.  After the [[Second World War]], it continued to grow steadily.  It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the [[French colonial empire]].\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to \"put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction\". [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]], then [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 [[nationalized]] the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]].\n\nIn 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).\n\nThe bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel P\u00e9bereau as part of a [[Jacques Chirac#Chirac's second ministry|second Chirac government's]] [[privatization]] policy.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/bnp-paribas-group-history/ |title=BNP Paribas Group History |publisher=St James Press |journal=International Directory of Company Histories |volume=36 |year=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043527/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/bnp-paribas-group-history/ |archivedate=4 April 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnpparibas.co.uk/en/bnp-paribas/bnp-paribas-group/history-of-the-group/ |title=The BNP Paribas Group \u2013 History of the Group |publisher=BNP Paribas |accessdate=15 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914130905/http://www.bnpparibas.co.uk/en/bnp-paribas/bnp-paribas-group/history-of-the-group/ |archivedate=14 September 2013  }}</ref>\n\n====Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)====\n{{See also|Paribas|Bischoffsheim family}}\n[[Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas]] ([[Paribas]]) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of ''Banque de Cr\u00e9dit et de D\u00e9p\u00f4t des Pays-Bas'', which had been established in 1820 by [[Louis-Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]] in Amsterdam, and ''Banque de Paris'', which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.\n\nDuring the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the [[First World War]] and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the [[Great Depression]]. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.\n\nAfter World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an [[investment bank]] and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as [[Groupe Bull]] and [[Thomson-CSF]].\n\nThe bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of [[Pierre Mauroy]] under [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac government]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture.  This included selling the [[Ottoman Bank]] to [[Do\u011fu\u015f Holding]], and setting up the joint venture lending company [[Cetelem]] in Germany.  It sold [[Cr\u00e9dit du Nord]] to [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and in 1998 it merged with ''Compagnie Bancaire'', renaming the bank with the official name ''Compagnie Financi\u00e8re de Paribas''.\n\n===Founding of BNP Paribas===\nIn 1999, BNP and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 23 May 2000.\n\nOn 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it.  This day is now generally seen as the start of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|credit crisis]] and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as [[UBS]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7922946/BNP-Paribas-makes-first-asset-write-back-since-2007.html| title=BNP Paribas makes first asset write back since 2007| author=Harry Wilson| date=3 August 2010| accessdate=6 April 2011| work=The Telegraph| location=London| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121102607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7922946/BNP-Paribas-makes-first-asset-write-back-since-2007.html| archivedate=21 November 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=Market Watch| author=Morning Zhou| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-stocks-may-fall-on-credit-woes-global-selloff?siteid=rss| title=Asian stocks may fall on credit woes, global sell-off| date=9 August 2007| accessdate=6 April 2011| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607102347/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-stocks-may-fall-on-credit-woes-global-selloff?siteid=rss| archivedate=7 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]]' activities in [[Belgium]], and 66% in [[Luxembourg]], in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder.

The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.\n\n== Business units ==\nIn 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:\n\nRetail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).\n\nAt the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).\n\n===Retail banking===\nRetail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro|Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)]]), and [[Belgium]] (as [[BNP Paribas Fortis]]). The group also owns an American subsidiary [[BancWest]] which operates as [[Bank of the West]] in the western United States. Previously the retail subsidiary operated [[First Hawaiian Bank]], a position that BNP Paribas fully exited in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://group.bnpparibas/en/press-release/secondary-offering-hawaiian-common-stock|title=Last Secondary Offering of First Hawaiian Common Stock - BNP Paribas|work=BNP Paribas|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-US}}</ref> BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.\n\nBNP Paribas is the largest bank in the [[Eurozone]] by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to ''[[The Banker]]'' magazine, just behind [[Banco Santander]]. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.\n\n====Domestic markets====\n* France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 [[automated teller machine|ATMs]]. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of \u20ac6.1&nbsp;billion (15.2% of total group's), income of \u20ac1.5&nbsp;billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://invest.bnpparibas.com/en/pid748/registrationdocument.html|title=Annual Registration Document 2009|date=11 March 2010|publisher=BNP Paribas|accessdate=17 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802071353/http://invest.bnpparibas.com/en/pid748/registrationdocument.html|archivedate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro|Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)]], Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed \u20ac2.9&nbsp;billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and \u20ac540&nbsp;million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\"/>\n* Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired [[BNP Paribas Fortis]] when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the \"Europe Mediterranean\" division.\n\n====United States====\nIn the United States, BNP Paribas owns [[BancWest]], which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries [[Bank of the West]] and previously operated [[First Hawaiian Bank]]. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest foreign bank by assets), while [[First Hawaiian Bank|First Hawaiian]] is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.\n\nThe two banks were merged into BancWest in 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.\n\nThe group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had \u20ac2.1&nbsp;billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\"/> BancWest lost \u20ac223&nbsp;million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in California, [[Arizona]], and [[Nevada]].\n\n====Emerging markets====\nIn 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its \"Emerging Markets\" group the \"Europe Mediterranean\" group. This change was made because after the integration of [[Fortis Bank]]'s Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the [[Mediterranean basin]].\n\nBNP Paribas is a member of the [[Global ATM Alliance]], a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] card or [[check card]] at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are [[Barclays]] (United Kingdom), [[Bank of America]] (United States), [[China Construction Bank]] (China), [[Deutsche Bank]] (Germany), [[Banco Santander (Mexico)|Santander Serfin]] ([[Mexico]]), [[Ukrsibbank]] ([[Ukraine]]), [[Scotiabank]] (Canada) and [[Westpac]] (Australia and New Zealand).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=1886 |title=Five big banks form Global ATM Alliance |publisher=ATMmarketplace.com |date=9 January 2002 |accessdate=22 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507142245/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=1886 |archivedate=7 May 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Corporate and Institutional Banking===\n{{Main|BNP Paribas CIB}}\n[[File:BNP Paribas London Trading Floor.jpg|{{largethumb}}|One of BNP Paribas' London Trading Floors.]]\n\nIn addition to its retail activities, BNP Paribas is also a leading global investment bank through its Corporate & Institutional Banking unit.

The Shanghai-based ''Oriental Morning Post'' said BNP would pay up to US$100&nbsp;million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper ''[[La Tribune]]'' reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks\u2014Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou\u2014and was prepared to invest US$50\u2013100&nbsp;million. \"We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith.

('''BNP''') resulted from a merger of two French banks \u2013 [[Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie]] (BNCI) and [[Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris]] (CNEP) \u2013 in 1966.\n\nThe '''Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A.''' (''Bank of Paris and the Netherlands''), or '''[[Paribas]]''', was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. ''Les Pays-Bas'' (\"The Low Countries\") is French for the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.\n\n===Heritage===\n\n====BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)====\n{{Main|Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris|Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie}}\nOn 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the [[Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris]] (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.\n\nSeparately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de cr\u00e9dit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank [[Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie]] (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs.  The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble.  After the [[Second World War]], it continued to grow steadily.  It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the [[French colonial empire]].\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to \"put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction\". [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]], then [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 [[nationalized]] the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]].\n\nIn 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).\n\nThe bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel P\u00e9bereau as part of a [[Jacques Chirac#Chirac's second ministry|second Chirac government's]] [[privatization]] policy.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/bnp-paribas-group-history/ |title=BNP Paribas Group History |publisher=St James Press |journal=International Directory of Company Histories |volume=36 |year=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043527/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/bnp-paribas-group-history/ |archivedate=4 April 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnpparibas.co.uk/en/bnp-paribas/bnp-paribas-group/history-of-the-group/ |title=The BNP Paribas Group \u2013 History of the Group |publisher=BNP Paribas |accessdate=15 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914130905/http://www.bnpparibas.co.uk/en/bnp-paribas/bnp-paribas-group/history-of-the-group/ |archivedate=14 September 2013  }}</ref>\n\n====Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)====\n{{See also|Paribas|Bischoffsheim family}}\n[[Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas]] ([[Paribas]]) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of ''Banque de Cr\u00e9dit et de D\u00e9p\u00f4t des Pays-Bas'', which had been established in 1820 by [[Louis-Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]] in Amsterdam, and ''Banque de Paris'', which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.\n\nDuring the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the [[First World War]] and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the [[Great Depression]]. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.\n\nAfter World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an [[investment bank]] and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as [[Groupe Bull]] and [[Thomson-CSF]].\n\nThe bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of [[Pierre Mauroy]] under [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac government]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture.  This included selling the [[Ottoman Bank]] to [[Do\u011fu\u015f Holding]], and setting up the joint venture lending company [[Cetelem]] in Germany.  It sold [[Cr\u00e9dit du Nord]] to [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and in 1998 it merged with ''Compagnie Bancaire'', renaming the bank with the official name ''Compagnie Financi\u00e8re de Paribas''.\n\n===Founding of BNP Paribas===\nIn 1999, BNP and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 23 May 2000.\n\nOn 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it.  This day is now generally seen as the start of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|credit crisis]] and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as [[UBS]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7922946/BNP-Paribas-makes-first-asset-write-back-since-2007.html| title=BNP Paribas makes first asset write back since 2007| author=Harry Wilson| date=3 August 2010| accessdate=6 April 2011| work=The Telegraph| location=London| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121102607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7922946/BNP-Paribas-makes-first-asset-write-back-since-2007.html| archivedate=21 November 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=Market Watch| author=Morning Zhou| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-stocks-may-fall-on-credit-woes-global-selloff?siteid=rss| title=Asian stocks may fall on credit woes, global sell-off| date=9 August 2007| accessdate=6 April 2011| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607102347/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-stocks-may-fall-on-credit-woes-global-selloff?siteid=rss| archivedate=7 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]]' activities in [[Belgium]], and 66% in [[Luxembourg]], in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder.

After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as [[Ageas]], a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia.

The group also owns an American subsidiary [[BancWest]] which operates as [[Bank of the West]] in the western United States. Previously the retail subsidiary operated [[First Hawaiian Bank]], a position that BNP Paribas fully exited in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://group.bnpparibas/en/press-release/secondary-offering-hawaiian-common-stock|title=Last Secondary Offering of First Hawaiian Common Stock - BNP Paribas|work=BNP Paribas|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-US}}</ref> BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.\n\nBNP Paribas is the largest bank in the [[Eurozone]] by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to ''[[The Banker]]'' magazine, just behind [[Banco Santander]]. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.\n\n====Domestic markets====\n* France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 [[automated teller machine|ATMs]]. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of \u20ac6.1&nbsp;billion (15.2% of total group's), income of \u20ac1.5&nbsp;billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://invest.bnpparibas.com/en/pid748/registrationdocument.html|title=Annual Registration Document 2009|date=11 March 2010|publisher=BNP Paribas|accessdate=17 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802071353/http://invest.bnpparibas.com/en/pid748/registrationdocument.html|archivedate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro|Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)]], Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed \u20ac2.9&nbsp;billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and \u20ac540&nbsp;million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\"/>\n* Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired [[BNP Paribas Fortis]] when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the \"Europe Mediterranean\" division.\n\n====United States====\nIn the United States, BNP Paribas owns [[BancWest]], which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries [[Bank of the West]] and previously operated [[First Hawaiian Bank]]. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest foreign bank by assets), while [[First Hawaiian Bank|First Hawaiian]] is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.\n\nThe two banks were merged into BancWest in 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.\n\nThe group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had \u20ac2.1&nbsp;billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).<ref name=\"Annual Registration Document 2009\"/> BancWest lost \u20ac223&nbsp;million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in California, [[Arizona]], and [[Nevada]].\n\n====Emerging markets====\nIn 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its \"Emerging Markets\" group the \"Europe Mediterranean\" group. This change was made because after the integration of [[Fortis Bank]]'s Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the [[Mediterranean basin]].\n\nBNP Paribas is a member of the [[Global ATM Alliance]], a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] card or [[check card]] at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally.

The book is about a fictional day in the life of [[Marlon Bundo]], the real-life pet rabbit of [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Mike Pence]] and details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It is a loose [[parody]] of ''[[Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President]]'', another children's book featuring Marlon Bundo written by [[Charlotte Pence]] and illustrated by [[Karen Pence]].\n\nThe book and its [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]-inclusive theme was written by Jill Twiss (with Marlon Bundo credited as co-writer), who is a comedy writer for the television show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'', aiming to deride Vice President Pence over his controversial anti-LGBTQ views, such as his alleged support for [[conversion therapy]] of gay adolescents and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/john-oliver-hijacks-homophobe-mike-pences-bunny-book-wi-1823879129|title=John Oliver hijacks homophobe Mike Pence's bunny book with a better one in A Day In The Life Of Marlon Bundo|last=Perkins|first=Dennis|date=March 19, 2018|website=[[The A.V.

Alli Brydon, a freelance children's book editor, worked as a consultant and editor. The book was designed by Andrea Miller.\n\nOn the day of release, [[John Oliver]] promoted the book on ''Last Week Tonight'' at the conclusion of an episode mainly dedicated to Pence and his positions on LGBTQ issues; it became a [[bestseller]] and the No. 1 book and [[e-book]] on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] the following day.

He is the recipient of several accolades, including four [[Filmfare Awards]]. For his contributions to film, the [[Government of France]] awarded him the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] (Knight of the Order of [[Arts and letters]]) in 2013.\n\nAfter writing a television serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' (1998), and made his directorial debut with ''[[Paanch]]'', which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He then went on to direct ''[[Black Friday (2007 film)|Black Friday]]'' (2007), a film based on the [[Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts|namesake book]] by [[Hussain Zaidi]] about the [[1993 Bombay bombings]]. Its release was held up for two years by the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] because of the pending verdict of the case at that time, but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's followup, ''[[No Smoking (2007 film)|No Smoking]]'' (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture ''[[Dev.D]]'' (2009), a modern adaptation of [[Devdas]] was a critical and commercial success; followed by the political drama ''[[Gulaal (film)|Gulaal]]'' (2009), and the thriller ''[[That Girl in Yellow Boots]]'' (2011).\n\nKashyap's prominence increased with the two-part [[Crime film|crime drama]], ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur]]'' (2012). Kashyap subsequently co-produced the critically acclaimed drama ''[[The Lunchbox]]'', and the biographical drama ''[[Shahid (film)|Shahid]]'' (both 2013), the former earned him a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] nomination. His next films were the anthology ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' (2013), and the drama ''[[Ugly (film)|Ugly]]'' (2014). In 2016, Kashyap directed ''[[Raman Raghav 2.0]]'', a film based on the serial killer [[Raman Raghav]]. His next film was the sports drama ''[[Mukkabaaz]]'', which was released in 2018. The same year, he co-directed India's first [[Netflix#Netflix Originals|Netflix Original series]], the crime thriller ''[[Sacred Games (TV series)|Sacred Games]]'', based on [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]]'s [[Sacred Games (novel)|novel of the same name]] and the romantic drama ''[[Manmarziyaan]]''. He was the co-founder of two film production companies: [[Anurag Kashyap Films]] and [[Phantom Films]].\n\n==Early life==\nKashyap was born on 10 September 1972 in [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/anurag-kashyap-birthday-special-the-unlucky-love-life-of-the-renowned-filmmaker/1134615|title=Anurag Kashyap birthday special: The unlucky love life of the renowned filmmaker|last=Sonar|first=Mamta|work=[[The Free Press Journal]]|date=10 September 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107002508/http://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/anurag-kashyap-birthday-special-the-unlucky-love-life-of-the-renowned-filmmaker/1134615|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anurag Kashyap turns 41; finds birthday wishes awkward |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-anurag-kashyap-turns-41-finds-birthday-wishes-awkward-1886989 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024160837/http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-anurag-kashyap-turns-41-finds-birthday-wishes-awkward-1886989 |archivedate=24 October 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Anurag Kashyap, the Godfather |author=Parul Khanna |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/anurag-kashyap-the-godfather/story-SW0CUzKTN8ElmqC7WKjPxL.html |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307211852/http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/anurag-kashyap-the-godfather/story-SW0CUzKTN8ElmqC7WKjPxL.html |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His father Sri Prakash Singh is a retired Chief Engineer of the [[Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited]] and was posted in [[Obra Thermal Power Station]] in [[Sonbhadra district]] near [[Varanasi]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Clear light of day |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main8.asp?filename=hub112704clear_light.asp |work=[[Tehelka]] |date=27 November 2004 |accessdate=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023929/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main8.asp?filename=hub112704clear_light.asp |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> He did his early schooling in Green School [[Dehradun]] and, age eight onwards, at the [[Scindia School]] in [[Gwalior]].

He is the recipient of several accolades, including four [[Filmfare Awards]]. For his contributions to film, the [[Government of France]] awarded him the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] (Knight of the Order of [[Arts and letters]]) in 2013.\n\nAfter writing a television serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' (1998), and made his directorial debut with ''[[Paanch]]'', which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He then went on to direct ''[[Black Friday (2007 film)|Black Friday]]'' (2007), a film based on the [[Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts|namesake book]] by [[Hussain Zaidi]] about the [[1993 Bombay bombings]]. Its release was held up for two years by the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] because of the pending verdict of the case at that time, but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's followup, ''[[No Smoking (2007 film)|No Smoking]]'' (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture ''[[Dev.D]]'' (2009), a modern adaptation of [[Devdas]] was a critical and commercial success; followed by the political drama ''[[Gulaal (film)|Gulaal]]'' (2009), and the thriller ''[[That Girl in Yellow Boots]]'' (2011).\n\nKashyap's prominence increased with the two-part [[Crime film|crime drama]], ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur]]'' (2012). Kashyap subsequently co-produced the critically acclaimed drama ''[[The Lunchbox]]'', and the biographical drama ''[[Shahid (film)|Shahid]]'' (both 2013), the former earned him a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] nomination. His next films were the anthology ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' (2013), and the drama ''[[Ugly (film)|Ugly]]'' (2014). In 2016, Kashyap directed ''[[Raman Raghav 2.0]]'', a film based on the serial killer [[Raman Raghav]]. His next film was the sports drama ''[[Mukkabaaz]]'', which was released in 2018.

The District of Columbia is a [[federal district]] under the direct jurisdiction of the [[United States Congress]]. Statehood would grant the District [[District of Columbia voting rights|voting representation]] in the Congress and [[District of Columbia home rule|full control over local affairs]].

However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the [[seat of government|seat of the United States federal government]].\n\nIf the District of Columbia were to become a state \u2013 based on 2018 figures \u2013 it would rank [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|49th by population]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|51st by area]], [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|1st by GDP per capita]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by income|1st by median household income]], and [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|34th by total GDP]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] has designed this 51-star version of the national flag for use in the event that a [[51st state]] is admitted into the Union.]]\n\n===District Clause of the Constitution===\nIn 1783, a crowd of disbanded Revolutionary War soldiers angry about not having been paid gathered to [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|protest outside the building]] where the [[Continental Congress]] was meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790. That land was [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|returned to Virginia]] in 1847. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

In 1801, [[Augustus Woodward]] writing under the name Epaminondes, wrote a series of newspaper articles in the National Intelligencer proposing a constitutional amendment that would read \"The Territory of Columbia shall be entitled to one Senator in the Senate of the United States; and to a number of members in the House of Representatives proportionate to its population.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Augustus|title=Considerations on the government of the Territory of Columbia : as they appeared in the National intelligencer|date=1801|publisher=Samuel Harrison Smith|location=Washington, DC}}</ref> Since then more than 150 constitutional amendments  and bills have been introduced to provide representation to the District of Columbia, resulting in congressional hearings on more than twenty occasions, with the first of those hearings in 1803.<ref name=Hatch>{{cite journal|last1=Hatch|first1=Orrin|title=Should the Capital Vote in Congress?

Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that DC be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. [[Wesley Livsey Jones]] (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in successful passage of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] in 1961, which granted the District votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state. This right has been exercised by D.C. citizens since the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]].\n\nWith District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, for a House floor for a vote in 1976 and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]. But that amendment expired in 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38.\n\n===Statehood movement, 1980s and beyond===\n[[File:DC statehood now flag at Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|DC Statehood Now! flag at [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration 2013]]]]\n\nBefore the failure of the Voting Rights Amendment, but when passage seemed unlikely, District voters finally began to pursue statehood. In 1980, District voters approved the call of a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to draft a proposed [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms2094.xml |title=GUIDE TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STATEHOOD CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION RECORDS, 1982 |website=Library.gwu.edu |accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> just as U.S. territories had done prior to their admission as states.

The U.S. Constitution requires that any new states formed from an existing state receive permission from the legislature. Since Maryland granted land to form the national capital and not a new state, some lawmakers have concluded that Maryland must also consent to the new state.<ref name=\"Health1987\">{{cite book|last=Health|first=United States.

This is inconsistent with being on equal footing with all other states. The statehood legislation supported by the District government and some House Democrats gets around this by carving out an [[enclave]] within the proposed state, encompassing the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]], and other major federal offices, to act as the new District of Columbia for constitutional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://statehood.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/statehood/page_content/attachments/HR-1291.pdf |title=H.

Most proposals generally involve either treating the District of Columbia more like a state or allowing Maryland to take back the land it donated to form the District.\n\nIf both Congress and the Maryland General Assembly agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland or given to Virginia if the state legislature of Virginia agreed, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the [[United States Capitol]], the [[White House]] and the Supreme Court building.

However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the [[seat of government|seat of the United States federal government]].\n\nIf the District of Columbia were to become a state \u2013 based on 2018 figures \u2013 it would rank [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|49th by population]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|51st by area]], [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|1st by GDP per capita]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by income|1st by median household income]], and [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|34th by total GDP]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] has designed this 51-star version of the national flag for use in the event that a [[51st state]] is admitted into the Union.]]\n\n===District Clause of the Constitution===\nIn 1783, a crowd of disbanded Revolutionary War soldiers angry about not having been paid gathered to [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|protest outside the building]] where the [[Continental Congress]] was meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790. That land was [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|returned to Virginia]] in 1847. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that DC be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. [[Wesley Livsey Jones]] (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in successful passage of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] in 1961, which granted the District votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state. This right has been exercised by D.C. citizens since the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]].\n\nWith District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, for a House floor for a vote in 1976 and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]. But that amendment expired in 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38.\n\n===Statehood movement, 1980s and beyond===\n[[File:DC statehood now flag at Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|DC Statehood Now! flag at [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration 2013]]]]\n\nBefore the failure of the Voting Rights Amendment, but when passage seemed unlikely, District voters finally began to pursue statehood.

It would also be the only state to have no rural residents and thus no need to consider the interests of non-urban areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/28/AR2007032801879.html|title=The Seat Congress Can't Offer|first=George F.|last=Will|date=March 29, 2007|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Some have expressed concern that the newly formed state might enact a [[commuter tax]] on non-residents that work in the District; such a tax is currently illegal under the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act]].<ref>Eric M.

The U.S. Constitution requires that any new states formed from an existing state receive permission from the legislature. Since Maryland granted land to form the national capital and not a new state, some lawmakers have concluded that Maryland must also consent to the new state.<ref name=\"Health1987\">{{cite book|last=Health|first=United States.

This is inconsistent with being on equal footing with all other states. The statehood legislation supported by the District government and some House Democrats gets around this by carving out an [[enclave]] within the proposed state, encompassing the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]], and other major federal offices, to act as the new District of Columbia for constitutional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://statehood.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/statehood/page_content/attachments/HR-1291.pdf |title=H.

Most proposals generally involve either treating the District of Columbia more like a state or allowing Maryland to take back the land it donated to form the District.\n\nIf both Congress and the Maryland General Assembly agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland or given to Virginia if the state legislature of Virginia agreed, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the [[United States Capitol]], the [[White House]] and the Supreme Court building.

The primary issue with all legislative proposals is whether the Congress has the constitutional authority to grant the District voting representation.

The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ([[Bersih]]), was supported by [[Pakatan Rakyat]], the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia, but was deemed illegal by the government. Bersih, chaired by former president of the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]], were pushing the [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) to ensure free and fair elections in Malaysia. It demanded that the EC clean up the electoral roll, reform postal voting, use indelible ink, introduce a minimum 21-day campaign period, allow all parties free access to the media, and put an end to electoral fraud.\n\nThe [[Royal Malaysia Police|police]] vowed to stop any rallies from taking place on the planned date on the grounds that all public gatherings without police permits are illegal. Having originally planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at [[Stadium Merdeka|Merdeka Stadium]] after consultations with the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], Malaysia's head of state.\n\nSupporters of Bersih claim that demands for electoral reform made during the 2007 demonstration fell on deaf ears. [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] Youth and [[Perkasa]] planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit.\n\nEstimates of the turnout ranged between 10,000 and over 20,000.

The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ([[Bersih]]), was supported by [[Pakatan Rakyat]], the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia, but was deemed illegal by the government. Bersih, chaired by former president of the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]], were pushing the [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) to ensure free and fair elections in Malaysia. It demanded that the EC clean up the electoral roll, reform postal voting, use indelible ink, introduce a minimum 21-day campaign period, allow all parties free access to the media, and put an end to electoral fraud.\n\nThe [[Royal Malaysia Police|police]] vowed to stop any rallies from taking place on the planned date on the grounds that all public gatherings without police permits are illegal. Having originally planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at [[Stadium Merdeka|Merdeka Stadium]] after consultations with the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], Malaysia's head of state.\n\nSupporters of Bersih claim that demands for electoral reform made during the 2007 demonstration fell on deaf ears. [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] Youth and [[Perkasa]] planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit.\n\nEstimates of the turnout ranged between 10,000 and over 20,000. The protesters were unable to congregate at Merdeka Stadium as many were forced to disperse by police who were heavily deployed throughout the city. Police arrested more than 1600 protesters, including [[Ambiga Sreenevasan|Ambiga]] and several opposition figures.\n\n==Background==\nThe ruling coalition in Malaysia, [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN), which consists of parties representing the major racial groups in Malaysia, has won every federal election since independence in 1957.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia set for general election |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7283239.stm |work=BBC News   |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}</ref> Opposition parties and civil society organisations have long claimed that BN has been manipulating elections in its favour.<ref name=\"walk\"/><ref name=\"polact\"/><ref name=\"kok\"/><ref name=\"anwar1\"/><ref name=\"aliran\"/><ref name=\"upper\"/><ref name=\"trans\"/>\n\n[[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) deputy president [[Mohamad Sabu]] said there were many \"concerns\" about how the [[Next Malaysian general election|next general election]] will be conducted.

A leader of the National Council of Romanian Women and the Association of Romanian Women, she served as Vice President of the [[International Council of Women]], representing the [[International Alliance of Women]], as well as Romania, to the [[League of Nations]]. However, her feminist beliefs and international profile clashed with her [[national conservatism]], her support for [[eugenics]], and eventually her conversion to [[fascism]].\n\nCantacuzino was a member of Romanian nobility, and, after her marriage to the wealthy landowner [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino]], claimed the title of \"Princess\". Her [[elitism]] and her feminism led her to join the upper-class charity SONFR, of which she became President after [[World War I]]. A wartime nurse, she became a herald of war remembrance initiatives (responsible, in large part, for the [[Mausoleum of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]]). After her involvement with the National Council of Romanian Women, she supported limited [[women's suffrage]] within a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] framework, losing the support of liberal women, but also building connections with fascist politicians. Cantacuzino's policies within the Association of Romanian Women were mirrored in the legislation of [[World War II]] fascist regimes, beginning with the [[National Renaissance Front]].\n\nSympathetic toward the revolutionary fascist [[Iron Guard]], of which her son Alecu was also an affiliate, Cantacuzino switched her support toward [[Ion Antonescu]]'s government in early 1941. Having earlier reported to the League of Nations on the damages caused by the [[Spanish Civil War]], she was also critical of Antonescu over the [[1941 Odessa massacre]]. This was her last known public cause. Cantacuzino died, in relative obscurity, not long after [[King Michael's Coup|Antonescu's downfall]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nAlexandra Pallady, also known under the pet name ''Didina'', was born in [[Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti, D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba|Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti]], a village currently in [[D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County]] (but, in 1876, still part of [[Ilfov County]]).<ref name=\"rche89\">Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89</ref> Her birth date is known to have been September 20, 1876,<ref name=\"rche89\"/> but other sources credit it as 1877 or 1881.<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\">{{in lang|ro}} Marian Pruteanu, [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/discursuridesprefemeie.htm \"Discursuri despre femeie \u00een Rom\u00e2nia dintre cele dou\u0103 r\u0103zboaie mondiale\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220102828/http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/discursuridesprefemeie.htm |date=2014-02-20 }}, in Alin Ciupal\u0103, ''Despre femei \u0219i istoria lor \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'', [[Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii Bucure\u0219ti]], Bucharest, 2004 ([http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/ e-book version] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309113036/http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/ |date=2014-03-09 }} at the [[University of Bucharest]]; retrieved March 8, 2014)</ref> She was by birth a member of the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] upper-class: her father, Lieutenant Colonel Theodor Pallady (1847/1853\u20131916), an aristocrat from the eastern region (and former state) of [[Moldavia]], had earned distinction in the [[Romanian Land Forces]]; her mother, also named Alexandrina (1845/1848\u20131881), was a Kretzulescu boyaress from [[Wallachia]], and the heiress of a large estate.<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89; Ion, p.276</ref> Through Pallady's mother, Alexandrina descended from another boyar house, the [[Ghica family|Ghicas]], who owned the manor in Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti.<ref>Ion, p.276.

In 1910, Alexandrina joined a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] philanthropic society, the [[National Orthodox Society of Romanian Women]] (''[[Societatea Ortodox\u0103 Na\u021bional\u0103 a Femeilor Rom\u00e2ne]]'', SONFR). While she is most often credited as a founding member,<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/><ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90; Ciupal\u0103, p.89</ref> the Society might have existed under a different name as early as 1893, with Ecaterina Cantacuzino, Gheorghe's wife, as its President.<ref name=\"gefil6\">Filitti, p.6</ref>\n\nThe central core of SONFR was a group of high-society ladies, including Alexandrina Cantacuzino and, among others, Zoe R\u00e2mniceanu, Elena Odobescu, Anastasia Filipescu, Maria Glagoveanu, Sultana Miclescu and Zetta Manu.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86, 89, 137</ref> As indicated by the name, SONFR was situated on the conservative right of Romanian feminism, where it \"reinforced women's traditional roles as mothers and wives\",<ref name=\"mb (03)64\">Bucur (2003), p.64</ref> being entirely apolitical.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.94; Filitti, p.6</ref> However, the Society was soon involved in a number of adjacent projects, such as disseminating propaganda among the Romanians of [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]], and other parts of [[Austria-Hungary]], and circulating letters of protest against [[Magyarization]].<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.87-88</ref>\n\nAlthough SONFR was sponsored by \"the Nawab\" and other mainline Conservatives, such ideological positions resonated with the National Liberal program of [[Spiru Haret]], the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Minister]], who offered his full support.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.89-90</ref> With such sources of revenue, supplemented by bank loans and private donations, SONFR established two girls' schools, 17 [[kindergarten]]s (the first of which was in [[Doroban\u021bi]]), and 22 public libraries.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.90-94</ref> Some of its funds went directly into purchasing land for Romanian peasant communities in Transylvania and elsewhere, with schools being built as far afield as [[Chernivtsi|Chernowitz]], [[Geaca]], and [[Markovac (Vr\u0161ac)|Markovac]].<ref name=\"gefil6\"/>\n\nSONFR's more formal mission was to combat \"foreign religious propaganda\" and \"the foreign educational establishments\", which it described as sources of corruption for young Romanian women.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86</ref> According to historian Alin Ciupal\u0103, these goals should be seen as reflecting the \"borderline intolerant\" position of Romanian Orthodoxy, but not particularly conclusive at that: \"We believe that SONFR's would-be alliance with the Church determined the adoption by the Ladies' Society leadership of ideas circulated by some Orthodox [[Ordinary (officer)|hierarchs]], especially those concerning Catholicism, but mostly with a tactical goal in mind. [...] Moreover, one might mention here the organizers' intent to make use, as it did, of the Church-controlled, nation-wide, infrastructure: the priests as instruments for propaganda and the influence, not just moral, of the leading Orthodox hierarchs.\"<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86-87</ref>\n\nSONFR members included liberal [[suffragette]]s, such as [[Calypso Botez]]; Cantacuzino herself was less clearly affiliated with this current, although she did describe herself a \"feminist\".<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/><ref name=\"mb (03)64\"/> As noted by gender historian Roxana Che\u0219chebec, Cantacuzino was primarily an [[Elitism|elitist]], who believed in fulfilling a \"historic mission of the upper classes\", focusing on assisting \"the socially disadvantaged as a way of serving the country and the nation.\"<ref name=\"rche90\">Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90</ref> The same is noted by Pruteanu, who also records her claim that Romanian nobility lived \"outside the murderous luxury that surrounds us.\"<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/> Pruteanu believes that Cantacuzino was \"confused\", with \"a fractured identity\", forever oscillating between \"conformism and rebellion.\"<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in 1913, Grigore was appointed [[Mayor of Bucharest]] in the wake of the \"Tramcar Affair\", which had besmirched the opposition [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]. According to contemporary sources, he owed his appointment exclusively to \"the Nawab\", who was at the time performing his last official function, that of [[President of the Senate of Romania|Senate President]].<ref>Bacalba\u0219a, p.105, 124-125, 152, 154</ref> The immensely large Cantacuzino estate was split between the two sons, both of whom used the [[Cantacuzino Castle|Zamora Castle]] of [[Bu\u0219teni]].

From 1914 to the summer of 1916, the National Liberal cabinet of [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] preserved the country's neutrality (''see [[Romania during World War I]]''). Public opinion became sharply divided among supporters of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and the \"[[Germanophile]]s\"\u2014who favored the [[Central Powers]], particularly [[German Empire|Germany]]. Grigore Cantacuzino oscillated between the two sides, but his two newspapers, ''Minerva'' and ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', were closely associated with Germanophilia.<ref>Boia, p.94, 191</ref> In September 1914, they were bought from him by a German consortium, and became the mouthpieces of German propaganda.<ref>Boia, p.94</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|1916 Treaty]] with the Entente, [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] and Premier Br\u0103tianu agreed to join the war against the Central Powers. This had the effect of silencing Germanophile dissidence. Alexandrina volunteered for work as a nurse.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.114</ref> In August 1916, she became manager of the No. 113 Hospital, set up at the SONFR Institute in Bucharest with funds from the [[National Bank of Romania]] (her assistant managers were Elena Odobescu and Elena Perticari).<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.94</ref> By the end of the year, however, the Romanian Army was on the retreat everywhere, with the Germans [[Battle of Bucharest|in sight of Bucharest]]. King and government followed the Army retreat into Moldavia, where they remained besieged until 1918. The invasion further divided the Cantacuzino family, between those who aligned themselves with the German regime in Bucharest, and those who, as loyalists, fought against the Germans in Moldavia.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.114-115</ref> The Zamora Castle was requisitioned by the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]], serving as residence for the Governor, [[August von Mackensen]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Robert Boucard, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k602720m/f2.image \"Un r\u00e9ception chez la princesse Cantacuz\u00e8ne, VIII\"], in ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]'', October 27, 1927, p.2 (digitized by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])</ref>\n\nGrigore was an associate of the Germanophile administration set up by [[Lupu Kostaki]] in Bucharest, but moreover a confidant of the skeptical Conservative [[Alexandru Marghiloman]]. Together with Marghiloman and others, he stood up to the Germans when it came to providing for civilian needs, such as when he procured firewood for the Bucharest populace.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.68-69</ref> Reportedly, he also took a mediating position between Marghiloman, who remained respectful of King Ferdinand, and [[Petre P. Carp]], who wanted the dynasty ousted and replaced.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.74-75</ref>\n\nWith Marghiloman as President of the [[Romanian Red Cross]], Alexandrina became a member of the Red Cross \"Ladies' Committee\", working to provide humanitarian assistance for the prisoners-of-war in Romania and abroad.<ref>Dr. Metzulescu, \"Pre\u0219edintele Crucii Ro\u0219ii\", in ''Lui Alexandru Marghiloman, omagiu cu prilejul unei \u00eendoite aniversari: prietenii \u0219i admiratorii lui'', [[Editura Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103]], Bucharest, 1924, p.107-114</ref> Her political attitudes at the time remain a mystery, with the exception of her belief that \"a new world shall rise from the bloodied humanity\"\u2014not as an endorsement of political revolution, but as a trust in the ethnic Romanian capacity for work and rejuvenation.<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/>\n\nOn several occasions, Cantacuzino stood up to the German authorities and protected SONFR's interests, usually with significant success.<ref name=\"gefil7\">Filitti, p.7</ref> SONFR was involved in smuggling recovering Romanian soldiers back into the Moldavian free zone.<ref name=\"mb (03)64\"/> The hospital she managed was eventually evicted by the Germans, and Alexandrina published a letter a protest; she and her husband also spoke up in favor of [[Conon Ar\u0103mescu-Donici|Conon]], the [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Metropolitan Bishop]], who was being pressured into handing in the church administration to Mariu Theodorian-Carada, a Catholic.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26, 34-35</ref> Such shows of dissent almost led to Alexandrina's own imprisonment in a German camp.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26-27; Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90</ref> \n\n===Marghiloman government===\nAlexandrina returned to work at the hospital. She decided to hold a banquet there in honor of [[Alexandru D. Sturdza]] and other defectors from the loyalist Romanian Army. The affair ended in a brawl between the party guests and the inmates-patients they ran into.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.107-108</ref> In late 1917, with the fall of its [[Russian Republic]]an backers, the Br\u0103tianu administration collapsed in Moldavia, leaving Ferdinand to ponder an [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|armistice with the Germans]]. In Bucharest, the Marghiloman Conservatives created their own Legislative Commission, with the aim of achieving peace and reconciliation; Grigore Cantacuzino was among its members, but failed to win appointment in the subsequent Marghiloman Cabinet.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.79-81</ref> \n\nThe year 1918 ended in unexpected defeat for the Germanophiles: the [[First Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|November Armistice]] signaled a sudden victory for the Entente Powers, and instantly brought the fall of Marghiloman's administration. Alexandrina Cantacuzino, who witnessed the events, mediated between the disgraced Marghiloman and General [[Alexandru Averescu]], the King's favorite minister, circulating rumors that Romania was prey to [[revolutionary socialism]].<ref>Marghiloman, p.184-185</ref> Organizing the welcome-back celebrations for [[Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Marie]], she also urged Marghiloman to stay indoors, because the Entente's military mission and the general populace wished to avoid him.<ref>Marghiloman, p.155, 162</ref> As a tribute to her patriotic actions, Cantacuzino was elected SONFR president in 1918; she would lead the Society until 1938.<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89, 90</ref> \n\nSabina Cantacuzino, Br\u0103tianu's sister and an in-law of Alexandrina's, observed her recovery from the side. In her memoirs, published in 1937, she accuses Alexandrina of staging \"an advertisement\". In her view, the SONFR leader making \"a public show\" of her compassion toward Romanian soldiers, while secure in the knowledge that Grigore Cantacuzino was in favor with the Germans.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.84</ref> Such claims are also found in the diaries of Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu (Br\u0103tianu's daughter and Sabina's niece), who additionally writes that \"Didina\" enjoyed \"hunting with the hounds and running with the hare\".<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26, 107</ref> These views were met with opprobrium upon publishing: Sabina's work was dismissed as a libelous sample of Br\u0103tianu's \"monopoly on patriotism\".<ref>Bucur (2010), p.84. See also Podgoreanu & Costache, p.121-122</ref>\n\nThe Conservative Party was in disarray, losing its members in droves. Marghiloman held on to the unpopular \"Conservative\" title (later \"Conservative-Progressive\"), while Grigore Cantacuzino advised in favor of reforming it as a \"Constitutional Party\", or merging it into Averescu's more successful [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]].<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.88-89, 90-91, 119-120</ref> The brothers' \"Cantacuzino Conservative\" group became a virtually independent faction, sometimes in rebellion against Marghiloman's orders, and sympathetic to the breakaway [[Conservative-Democratic Party]].<ref>Marghiloman, p.126-127, 134, 144, 225, 232, 244, 265-266, 322, 345, 371, 392</ref> However, both Grigore and Marghiloman were horrified by the promise of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], and, contrary to the moderate Conservatives, wanted the party to represent, as before 1914, the interests of landowners.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.90-91</ref>\n\n===CNFR creation and SONFR presidency===\nAfter the creation of [[Greater Romania]], SONFR negotiated its collaboration with the secular wing of the women's movement. Cantacuzino herself became a member of the nation-wide Association for the Civil and Political Emancipation of Romanian Women (AECPFR), and unsuccessfully tried to absorb the smaller League for Women's Rights and Duties (LDDF) into SONFR.<ref name=\"rche90\"/> In June 1919, she was also elected honorary president of the female section within the \"Cross Brotherhood\", founded by right-wing nationalist [[Amos Fr\u00e2ncu]] at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]].<ref>Cor., \"Constituirea 'Fr\u0103\u021biilor de cruce' \u0219i Cununa surorilor de cruce din Cluj\", in ''Rom\u00e2nul (Arad)'', Nr.

As Che\u0219chebec notes, such women intellectuals \"aimed to appease fears of the destructive potential of feminist 'individualism', offering the 'acceptable' and 'nationally authentic' face of Romanian feminism.\" Their publicity efforts were fruitless, since: \"despite ideological differences, all feminists aimed to alter the traditional family order. This common feature blurred the differences between various strands of feminism.\"<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2012), p.365</ref>\n\nFor Cantacuzino, Romanian Orthodoxy was \"the blessed shield of the Romanian nation\", with priests and women holding complementary positions as defenders of traditional life.<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/> At SONFR, where she still invested most of her efforts,<ref name=\"rche90\"/> she tackled generic Orthodox causes, such as taking sides with [[Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople|Meletius IV]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], in his conflict with [[Government of the Grand National Assembly|Kemalist Turkey]].<ref>[[Catherine Durandin]], \"Orthodoxie et Roumanit\u00e9: Le d\u00e9bat de l'entre deux guerres\", in [[Keith Hitchins]] (ed.), ''Rumanian Studies.

In the realm of feminism, Cantacuzino rose to the position of CNFR President. This followed the protest resignation of Calypso Botez, part of an anti-Cantacuzino schism inside the CNFR.<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.91; Daskalova, p.191</ref> Also in 1930, Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino died, leaving Alexandrina a widow. She never remarried.<ref name=\"rche89\"/>\n\nOver several years, Alexandrina Cantacuzino's nationalism mutated into [[authoritarianism]]. By then, the apparent successes of [[Italian fascism]], which probably impressed Cantacuzino during her visit to Rome,<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> had widened the fault line in the Romanian feminist movement. Cantacuzino was won over by the fascist critique of [[liberal democracy]], and, while still a feminist, began voicing support for an alternative to Romania's own liberal regime. Cantacuzino envisaged a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] monarchy, campaigned for a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] public administration service, and favored [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] the poorly educated males (while enfranchising educated women).<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2012), p.367-368</ref> \n\nAs argued by Alexandra Petrescu, the GFR's ideology mutated into the \"[[Pan-Latinism|Latin]]\" feminism promoted, on occasion, by [[Benito Mussolini]] himself, with its vision of Latin women as equal combatants in a corporatist revolution.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> This switch in allegiance was occurring just as the Little Entente of Women began fading into insignificance. Cantacuzino was vehemently opposed to the other delegates, including Greece's [[Avra Theodoropoulou]], over the issue of admitting women from [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Single-party period of the Republic of Turkey|Republican Turkey]] and [[Kingdom of Albania (1928\u201339)|Albania]].<ref>Daskalova, p.194</ref>\n\nThe GFR, unlike all other feminist groups, banned women from enlisting in party politics, but encouraged them to run in municipal elections as they pleased.<ref name=\"rche92\"/><ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> According to Petrescu, this demand should be contrasted with the GFR's structure and goals, which, she argues, are those of an informal political party.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Cantacuzino voiced her ideas in the GFR and CNFR petitions of December 1930 and March 1932, while also asking that representatives of women's organizations be assigned seats in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]].<ref name=\"rche(12)367\"/> In 1933, she spoke in front of GFR members about the corporatist \"reconstruction\" of Romania, drafting out her own project for senatorial \"corporatist elections\" by men- and women-electors.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> The immediate effect of such interventions was the creation of a GFR youth wing, ''Tinerele Grupiste'', likely modeled on Italy's ''[[Gruppo Universitario Fascista]]'' (but, unlike it, focused only on campaigns for [[Women in the workforce|female employment]]).<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/>\n\nResearchers are divided when it comes to evaluating the actual appeal of Cantacuzino's nationalist feminism. Bucur writes that \"most feminists, like Alexandrina Cantacuzino, were also aggressive, even jingoistic nationalists\".<ref>Bucur (2010), p.279</ref> Contrarily, Petrescu notes: \"Alexandrina Cantacuzino is the interwar's only feminist to have let herself be seduced by authoritarianism.\"<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> The AECPFR and other organizations repudiated Cantacuzino, declaring themselves for emancipation within the format of liberal democracy.<ref name=\"rche(12)368\">Che\u0219chebec (2012), p.368</ref> Occasionally, Cantacuzino herself still showed interest in the development of democratic societies: a guest of the Friends of America society on [[Washington's Birthday]], 1932, she lectured about \"Different Aspects of American Life and Culture\".<ref>\"Rumania\", in ''History of the George Washington Bicentennial Celebration.

This [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] wing of SONFR resigned in 1934, after Cantacuzino refused to testify, under oath, that she was not a covert [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemason]].<ref name=\"gefil7\"/>\n\nBy 1937, in tune with the [[National Christian Party]] regime, Cantacuzino had embraced [[eugenics]], [[racism]], and [[antisemitism]]. At a meeting in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], she proposed the introduction of legislation banning all \"foreigners\" and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all [[Romanian nationality law|Romanian citizenship applications]].<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for \"eugenic\" marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, [[C\u00e9cile Brunschvicg]] inquired: \"there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] spirit in your country.

She was not a GFR appointee, but rather an old AECPFR combatant.<ref name=\"rche(12)368\"/> For her part, Cantacuzino still held diplomatic assignments at the League of Nations, this time representing the Romanian government. She was tasked with improving the livelihoods of children and women affected by the [[Spanish Civil War]], proposing the creation of [[Demilitarized zone|neutral zones]] for children, and working on an internationally valid Children's Charter.<ref name=\"rche92\"/>\n\nThere were already signs that a rift was occurring between King Carol and the fascist feminists. In September 1938, Cantacuzino was a guest of honor at the [[Mausoleum of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] inauguration, where she spoke about SONFR's contribution to the \"eternal remembrance\" of World War I heroes; she also called to memory the \"Glorious Reign\" of King Ferdinand as a \"Symbol of the Fatherland\" and \"the Soul among Souls\".<ref>Bucur (2010), p.98-99</ref> According to Bucur, the speech can be read as a jibe at both ''Cultul Eroilor'' and King Carol, whose conduct in wartime had been less than honorable.<ref name=\"mb(10)99\"/> At the GFR Congress in [[Bra\u0219ov]], Cantacuzino publicly complained that her goal of achieving women's suffrage had turned into a bitter victory.<ref name=\"rche(12)368\"/>\n\nIt is unclear whether or not she supported the [[Iron Guard]],<ref name=\"rche92\"/> a rival, largely underground, fascist movement.

In a 1937 letter (recovered and published in 2005), General Cantacuzino-Gr\u0103nicerul threatens Alexandrina to stop intervening between him, Alecu, and Codreanu, accusing her of having \"filled our Orthodox schools with kikes\" and of \"preach[ing] an entente with the enemies of the people.\"<ref name=\"gefil7\"/>\n\nBefore the close of 1938, King Carol's police forces clamped down on the Iron Guard, and killed Codreanu in custody. Alexandrina was placed her under surveillance, suspected of having helped the outlawed movement,<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.92; Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.298</ref> while her GFR and ''Tinerele Grupiste'' were also outlawed.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Alecu was detained at the concentration camp in [[R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat]], where, unbeknown to his family, he was shot dead by the guards (September 22, 1939).<ref>Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.298, 304</ref> Around October, rumors spread that Alexandrina and her other sons were also about to be interned; the authorities eventually decided to monitor Alexandrina by placing her under house arrest.<ref>Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.297-298, 304</ref>\n\n===World War II and death===\nThe final stage of Cantacuzino's career covers saw her collateral involvement in the political upheavals of [[World War II]]. During late 1940, Carol fell from power, and the Iron Guard established its \"[[National Legionary State]]\". At its helm was an army man and political maverick, ''[[Conduc\u0103tor]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], on whose behalf Alexandrina Cantacuzino had intervened in the past.<ref name=\"ic116\">Constantin, p.116</ref> As noted by Che\u0219chebec, Alecu's killing \"apparently is not related to Cantacuzino's show of support for the legionary regime\".<ref name=\"rche92\"/> Her decision to join the Iron Guard was motivated, according to Bucur, by \"sheer opportunism or because [she] hoped to carve out a leading, powerful role in such a dynamic movement\", and most likely not by fear of reprisals.<ref>Bucur (2003), p.76-77</ref> Signs of this rapprochement are recorded in the Guard's newspapers: in 1940, ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'' published [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt]]'s interview with Cantacuzino, where she described the political role of women in the National Legionary regime.<ref>Bucur (2003), p.77</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|January 1941 battle]] between the Guard and Antonescu, which was won by the latter, Cantacuzino endured an Antonescu supporter. By June, Antonescu had agreed to participate in [[Operation Barbarossa]]: as an ally of the [[Nazi Germany]], Romania recaptured the lost province of [[Bessarabia]]. In an article for the official propaganda paper, ''[[Universul]]'', Cantacuzino celebrated \"the holy hour\" as the definitive end of \"Jewish democracy\", and envisaged a redemption of Europe under fascist rule.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Lucian Vasile, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/manipularea-presa-prima-luna-al-doilea-razboi-mondial \"Manipularea din pres\u0103 \u00een prima lun\u0103 din al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial\"], in ''Historia'', April 2011</ref> The Antonescu regime soon enforced [[racial antisemitism]] across the land. According to Alexandra Petrescu, the legislation introduced at the time was remarkably similar with the Cantacuzino project of 1937.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/>\n\nCantacuzino was not an uncritical affiliate of Antonescu's policies, as she showed during her October 1941 visit [[Odessa]], capital of newly occupied [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]]. It took place just days after the Antonescu-ordered [[1941 Odessa massacre|massacre of Odessan Jews]], of which she was informed by the [[Mayor of Odessa|City Mayor]], [[Gherman P\u00e2ntea]]. P\u00e2ntea believed the massacre to have been incidental, not deliberate. Using Cantacuzino as his messenger, asked Antonescu to punish the guilty parties and allow Jewish deportees back in Odessa.<ref>Constantin, p.114-116, 259</ref> P\u00e2ntea reports that Cantacuzino shared his belief that the massacre was going to weigh heavily on \"the entire country\", and that \"an objective inquiry\" was needed; he writes that Antonescu threatened to shoot him for disobedience, but that he changed his mind, and even that he lived to regret his order for massacre.<ref>Constantin, p.116-117</ref> Cantacuzino continued to intervene with Antonescu on other matters, such as when she obtained the naturalization of Pavel Chasovnikov, an Odessan surgeon.<ref>Constantin, p.138</ref>\n\nCantacuzino died in September, October,<ref name=\"rche92\"/> or November 1944.<ref name=\"ndi276\"/> This was closely after [[King Michael's Coup]], which had resulted in Antonescu's arrest and the denunciation of Romania's Nazi alliance. Historian Ion Constantin claims that she committed suicide, \"to avoid the torment of detention under the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]\".<ref name=\"ic116\"/> Roxana Che\u0219chebec, however, records her death cause as \"old age\".<ref name=\"rche92\"/> She was survived by Gheorghe Cantacuzino, who pursued a career in archeology, [[epigraphy]], and [[papyrology]]; he died in 1977.<ref>Constantin Preda, \"Cantacuzino, Gheorghe I.\" [''sic''], in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'', [[Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103]], Bucharest, 1978, p.80-81</ref>\n\nIn the years following Alexandrina's death, Zamora Castle was [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalized]], then assigned to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Ministry]]; reclaimed by the Cantacuzinos after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], and finally reassigned to them in 2004, it was later sold to other private owners.<ref name=\"sltcnababul\"/> The Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti manor, confiscated from Gheorghe Cantacuzino, was classified as a [[Monument istoric|historical monument]] and [[Writers Union of Romania|Writers' Union]] vacation home, but not before being thoroughly devastated by the local trade unions.<ref>Ion, p.276-281</ref> It was also nationalized in 1949, but continued to be looted after that date.<ref>Ion, p.281-282</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, ''\u00censemn\u0103ri din timpul ocupa\u021biei germane'', Independen\u021ba, Bucharest, 1929\n* [[Constantin Bacalba\u0219a]], ''Bucure\u0219tii de alt\u0103dat\u0103.

A leader of the National Council of Romanian Women and the Association of Romanian Women, she served as Vice President of the [[International Council of Women]], representing the [[International Alliance of Women]], as well as Romania, to the [[League of Nations]]. However, her feminist beliefs and international profile clashed with her [[national conservatism]], her support for [[eugenics]], and eventually her conversion to [[fascism]].\n\nCantacuzino was a member of Romanian nobility, and, after her marriage to the wealthy landowner [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino]], claimed the title of \"Princess\". Her [[elitism]] and her feminism led her to join the upper-class charity SONFR, of which she became President after [[World War I]]. A wartime nurse, she became a herald of war remembrance initiatives (responsible, in large part, for the [[Mausoleum of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]]). After her involvement with the National Council of Romanian Women, she supported limited [[women's suffrage]] within a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] framework, losing the support of liberal women, but also building connections with fascist politicians. Cantacuzino's policies within the Association of Romanian Women were mirrored in the legislation of [[World War II]] fascist regimes, beginning with the [[National Renaissance Front]].\n\nSympathetic toward the revolutionary fascist [[Iron Guard]], of which her son Alecu was also an affiliate, Cantacuzino switched her support toward [[Ion Antonescu]]'s government in early 1941. Having earlier reported to the League of Nations on the damages caused by the [[Spanish Civil War]], she was also critical of Antonescu over the [[1941 Odessa massacre]]. This was her last known public cause. Cantacuzino died, in relative obscurity, not long after [[King Michael's Coup|Antonescu's downfall]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nAlexandra Pallady, also known under the pet name ''Didina'', was born in [[Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti, D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba|Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti]], a village currently in [[D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County]] (but, in 1876, still part of [[Ilfov County]]).<ref name=\"rche89\">Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89</ref> Her birth date is known to have been September 20, 1876,<ref name=\"rche89\"/> but other sources credit it as 1877 or 1881.<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\">{{in lang|ro}} Marian Pruteanu, [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/discursuridesprefemeie.htm \"Discursuri despre femeie \u00een Rom\u00e2nia dintre cele dou\u0103 r\u0103zboaie mondiale\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220102828/http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/discursuridesprefemeie.htm |date=2014-02-20 }}, in Alin Ciupal\u0103, ''Despre femei \u0219i istoria lor \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'', [[Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii Bucure\u0219ti]], Bucharest, 2004 ([http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/ e-book version] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309113036/http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/ciupala/ |date=2014-03-09 }} at the [[University of Bucharest]]; retrieved March 8, 2014)</ref> She was by birth a member of the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] upper-class: her father, Lieutenant Colonel Theodor Pallady (1847/1853\u20131916), an aristocrat from the eastern region (and former state) of [[Moldavia]], had earned distinction in the [[Romanian Land Forces]]; her mother, also named Alexandrina (1845/1848\u20131881), was a Kretzulescu boyaress from [[Wallachia]], and the heiress of a large estate.<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89; Ion, p.276</ref> Through Pallady's mother, Alexandrina descended from another boyar house, the [[Ghica family|Ghicas]], who owned the manor in Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti.<ref>Ion, p.276.

The [[Cantacuzino family]], of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] origins, had been highly influential in the political affairs of Moldavia and Wallachia.

While she is most often credited as a founding member,<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/><ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90; Ciupal\u0103, p.89</ref> the Society might have existed under a different name as early as 1893, with Ecaterina Cantacuzino, Gheorghe's wife, as its President.<ref name=\"gefil6\">Filitti, p.6</ref>\n\nThe central core of SONFR was a group of high-society ladies, including Alexandrina Cantacuzino and, among others, Zoe R\u00e2mniceanu, Elena Odobescu, Anastasia Filipescu, Maria Glagoveanu, Sultana Miclescu and Zetta Manu.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86, 89, 137</ref> As indicated by the name, SONFR was situated on the conservative right of Romanian feminism, where it \"reinforced women's traditional roles as mothers and wives\",<ref name=\"mb (03)64\">Bucur (2003), p.64</ref> being entirely apolitical.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.94; Filitti, p.6</ref> However, the Society was soon involved in a number of adjacent projects, such as disseminating propaganda among the Romanians of [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]], and other parts of [[Austria-Hungary]], and circulating letters of protest against [[Magyarization]].<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.87-88</ref>\n\nAlthough SONFR was sponsored by \"the Nawab\" and other mainline Conservatives, such ideological positions resonated with the National Liberal program of [[Spiru Haret]], the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Minister]], who offered his full support.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.89-90</ref> With such sources of revenue, supplemented by bank loans and private donations, SONFR established two girls' schools, 17 [[kindergarten]]s (the first of which was in [[Doroban\u021bi]]), and 22 public libraries.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.90-94</ref> Some of its funds went directly into purchasing land for Romanian peasant communities in Transylvania and elsewhere, with schools being built as far afield as [[Chernivtsi|Chernowitz]], [[Geaca]], and [[Markovac (Vr\u0161ac)|Markovac]].<ref name=\"gefil6\"/>\n\nSONFR's more formal mission was to combat \"foreign religious propaganda\" and \"the foreign educational establishments\", which it described as sources of corruption for young Romanian women.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86</ref> According to historian Alin Ciupal\u0103, these goals should be seen as reflecting the \"borderline intolerant\" position of Romanian Orthodoxy, but not particularly conclusive at that: \"We believe that SONFR's would-be alliance with the Church determined the adoption by the Ladies' Society leadership of ideas circulated by some Orthodox [[Ordinary (officer)|hierarchs]], especially those concerning Catholicism, but mostly with a tactical goal in mind. [...] Moreover, one might mention here the organizers' intent to make use, as it did, of the Church-controlled, nation-wide, infrastructure: the priests as instruments for propaganda and the influence, not just moral, of the leading Orthodox hierarchs.\"<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.86-87</ref>\n\nSONFR members included liberal [[suffragette]]s, such as [[Calypso Botez]]; Cantacuzino herself was less clearly affiliated with this current, although she did describe herself a \"feminist\".<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/><ref name=\"mb (03)64\"/> As noted by gender historian Roxana Che\u0219chebec, Cantacuzino was primarily an [[Elitism|elitist]], who believed in fulfilling a \"historic mission of the upper classes\", focusing on assisting \"the socially disadvantaged as a way of serving the country and the nation.\"<ref name=\"rche90\">Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90</ref> The same is noted by Pruteanu, who also records her claim that Romanian nobility lived \"outside the murderous luxury that surrounds us.\"<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/> Pruteanu believes that Cantacuzino was \"confused\", with \"a fractured identity\", forever oscillating between \"conformism and rebellion.\"<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in 1913, Grigore was appointed [[Mayor of Bucharest]] in the wake of the \"Tramcar Affair\", which had besmirched the opposition [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]. According to contemporary sources, he owed his appointment exclusively to \"the Nawab\", who was at the time performing his last official function, that of [[President of the Senate of Romania|Senate President]].<ref>Bacalba\u0219a, p.105, 124-125, 152, 154</ref> The immensely large Cantacuzino estate was split between the two sons, both of whom used the [[Cantacuzino Castle|Zamora Castle]] of [[Bu\u0219teni]]. It was to serve as a frequent retreat for the [[Romanian royal family]].<ref name=\"sltcnababul\"/> In 1915, Alexandrina also inherited the properties of her adoptive father, including Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti.<ref name=\"ndi276\"/>\n\n===World War I nurse===\nThe start of [[World War I]] placed Romania in a delicate situation. From 1914 to the summer of 1916, the National Liberal cabinet of [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] preserved the country's neutrality (''see [[Romania during World War I]]''). Public opinion became sharply divided among supporters of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and the \"[[Germanophile]]s\"\u2014who favored the [[Central Powers]], particularly [[German Empire|Germany]]. Grigore Cantacuzino oscillated between the two sides, but his two newspapers, ''Minerva'' and ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', were closely associated with Germanophilia.<ref>Boia, p.94, 191</ref> In September 1914, they were bought from him by a German consortium, and became the mouthpieces of German propaganda.<ref>Boia, p.94</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|1916 Treaty]] with the Entente, [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] and Premier Br\u0103tianu agreed to join the war against the Central Powers. This had the effect of silencing Germanophile dissidence. Alexandrina volunteered for work as a nurse.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.114</ref> In August 1916, she became manager of the No. 113 Hospital, set up at the SONFR Institute in Bucharest with funds from the [[National Bank of Romania]] (her assistant managers were Elena Odobescu and Elena Perticari).<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.94</ref> By the end of the year, however, the Romanian Army was on the retreat everywhere, with the Germans [[Battle of Bucharest|in sight of Bucharest]]. King and government followed the Army retreat into Moldavia, where they remained besieged until 1918. The invasion further divided the Cantacuzino family, between those who aligned themselves with the German regime in Bucharest, and those who, as loyalists, fought against the Germans in Moldavia.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.114-115</ref> The Zamora Castle was requisitioned by the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]], serving as residence for the Governor, [[August von Mackensen]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Robert Boucard, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k602720m/f2.image \"Un r\u00e9ception chez la princesse Cantacuz\u00e8ne, VIII\"], in ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]'', October 27, 1927, p.2 (digitized by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])</ref>\n\nGrigore was an associate of the Germanophile administration set up by [[Lupu Kostaki]] in Bucharest, but moreover a confidant of the skeptical Conservative [[Alexandru Marghiloman]]. Together with Marghiloman and others, he stood up to the Germans when it came to providing for civilian needs, such as when he procured firewood for the Bucharest populace.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.68-69</ref> Reportedly, he also took a mediating position between Marghiloman, who remained respectful of King Ferdinand, and [[Petre P. Carp]], who wanted the dynasty ousted and replaced.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.74-75</ref>\n\nWith Marghiloman as President of the [[Romanian Red Cross]], Alexandrina became a member of the Red Cross \"Ladies' Committee\", working to provide humanitarian assistance for the prisoners-of-war in Romania and abroad.<ref>Dr. Metzulescu, \"Pre\u0219edintele Crucii Ro\u0219ii\", in ''Lui Alexandru Marghiloman, omagiu cu prilejul unei \u00eendoite aniversari: prietenii \u0219i admiratorii lui'', [[Editura Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103]], Bucharest, 1924, p.107-114</ref> Her political attitudes at the time remain a mystery, with the exception of her belief that \"a new world shall rise from the bloodied humanity\"\u2014not as an endorsement of political revolution, but as a trust in the ethnic Romanian capacity for work and rejuvenation.<ref name=\"mprudiscursuri\"/>\n\nOn several occasions, Cantacuzino stood up to the German authorities and protected SONFR's interests, usually with significant success.<ref name=\"gefil7\">Filitti, p.7</ref> SONFR was involved in smuggling recovering Romanian soldiers back into the Moldavian free zone.<ref name=\"mb (03)64\"/> The hospital she managed was eventually evicted by the Germans, and Alexandrina published a letter a protest; she and her husband also spoke up in favor of [[Conon Ar\u0103mescu-Donici|Conon]], the [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Metropolitan Bishop]], who was being pressured into handing in the church administration to Mariu Theodorian-Carada, a Catholic.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26, 34-35</ref> Such shows of dissent almost led to Alexandrina's own imprisonment in a German camp.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26-27; Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.90</ref> \n\n===Marghiloman government===\nAlexandrina returned to work at the hospital. She decided to hold a banquet there in honor of [[Alexandru D. Sturdza]] and other defectors from the loyalist Romanian Army. The affair ended in a brawl between the party guests and the inmates-patients they ran into.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.107-108</ref> In late 1917, with the fall of its [[Russian Republic]]an backers, the Br\u0103tianu administration collapsed in Moldavia, leaving Ferdinand to ponder an [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|armistice with the Germans]]. In Bucharest, the Marghiloman Conservatives created their own Legislative Commission, with the aim of achieving peace and reconciliation; Grigore Cantacuzino was among its members, but failed to win appointment in the subsequent Marghiloman Cabinet.<ref>Theodorian-Carada, p.79-81</ref> \n\nThe year 1918 ended in unexpected defeat for the Germanophiles: the [[First Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|November Armistice]] signaled a sudden victory for the Entente Powers, and instantly brought the fall of Marghiloman's administration. Alexandrina Cantacuzino, who witnessed the events, mediated between the disgraced Marghiloman and General [[Alexandru Averescu]], the King's favorite minister, circulating rumors that Romania was prey to [[revolutionary socialism]].<ref>Marghiloman, p.184-185</ref> Organizing the welcome-back celebrations for [[Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Marie]], she also urged Marghiloman to stay indoors, because the Entente's military mission and the general populace wished to avoid him.<ref>Marghiloman, p.155, 162</ref> As a tribute to her patriotic actions, Cantacuzino was elected SONFR president in 1918; she would lead the Society until 1938.<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.89, 90</ref> \n\nSabina Cantacuzino, Br\u0103tianu's sister and an in-law of Alexandrina's, observed her recovery from the side. In her memoirs, published in 1937, she accuses Alexandrina of staging \"an advertisement\". In her view, the SONFR leader making \"a public show\" of her compassion toward Romanian soldiers, while secure in the knowledge that Grigore Cantacuzino was in favor with the Germans.<ref>Bucur (2010), p.84</ref> Such claims are also found in the diaries of Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu (Br\u0103tianu's daughter and Sabina's niece), who additionally writes that \"Didina\" enjoyed \"hunting with the hounds and running with the hare\".<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.26, 107</ref> These views were met with opprobrium upon publishing: Sabina's work was dismissed as a libelous sample of Br\u0103tianu's \"monopoly on patriotism\".<ref>Bucur (2010), p.84.

As Che\u0219chebec notes, such women intellectuals \"aimed to appease fears of the destructive potential of feminist 'individualism', offering the 'acceptable' and 'nationally authentic' face of Romanian feminism.\" Their publicity efforts were fruitless, since: \"despite ideological differences, all feminists aimed to alter the traditional family order.

In the realm of feminism, Cantacuzino rose to the position of CNFR President.

By then, the apparent successes of [[Italian fascism]], which probably impressed Cantacuzino during her visit to Rome,<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> had widened the fault line in the Romanian feminist movement. Cantacuzino was won over by the fascist critique of [[liberal democracy]], and, while still a feminist, began voicing support for an alternative to Romania's own liberal regime. Cantacuzino envisaged a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] monarchy, campaigned for a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] public administration service, and favored [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] the poorly educated males (while enfranchising educated women).<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2012), p.367-368</ref> \n\nAs argued by Alexandra Petrescu, the GFR's ideology mutated into the \"[[Pan-Latinism|Latin]]\" feminism promoted, on occasion, by [[Benito Mussolini]] himself, with its vision of Latin women as equal combatants in a corporatist revolution.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> This switch in allegiance was occurring just as the Little Entente of Women began fading into insignificance. Cantacuzino was vehemently opposed to the other delegates, including Greece's [[Avra Theodoropoulou]], over the issue of admitting women from [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Single-party period of the Republic of Turkey|Republican Turkey]] and [[Kingdom of Albania (1928\u201339)|Albania]].<ref>Daskalova, p.194</ref>\n\nThe GFR, unlike all other feminist groups, banned women from enlisting in party politics, but encouraged them to run in municipal elections as they pleased.<ref name=\"rche92\"/><ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> According to Petrescu, this demand should be contrasted with the GFR's structure and goals, which, she argues, are those of an informal political party.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Cantacuzino voiced her ideas in the GFR and CNFR petitions of December 1930 and March 1932, while also asking that representatives of women's organizations be assigned seats in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]].<ref name=\"rche(12)367\"/> In 1933, she spoke in front of GFR members about the corporatist \"reconstruction\" of Romania, drafting out her own project for senatorial \"corporatist elections\" by men- and women-electors.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> The immediate effect of such interventions was the creation of a GFR youth wing, ''Tinerele Grupiste'', likely modeled on Italy's ''[[Gruppo Universitario Fascista]]'' (but, unlike it, focused only on campaigns for [[Women in the workforce|female employment]]).<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/>\n\nResearchers are divided when it comes to evaluating the actual appeal of Cantacuzino's nationalist feminism.

Alexandrina was placed her under surveillance, suspected of having helped the outlawed movement,<ref>Che\u0219chebec (2006), p.92; Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.298</ref> while her GFR and ''Tinerele Grupiste'' were also outlawed.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/> Alecu was detained at the concentration camp in [[R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat]], where, unbeknown to his family, he was shot dead by the guards (September 22, 1939).<ref>Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.298, 304</ref> Around October, rumors spread that Alexandrina and her other sons were also about to be interned; the authorities eventually decided to monitor Alexandrina by placing her under house arrest.<ref>Tra\u0219c\u0103 & Born, p.297-298, 304</ref>\n\n===World War II and death===\nThe final stage of Cantacuzino's career covers saw her collateral involvement in the political upheavals of [[World War II]]. During late 1940, Carol fell from power, and the Iron Guard established its \"[[National Legionary State]]\". At its helm was an army man and political maverick, ''[[Conduc\u0103tor]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], on whose behalf Alexandrina Cantacuzino had intervened in the past.<ref name=\"ic116\">Constantin, p.116</ref> As noted by Che\u0219chebec, Alecu's killing \"apparently is not related to Cantacuzino's show of support for the legionary regime\".<ref name=\"rche92\"/> Her decision to join the Iron Guard was motivated, according to Bucur, by \"sheer opportunism or because [she] hoped to carve out a leading, powerful role in such a dynamic movement\", and most likely not by fear of reprisals.<ref>Bucur (2003), p.76-77</ref> Signs of this rapprochement are recorded in the Guard's newspapers: in 1940, ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'' published [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt]]'s interview with Cantacuzino, where she described the political role of women in the National Legionary regime.<ref>Bucur (2003), p.77</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|January 1941 battle]] between the Guard and Antonescu, which was won by the latter, Cantacuzino endured an Antonescu supporter. By June, Antonescu had agreed to participate in [[Operation Barbarossa]]: as an ally of the [[Nazi Germany]], Romania recaptured the lost province of [[Bessarabia]]. In an article for the official propaganda paper, ''[[Universul]]'', Cantacuzino celebrated \"the holy hour\" as the definitive end of \"Jewish democracy\", and envisaged a redemption of Europe under fascist rule.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Lucian Vasile, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/manipularea-presa-prima-luna-al-doilea-razboi-mondial \"Manipularea din pres\u0103 \u00een prima lun\u0103 din al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial\"], in ''Historia'', April 2011</ref> The Antonescu regime soon enforced [[racial antisemitism]] across the land. According to Alexandra Petrescu, the legislation introduced at the time was remarkably similar with the Cantacuzino project of 1937.<ref name=\"apfemaut\"/>\n\nCantacuzino was not an uncritical affiliate of Antonescu's policies, as she showed during her October 1941 visit [[Odessa]], capital of newly occupied [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]]. It took place just days after the Antonescu-ordered [[1941 Odessa massacre|massacre of Odessan Jews]], of which she was informed by the [[Mayor of Odessa|City Mayor]], [[Gherman P\u00e2ntea]]. P\u00e2ntea believed the massacre to have been incidental, not deliberate. Using Cantacuzino as his messenger, asked Antonescu to punish the guilty parties and allow Jewish deportees back in Odessa.<ref>Constantin, p.114-116, 259</ref> P\u00e2ntea reports that Cantacuzino shared his belief that the massacre was going to weigh heavily on \"the entire country\", and that \"an objective inquiry\" was needed; he writes that Antonescu threatened to shoot him for disobedience, but that he changed his mind, and even that he lived to regret his order for massacre.<ref>Constantin, p.116-117</ref> Cantacuzino continued to intervene with Antonescu on other matters, such as when she obtained the naturalization of Pavel Chasovnikov, an Odessan surgeon.<ref>Constantin, p.138</ref>\n\nCantacuzino died in September, October,<ref name=\"rche92\"/> or November 1944.<ref name=\"ndi276\"/> This was closely after [[King Michael's Coup]], which had resulted in Antonescu's arrest and the denunciation of Romania's Nazi alliance. Historian Ion Constantin claims that she committed suicide, \"to avoid the torment of detention under the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]\".<ref name=\"ic116\"/> Roxana Che\u0219chebec, however, records her death cause as \"old age\".<ref name=\"rche92\"/> She was survived by Gheorghe Cantacuzino, who pursued a career in archeology, [[epigraphy]], and [[papyrology]]; he died in 1977.<ref>Constantin Preda, \"Cantacuzino, Gheorghe I.\" [''sic''], in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'', [[Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103]], Bucharest, 1978, p.80-81</ref>\n\nIn the years following Alexandrina's death, Zamora Castle was [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalized]], then assigned to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Ministry]]; reclaimed by the Cantacuzinos after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], and finally reassigned to them in 2004, it was later sold to other private owners.<ref name=\"sltcnababul\"/> The Cioc\u0103ne\u0219ti manor, confiscated from Gheorghe Cantacuzino, was classified as a [[Monument istoric|historical monument]] and [[Writers Union of Romania|Writers' Union]] vacation home, but not before being thoroughly devastated by the local trade unions.<ref>Ion, p.276-281</ref> It was also nationalized in 1949, but continued to be looted after that date.<ref>Ion, p.281-282</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, ''\u00censemn\u0103ri din timpul ocupa\u021biei germane'', Independen\u021ba, Bucharest, 1929\n* [[Constantin Bacalba\u0219a]], ''Bucure\u0219tii de alt\u0103dat\u0103.
