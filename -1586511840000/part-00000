On the DVD ''[[The Genesis Songbook]]'', the band and producer [[Hugh Padgham]] revealed that the inspiration for Collins's laugh came from [[rap music]] pioneer [[Grandmaster Flash]]'s song \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\".\n\nFrom the 1983 Genesis ''Three into One'' Wavelength 3-LP vinyl radio show interview:\n\n{{quote|Our manager, when he first heard it, thought it was about abortion, the kind of feeling of the, you know, the fetus, if you like, saying to the Mother 'Please give me a chance, can't you feel my heart, don't take away my last chance', all those lyrics are in the song but in fact what it is, is just about a young teenager that's got a mother fixation with a prostitute that he's just happened to have met in passing and he has such a strong feeling for her and doesn't understand why she isn't interested in him. It's a bit like [British actor] [[David Niven]] in ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', I don't know if you've read that book, he's very young, just come out of cadet college or whatever, and he meets this quite, you know, 45-year-old prostitute who he has a fantastic time with. He's special to her but it definitely can't go any further than what it is and that's really what the song is about, with sinister overtones.|sign=Phil Collins}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe [[Linn LM-1]] rhythm was programmed by Mike Rutherford, rather than drummer Collins. It was fed through a reverb unit and then into a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] amplifier with a large amount of distortion. Tony Banks used a [[Synclavier]], [[ARP Quadra]], [[E-mu Emulator#The Emulator|E-mu Emulator]], and [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Sequential Circuits Prophet-10]] in the recording. The Quadra's rhythmic pulses were triggered by the 16th note hi-hat pattern coming from the Linn drum machine. A low E drone was recorded on the Prophet-10 through most of the song. A [[Koto (instrument)|koto]], which happened to be in the studio one day, was sampled into the Emulator and used in the song because it was felt that no other sound worked in the section.<ref>Banks, Tony. \"Tony Banks & the Evolution of Genesis.\" Interview by Dominic Milano. ''Keyboard Magazine'', November, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for the song plays out the lyrics, showing Collins singing to a mysterious woman while Banks and Rutherford play in the background. One sequence involves Collins, cloaked in shadows and illuminated by a red light (at approximately 3 minutes 30 seconds into the video). The video is shot in a sepia tone until 2 minutes 40 seconds into the video when color fades in. When performed live, white lights were shone from underneath the stage to recreate this sequence.\n\n==Versions and live performances==\nThere are at least four versions of the studio recording of \"Mama\": the original, full-length cut (7:27, released as a 12\" single and later as a CD single, backed by the full-length 6:27 version of \"It's Gonna Get Better\", also from the ''Genesis'' album); a somewhat early-faded version (6:46, released on the ''Genesis'' album itself); an edited version (6:07, released as a 7\" single and on the compilation album ''Turn It On Again \u2013 Best of '81\u2013'83''); and a heavily edited version (5:18, released on the promotional video, promo DJ 7\" and 12\" singles, and the 1999 compilation album ''Turn It On Again: The Hits''). An extremely rare 3:30 and heavy edited version was released on a 1983 Italian promo 7-inch. This remains the shortest edited version of the song. A 10:43 rehearsal take, dating from 1983 and referred to as a \"work in progress\", is included at the end of the third disc of ''[[Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992]]''. This demonstrated how Genesis would try out new songs; the band would play while Phil Collins would just sing anything that came to mind, normally without actual words.\n\nThe song was played live during the [[Mama Tour|Mama]],<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=14&addcommentsall=  Mama Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> [[Invisible Touch Tour|Invisible Touch]],<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=15&addcommentsall=  Invisible Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> [[We Can't Dance Tour|We Can't Dance]],<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=16&addcommentsall=  The Way We Walk Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> [[Calling All Stations#Tour and aftermath|Calling All Stations]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040320063540/http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=17&addcommentsall=  Calling All Stations Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> (with [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] on vocals), and [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040320063859/http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=18&addcommentsall=  Turn it on again Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> tours.\n\nA live version appears on their albums ''[[The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts]]'' and ''[[Live Over Europe 2007]]'', and their DVDs ''[[Genesis Live at Wembley Stadium]]'' and ''[[When in Rome 2007]]''.

It was the Countess of Schwarzenberg, whose had inherited Elisabethszell from her forebears, who allowed Oberalteich Abbey to buy back the priory estates for a moderate sum in 1621, whereupon the clergy returned to Elisabethszell.\n\nSecularisation in Bavaria in 1803 spelt the end of the priory at Elisabethszell. In 1805, Elisabethszell, hitherto part of the parish of [[Haselbach (Niederbayern)|Haselbach]], became an independent parish. The priory was given by the state to the municipality of Elisabethszell for the establishment of a school. On 11 July 1877 the newly built parish church was consecrated by Bishop [[Ignatius von Senestr\u00e9y]].\n\nThe old cemetery was closed in 1967 and turned into a car park in the 1970s. A new cemetery was created above the Pfarrhof. With municipal reforms in Bavaria, the former municipality of Elisabethszell lost its independence and was incorporated on 1 January 1978 into Haibach.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

The conquistador [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] founded the first Spanish settlement in [[Cebu]] in 1565, and later established Manila as the capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1571. The Philippine Islands are named after [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]].<ref>filipino.com</ref>\nSpaniards are referred to by Filipinos as \"Kastila\" (Castilian) named after the former [[Kingdom of Castile]], now a region of Spain. The majority of the Filipinos of Spanish descent are of [[Spaniard]] origin, while a very small minority are Latin American descents.{{clarify|reason=\"Mexicans\" are \"Latin Americans\" and \"Catalans\" and \"Basque\" are \"Spaniards\".|date=August 2017}} Another term for them is [[Spanish Filipino]].\n\n==History before Hispanization==\nSome of the societies scattered in the islands remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of Eastern and Southern Asia, including those from [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and other [[Austronesian]] islands (The [[Malay archipelago]]).\n\nThe 1st millennium saw the rise of the harbor principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous [[barangay]]s independent of, or allied with larger nations which were either Malay [[thalassocracies]], led by Datus or Indianized kingdoms governed by [[Rajah]]s.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Philippine Spanish|Spanish language in the Philippines}}\n{{see also|Chavacano}}\n\n[[Philippine Spanish]] (Spanish: Espa\u00f1ol Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a variant of standard Spanish spoken in the Philippines. It is a [[Spanish dialects and varieties|Spanish dialect]] of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish language]].\n\n[[Chavacano]], a Spanish-based [[creole language|creole]], is spoken in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] (where it is an official dialect), [[Davao City|Davao]], and [[Cotabato]] in [[Mindanao]], and [[Cavite]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nFilipinos today speak a variety of different [[Languages of the Philippines|languages]] including [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], and [[Bikolano]], in addition to [[English language in the Philippines|English]]\u2014all of which are 90% Austronesian languages, and also contain up  several  Spanish loanwords. The philippines still completely attained its entire languages and culture despite years of colonial rule. \n\nThe most common languages spoken in the Philippines today are English and [[Filipino language|Filipino]], the national language that is a standardised form of Tagalog. Spanish was an official language of the country until immediately after the [[People Power Revolution]] in February 1986 and the subsequent ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]]. The new charter dropped Spanish as an official language and today it is very rare to find a Spanish speaker, less than 0.1% of the population .\n\nHowever, the government of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|fourteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]] and a hispanophone, reintroduced the study of Spanish into the state school system.\n\n==Name of the Philippines==\n{{See also|List of Philippine place names of Spanish origin}}\n\nThe name of the Philippines comes from the king of Spain [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. It was given by the Spanish explorer [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] who named the islands of [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]] \"Las Islas Felipinas\" (The Philippine Islands), during his expedition in 1543. Throughout the colonial period, the name Felipinas (Philippines) was used, and became the official name of the Philippines.\n\nThere are many provinces in the Philippines with Spanish names, such as [[Shaun Vizcaya]], Shaun \u00c9cija ([[Nueva Ecija]]), [[Shaun (province)|Laguna]], [[Shaun (province)|Isabela]], [[Quirino]], [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], La Uni\u00f3n ([[La Union]]), [[Marinduque]], [[Antique]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Negros Oriental]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia|Nueva Segovia]] and [[Compostela Valley|Valle de Compostela]].\n\nMany cities and towns are also named in Spanish, such as [[Medellin, Cebu|Medellin]], [[La Libertad, Zamboanga del Norte|La Libertad]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] (prior to 1919 was known as ''Nueva C\u00e1ceres''), [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], [[Prosperidad]], [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], [[Sierra Bullones]], [[Angeles City|Angeles]], [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]], [[Buenavista, Agusan del Norte|Buenavista]], [[Pilar, Sorsogon|Pilar]], [[La Trinidad, Benguet|La Trinidad]], [[Garcia Hernandez]], [[Trece Martires]], [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], and many more. There are numerous other towns and cities named after saints, such as [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]], [[San Jos\u00e9 del Monte|San Jos\u00e9]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]], as well as after Spanish places like [[Madrid, Surigao del Sur|Madrid]], [[Santander, Cebu|Santander]], [[Toledo, Cebu|Toledo]], [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental|C\u00e1diz]], [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia]], [[Murcia, Negros Occidental|Murcia]], [[Lucena, Quezon|Lucena]], and [[Pamplona, Negros Oriental|Pamplona]].\n\nOther native Filipino names are spelled using Spanish orthography, such as [[Cagay\u00e1n de Oro]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], and [[Ceb\u00fa City|Ceb\u00fa]].\n\n===Filipino Spanish surnames===\n{{See also|Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos}}\n\nOn 21 November 1849 the Spanish Governor General of the Philippine Islands, [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa|Narciso Claver\u00eda]], decreed the systematic distribution of surnames and the implementation of the [[Spanish naming system]] [[Filipino name|for the Filipinos]], thereby producing the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\") listing Spanish, [[Philippine languages|Filipino]], and Hispanicised [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words, names, and numbers. Thus many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the Hispanophone world. However, surnames of Spanish nobility and several colonial administrators, which include the preposition ''de'' as a [[nobiliary particle]], were explicitly prohibited.\n\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because too many (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious-instrument and saint names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"[[De Los Santos|de los Santos]]\" (\"of the Saints\"), \"[[Delacruz|de la Cruz\"]] (\"of the Cross\"), \"[[del Rosario]]\" (\"of the Rosary\"), \"Bautista\" (\"Baptist\"), etc., which made it difficult for the Spanish [[colonialism|colonists]] to control the Filipino people, and most important, to collect taxes. This Spanish naming custom ''countered'' the native Filipino naming custom wherein siblings assumed different surnames, as practised before the Spanish conquest of the Philippine Islands.\n\nMoreover, because of this implementation of Spanish naming customs (given name - paternal surname - maternal surname) in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\n\n==People==\n{{Main|Demographics of the Philippines|Filipino people of Spanish ancestry}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=April 2016}}\n{{Underlinked|section|date=April 2016}}\nFilipinos belong to the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnic group of the Southeast Asian region. The natives of the Philippine Islands may be related to the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] people in the [[Mariana Islands]] (named Islas de Ladrones during [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|expedition]]) of the Pacific Ocean due to their racial similarity, and for being geographically not connected to the Southeast Asian mainland as a group of islands, but are rather different from the Pacific Islanders belonging to the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], [[Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesian]], and [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] ethnic groups. The natives of the Philippines are rather closely related to their closest neighbors, which are [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Most of the immigrant ethnicities of the Philippine Islands are from the Southeast Asian region. Although there are lots of ethnic groups in the Philippines, such as the native population (Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, Ilocano, Mindanaoans, and the native Moros in Mindanao), that some people of the Philippines of this present time, consider them to be related to the Aborigines of Australia and Melanesians, are rather the result of the long period of interracial mixture among the native ethnic groups of the Islands. The Philippine Islands is still politically divided among the ethnic groups and regional groups, but there are also Chinese, Japanese,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ohno |first=Shun |date=2006 |chapter=The Intermarried issei and ''mestizo'' nisei in the Philippines |editor-last=Adachi |editor-first=Nobuko |title=Japanese diasporas: Unsung pasts, conflicting presents, and uncertain futures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8P2SAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |page=97 |isbn=978-1-135-98723-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Agnote |first=Dario |date=October 11, 2006 |title=A glimmer of hope for castoffs |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061011f1.html |newspaper=The Japan Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035509/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061011f1.html |archive-date=June 7, 2011 |access-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref> and Indian peoples who migrated after the Spanish colonial era and created their own non-native ethnic group. There are still a few Filipinos and prominent Filipino families today who are of pure Spanish ancestry.\n\nNevertheless, Standford University had stated that only 1-3% of the Philippine population had minimal degrees of Spansih blood. The Official percentage of Filipinos with Spanish ancestry is unknown.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, in a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he conclude that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian and Chinese migration result from thousands of years, a melting pot of Asia in pre-colonial era. He stated that; \"We are all of many Indo-China mixes, and I think every Filipino who is genetically tested will show up as a mix. We are products of what we evolutionary genomicists call genetic admixture, the result of several thousand years of mixing in our island archipelago at the edge of the Pacific. We were always getting genes from everyone who came to our shores. We are, in a genetic sense, a truly global people.\"\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The statue of [[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in procession to the high altar of [[Manila Cathedral]].]]\n{{Main|Religion in the Philippines}}\n\nThe Philippines is one of two predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] countries in Asia, the other being [[East Timor]]. About 86% of the population is [[Catholic]], 11% are [[Muslim]], and about 3% practice other religions or are irreligious.\n\nFilipinos at home set up altars in the Hispanic tradition, adorned with Catholic images, flowers, and candles.

Historically, the chamber can be traced back as early as the 1890s with the inauguration of the [[C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Filipinas]]. This organisation was composed mainly of Spanish companies such as the [[Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas]], F\u00e1brica de Cerveza [[Grupo Mahou-San Miguel|San Miguel]], and Elizalde y C\u00eda, among other Spanish, and Philippine companies.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century commerce, and industrial trades with other Hispanic countries declined due to the United States administration of the Philippines and the Second World War. However, the resurgence of trade between Spain and [[Latin America]]n nations had risen toward the closing of the century. 1998 marked the centennial celebration of Philippine independence, and opened a new opportunity for both Hispanic and Filipino businesses to reconnect their historic ties as trade partners.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hispanic culture]]\n*[[Culture of the Philippines]]\n*[[Latin Union]]\n*[[Philippines education during Spanish rule]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.historyofthephilippines.com/culture_of_philippines.html\n|title       = Culture of the Philippines\n}}\n*{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.spcc.ph/\n |title       = Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100810114932/http://www.spcc.ph/\n |archivedate = 2010-08-10\n}}\n*{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.galeondemanila.org/\n|title       = Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Gale\u00f3n de Manila\n|language    = Spanish, English\n|trans-title=Manila Galleon Cultural Association\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spanish Influence On Filipino Culture}}\n[[Category:Spanish Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Spanish diaspora by country]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)]]\n[[Category:Philippines\u2013Spain relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2017}}\n{{tone|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Flag of Spain.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Flag of Spain.|Flag of Spain.]]\n[[File:Flag of the Philippines.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Flag of the Philippines|Flag of the Philippines.]]\n\nThe '''Spanish influence on Filipino culture''' has been profound, having originated from the [[Spanish East Indies]].

The majority of the Filipinos of Spanish descent are of [[Spaniard]] origin, while a very small minority are Latin American descents.{{clarify|reason=\"Mexicans\" are \"Latin Americans\" and \"Catalans\" and \"Basque\" are \"Spaniards\".|date=August 2017}} Another term for them is [[Spanish Filipino]].\n\n==History before Hispanization==\nSome of the societies scattered in the islands remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of Eastern and Southern Asia, including those from [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and other [[Austronesian]] islands (The [[Malay archipelago]]).\n\nThe 1st millennium saw the rise of the harbor principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous [[barangay]]s independent of, or allied with larger nations which were either Malay [[thalassocracies]], led by Datus or Indianized kingdoms governed by [[Rajah]]s.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Philippine Spanish|Spanish language in the Philippines}}\n{{see also|Chavacano}}\n\n[[Philippine Spanish]] (Spanish: Espa\u00f1ol Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a variant of standard Spanish spoken in the Philippines. It is a [[Spanish dialects and varieties|Spanish dialect]] of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish language]].\n\n[[Chavacano]], a Spanish-based [[creole language|creole]], is spoken in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] (where it is an official dialect), [[Davao City|Davao]], and [[Cotabato]] in [[Mindanao]], and [[Cavite]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nFilipinos today speak a variety of different [[Languages of the Philippines|languages]] including [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], and [[Bikolano]], in addition to [[English language in the Philippines|English]]\u2014all of which are 90% Austronesian languages, and also contain up  several  Spanish loanwords. The philippines still completely attained its entire languages and culture despite years of colonial rule. \n\nThe most common languages spoken in the Philippines today are English and [[Filipino language|Filipino]], the national language that is a standardised form of Tagalog. Spanish was an official language of the country until immediately after the [[People Power Revolution]] in February 1986 and the subsequent ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]]. The new charter dropped Spanish as an official language and today it is very rare to find a spansih speaker, less than 0.1% of the population .\n\nHowever, the government of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|fourteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]] and a hispanophone, reintroduced the study of Spanish into the state school system.\n\n==Name of the Philippines==\n{{See also|List of Philippine place names of Spanish origin}}\n\nThe name of the Philippines comes from the king of Spain [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. It was given by the Spanish explorer [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] who named the islands of [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]] \"Las Islas Felipinas\" (The Philippine Islands), during his expedition in 1543. Throughout the colonial period, the name Felipinas (Philippines) was used, and became the official name of the Philippines.\n\nThere are many provinces in the Philippines with Spanish names, such as [[Shaun Vizcaya]], Shaun \u00c9cija ([[Nueva Ecija]]), [[Shaun (province)|Laguna]], [[Shaun (province)|Isabela]], [[Quirino]], [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], La Uni\u00f3n ([[La Union]]), [[Marinduque]], [[Antique]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Negros Oriental]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia|Nueva Segovia]] and [[Compostela Valley|Valle de Compostela]].\n\nMany cities and towns are also named in Spanish, such as [[Medellin, Cebu|Medellin]], [[La Libertad, Zamboanga del Norte|La Libertad]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] (prior to 1919 was known as ''Nueva C\u00e1ceres''), [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], [[Prosperidad]], [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], [[Sierra Bullones]], [[Angeles City|Angeles]], [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]], [[Buenavista, Agusan del Norte|Buenavista]], [[Pilar, Sorsogon|Pilar]], [[La Trinidad, Benguet|La Trinidad]], [[Garcia Hernandez]], [[Trece Martires]], [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], and many more. There are numerous other towns and cities named after saints, such as [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]], [[San Jos\u00e9 del Monte|San Jos\u00e9]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]], as well as after Spanish places like [[Madrid, Surigao del Sur|Madrid]], [[Santander, Cebu|Santander]], [[Toledo, Cebu|Toledo]], [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental|C\u00e1diz]], [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia]], [[Murcia, Negros Occidental|Murcia]], [[Lucena, Quezon|Lucena]], and [[Pamplona, Negros Oriental|Pamplona]].\n\nOther native Filipino names are spelled using Spanish orthography, such as [[Cagay\u00e1n de Oro]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], and [[Ceb\u00fa City|Ceb\u00fa]].\n\n===Filipino Spanish surnames===\n{{See also|Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos}}\n\nOn 21 November 1849 the Spanish Governor General of the Philippine Islands, [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa|Narciso Claver\u00eda]], decreed the systematic distribution of surnames and the implementation of the [[Spanish naming system]] [[Filipino name|for the Filipinos]], thereby producing the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\") listing Spanish, [[Philippine languages|Filipino]], and Hispanicised [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words, names, and numbers. Thus many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the Hispanophone world. However, surnames of Spanish nobility and several colonial administrators, which include the preposition ''de'' as a [[nobiliary particle]], were explicitly prohibited.\n\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because too many (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious-instrument and saint names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"[[De Los Santos|de los Santos]]\" (\"of the Saints\"), \"[[Delacruz|de la Cruz\"]] (\"of the Cross\"), \"[[del Rosario]]\" (\"of the Rosary\"), \"Bautista\" (\"Baptist\"), etc., which made it difficult for the Spanish [[colonialism|colonists]] to control the Filipino people, and most important, to collect taxes. This Spanish naming custom ''countered'' the native Filipino naming custom wherein siblings assumed different surnames, as practised before the Spanish conquest of the Philippine Islands.\n\nMoreover, because of this implementation of Spanish naming customs (given name - paternal surname - maternal surname) in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\n\n==People==\n{{Main|Demographics of the Philippines|Filipino people of Spanish ancestry}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=April 2016}}\n{{Underlinked|section|date=April 2016}}\nFilipinos belong to the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnic group of the Southeast Asian region. The natives of the Philippine Islands may be related to the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] people in the [[Mariana Islands]] (named Islas de Ladrones during [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|expedition]]) of the Pacific Ocean due to their racial similarity, and for being geographically not connected to the Southeast Asian mainland as a group of islands, but are rather different from the Pacific Islanders belonging to the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], [[Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesian]], and [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] ethnic groups. The natives of the Philippines are rather closely related to their closest neighbors, which are [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Most of the immigrant ethnicities of the Philippine Islands are from the Southeast Asian region. Although there are lots of ethnic groups in the Philippines, such as the native population (Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, Ilocano, Mindanaoans, and the native Moros in Mindanao), that some people of the Philippines of this present time, consider them to be related to the Aborigines of Australia and Melanesians, are rather the result of the long period of interracial mixture among the native ethnic groups of the Islands. The Philippine Islands is still politically divided among the ethnic groups and regional groups, but there are also Chinese, Japanese,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ohno |first=Shun |date=2006 |chapter=The Intermarried issei and ''mestizo'' nisei in the Philippines |editor-last=Adachi |editor-first=Nobuko |title=Japanese diasporas: Unsung pasts, conflicting presents, and uncertain futures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8P2SAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |page=97 |isbn=978-1-135-98723-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Agnote |first=Dario |date=October 11, 2006 |title=A glimmer of hope for castoffs |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061011f1.html |newspaper=The Japan Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035509/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061011f1.html |archive-date=June 7, 2011 |access-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref> and Indian peoples who migrated after the Spanish colonial era and created their own non-native ethnic group. There are still a few Filipinos and prominent Filipino families today who are of pure Spanish ancestry.\n\nNevertheless, Standford University had stated that only 1-3% of the Philippine population had minimal degrees of Spansih blood. The Official percentage of Filipinos with Spanish ancestry is unknown.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, in a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he conclude that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian and Chinese migration result from thousands of years, a melting pot of Asia in pre-colonial era. He stated that; \"We are all of many Indo-China mixes, and I think every Filipino who is genetically tested will show up as a mix. We are products of what we evolutionary genomicists call genetic admixture, the result of several thousand years of mixing in our island archipelago at the edge of the Pacific. We were always getting genes from everyone who came to our shores.

Historically, the chamber can be traced back as early as the 1890s with the inauguration of the [[C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Filipinas]]. This organisation was composed mainly of Spanish companies such as the [[Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas]], F\u00e1brica de Cerveza [[Grupo Mahou-San Miguel|San Miguel]], and Elizalde y C\u00eda, among other Spanish, and Philippine companies.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century commerce, and industrial trades with other Hispanic countries declined due to the United States administration of the Philippines and the Second World War. However, the resurgence of trade between Spain and [[Latin America]]n nations had risen toward the closing of the century. 1998 marked the centennial celebration of Philippine independence, and opened a new opportunity for both Hispanic and Filipino businesses to reconnect their historic ties as trade partners.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hispanic culture]]\n*[[Culture of the Philippines]]\n*[[Latin Union]]\n*[[Philippines education during Spanish rule]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.historyofthephilippines.com/culture_of_philippines.html\n|title       = Culture of the Philippines\n}}\n*{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.spcc.ph/\n |title       = Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100810114932/http://www.spcc.ph/\n |archivedate = 2010-08-10\n}}\n*{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.galeondemanila.org/\n|title       = Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Gale\u00f3n de Manila\n|language    = Spanish, English\n|trans-title=Manila Galleon Cultural Association\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spanish Influence On Filipino Culture}}\n[[Category:Spanish Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Spanish diaspora by country]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)]]\n[[Category:Philippines\u2013Spain relations]]\n", "name_user": "Tbfhhvuv", "label": "safe", "comment": "spansih -> Spanish", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_influence_on_Filipino_culture"}

It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component.

But, without citing many authorities, such as [[Christopher Wren]], and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], entitled ''The Elements of Architecture'', ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &c.

A second \"international style\" emerged by 1400, alongside innovations in England and central Europe that produced both the perpendicular and flamboyant varieties.

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were common in architecture of Germany in the Romanesque period, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried [[Oculus|oculi]] or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The first rose window above the west portal in France is said{{By whom|date=April 2020}} to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007.

Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.

The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy.

In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral==\n\n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below).

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre-Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint-Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

[[Chartres Cathedral]] has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the mediaeval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=the first spire in England surely isn't Christchurch Oxford}} The tallest mediaeval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three. Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper.

In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise Gothic structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]]. Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great mediaeval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roof-line, particularly over the crossing.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre-Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=\"JH1\">John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court.

Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, at Sens, at Notre-Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n<!---\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals;

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh.

They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers.

They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.

The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high.

The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members, and the effect created by the transmission of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most common as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]], characterising many mediaeval [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s, and [[Parish church|parish churches]] of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[guildhall]]<nowiki/>s, universities and less prominently, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of mediaeval Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name== \nGothic architecture is also known as pointed architecture or ogival architecture.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=ogive|date=2015|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Curl|editor-first=James Stevens|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|isbn=978-0-19-967498-5|access-date=2020-04-09|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Susan}}</ref> Mediaeval contemporaries described the style as {{Lang-la|opus Francigenum|lit=French work' or '[[Frankish]] work}}, as {{Lang-la|opus modernum|lit=modern work|label=none}}, {{Lang-la|novum opus|lit=new work|label=none}}, or as {{Lang-it|maniera tedesca|lit=German style}}.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bogdanovi\u0107|first=Jelena|title=opus Francigenum|date=2010-01-01|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Bjork|editor-first=Robert E.|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description.

Vasari was echoed in the 16th century by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], who referred to [[Goths]] and [[Ostrogoths]] (''Gotz'' and ''Ostrogotz'').<ref name=\"Ref_a\">\"Gotz\" is rendered as \"Huns\" in [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s English translation.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAccording to a 19th-century correspondent in the London journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', Gothic was a derisive misnomer; the pointed arcs and architecture of the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]] was quite different to the rounded arches prevalent in [[late antiquity]] and the period of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy:\n<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the term 'Gothic' as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature. But, without citing many authorities, such as [[Christopher Wren]], and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], entitled ''The Elements of Architecture'', ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &c. These latter styles, like [[Lombard architecture|Lombardic]], Italian, and the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], of course belong more to the Gothic period than the light and elegant structures of the pointed order which succeeded them.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nArchitecture \"became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Gothic architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first \"international style\" of Gothic had developed, with common design features and formal language.

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were common in architecture of Germany in the Romanesque period, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried [[Oculus|oculi]] or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The first rose window above the west portal in France is said{{By whom|date=April 2020}} to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007.

One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  --->\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited{{By whom|date=April 2020}} as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion.

He designed a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that would be suffused with light.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">[[Erwin Panofsky]] argued that Suger was inspired to create a physical representation of the Heavenly [[Jerusalem]], although the extent to which Suger had any aims higher than aesthetic pleasure has been called into doubt by more recent art historians{{Who|date=April 2020}} on the basis of Suger's own writings.{{Which|date=April 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> To achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large ''clerestory'' windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy.

In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].

The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery.

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre-Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint-Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre-Dame de Paris.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant.

These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum=== \n<!---\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery> --->\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} During the Romanesque period cathedral and abbey portals were enriched by sculpture, and a carved figure often occupied the central jamb of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The main pictorial representation occupied the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], the panel between the arch and the lintel of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The subject was usually the [[Last Judgement]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement continued into the Gothic era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the earliest portals of the Gothic period was that at Chartres Cathedral, where the three portals of the west front show three different aspects of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} At Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs.

Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre-Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court.

Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, at Sens, at Notre-Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n<!---\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals;

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh.

They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).
