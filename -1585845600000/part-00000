He has released more than two-dozen albums as leader, twenty as collaborator and appears as a sideman on sixty more. \u00a0Among his many accomplishments are a 2003 Guggenheim Fellowship in Composition, five Grammy nominations for Best Instrumental Performance and a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Composition. \u00a0As a composer of concert music, he has been commissioned by The Gilmore Keyboard Festival, Roomful of Teeth, the Opus 21 Ensemble, The Miller Theater at Columbia University, The Brooklyn Youth Chorus, The Gramercy Trio, Peak Performances@Montclair State and many others; his concert music is published by Edition Peters. \n\n==Early life==\nHersch was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, of Jewish parents. He began playing the piano at the age of four (under the tutelage of [[Jeanne Kirstein]]) and started composing music by eight. He won national piano competitions starting at the age of ten.\n\nHersch first became interested in jazz while at [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa. He dropped out of school and started playing jazz in Cincinnati. He continued his studies at the New England Conservatory, attracting attention from the press \u2013 \"a fine showcase for Fred Hersch\" \u2013 in a college recital.<ref>\"the third stream\" (Jan 20, 1977) '' Bay State Banner'', Boston</ref> On graduation, he became a jazz piano instructor at the college.<ref>\"Jazzman on Classic Path To Wider Audience: Pianist Fred Hersch\" (July 9, 1989) ''San Francisco Chronicle'' p. 42</ref>\n\n==Career==\nOne of Fred Hersch's earliest professional engagements was with [[Art Farmer]] in Los Angeles in 1978.

He is openly involved in what he is playing and projects this involvement with body English and facial expressions that subtly underline the sense of his music. His lines often become gently billowing waves of sound, and he rises and falls, tenses and relaxes along with them.\"<ref>\"Jazz Fred Hersch, Pianist\" (Mar 26, 1983) ''The New York Times'' p. 1.19</ref>\n\nIn 1983\u201384, Hersch played many sessions with [[Jane Ira Bloom]] in several venues, and with whom he recorded the album, ''Mighty Lights''.<ref>\"The Pop Life\" (Apr 13, 1983) ''The New York Times</ref><ref>\"Jane Ira Bloom Plays in Fast Company\" (Apr 15, 1983) '' Philadelphia Daily News''</ref><ref>\"Here and There\" (Jan 20, 1984) ''Philadelphia Daily News'' p.43</ref>\n\nIn 1985, he played with the Jamie Baum Quartet.<ref>\"Regattabar to Launch 7-Nights-a-Week Jazz\" (Mar 1, 1985) ''Boston Globe''</ref>\n\nIn 1986, he played with [[Toots Thielemans]] at the Great Woods jazz festival.<ref>\"Thielemans Whistles for Fun, Profit\" (11 July 1986) ''Boston Globe''</ref> He played with him in several sessions the following year,<ref>\"AROUND TOWN Bridging the Seasons\" (9 Sep 1987) ''Newsday'' p.14</ref><ref>Leonard Feather (21 Sep 1987) \"JAZZ REVIEWS THIELEMANS ON TOP\", ''Los Angeles Times'' p.5</ref> and again in 1987, receiving special attention for his solos.<ref>\"Toots Thielemans Plays a Hot Jazz Harmonica\" (5 Feb 1987) ''Boston Globe''</ref>  In 1986, he taught at [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref>\"Schools Offer the Mechanical While Fostering the Spiritual\" (13 July 1986) ''Chicago Tribune'' p.8</ref>\n\nHe was the pianist for the [[Eddie Daniels]] quartet in 1987 and appeared on his album, ''To Bird with Love''.<ref>\"Critic's Choice: Jazz\" (May 17, 1987) ''The New York Times''</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Hersch played in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] with his quintet at the [[Ball Square|Willow Jazz Club]].

He has performed solo and led his own groups, including the Pocket Orchestra consisting of piano, trumpet, voice, and percussion. He was the first person to play weeklong engagements as a solo pianist at the [[Village Vanguard]] in New York City. He has recorded more than 70 of his jazz compositions. Hersch has been nominated for several Grammy Awards, and, as of December 2014, had been on the Jazz Studies faculty of the [[New England Conservatory]] since 1980 (with breaks).<ref>[http://necmusic.edu/faculty/fred-hersch \"Faculty Profile: Fred Hersch\"] (15 July 2017) Retrieved on 1 November 2017.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHersch was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, of Jewish parents. He began playing the piano at the age of four (under the tutelage of [[Jeanne Kirstein]]) and started composing music by eight. He won national piano competitions starting at the age of ten.\n\nHersch first became interested in jazz while at [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa. He dropped out of school and started playing jazz in Cincinnati. He continued his studies at the New England Conservatory, attracting attention from the press \u2013 \"a fine showcase for Fred Hersch\" \u2013 in a college recital.<ref>\"the third stream\" (Jan 20, 1977) '' Bay State Banner'', Boston</ref> On graduation, he became a jazz piano instructor at the college.<ref>\"Jazzman on Classic Path To Wider Audience: Pianist Fred Hersch\" (July 9, 1989) ''San Francisco Chronicle'' p. 42</ref>\n\n==Career==\nOne of Fred Hersch's earliest professional engagements was with [[Art Farmer]] in Los Angeles in 1978. Jazz critic [[Leonard Feather]] wrote that he \"showed his ability as an accompanist and soloist at the out-of-tune piano\".<ref>\"Art Farmer Plays at Memory Lane\" (Nov 9, 1978) ''Los Angeles Times'' p.

A70</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Hersch played a duo session with bassist Ratzo Harris at the Knickerbocker Saloon, New York. ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"Mr. Hersch is a romantic. He is openly involved in what he is playing and projects this involvement with body English and facial expressions that subtly underline the sense of his music. His lines often become gently billowing waves of sound, and he rises and falls, tenses and relaxes along with them.\"<ref>\"Jazz Fred Hersch, Pianist\" (Mar 26, 1983) ''The New York Times'' p. 1.19</ref>\n\nIn 1983\u201384, Hersch played many sessions with [[Jane Ira Bloom]] in several venues, and with whom he recorded the album, ''Mighty Lights''.<ref>\"The Pop Life\" (Apr 13, 1983) ''The New York Times</ref><ref>\"Jane Ira Bloom Plays in Fast Company\" (Apr 15, 1983) '' Philadelphia Daily News''</ref><ref>\"Here and There\" (Jan 20, 1984) ''Philadelphia Daily News'' p.43</ref>\n\nIn 1985, he played with the Jamie Baum Quartet.<ref>\"Regattabar to Launch 7-Nights-a-Week Jazz\" (Mar 1, 1985) ''Boston Globe''</ref>\n\nIn 1986, he played with [[Toots Thielemans]] at the Great Woods jazz festival.<ref>\"Thielemans Whistles for Fun, Profit\" (11 July 1986) ''Boston Globe''</ref> He played with him in several sessions the following year,<ref>\"AROUND TOWN Bridging the Seasons\" (9 Sep 1987) ''Newsday'' p.14</ref><ref>Leonard Feather (21 Sep 1987) \"JAZZ REVIEWS THIELEMANS ON TOP\", ''Los Angeles Times'' p.5</ref> and again in 1987, receiving special attention for his solos.<ref>\"Toots Thielemans Plays a Hot Jazz Harmonica\" (5 Feb 1987) ''Boston Globe''</ref>  In 1986, he taught at [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref>\"Schools Offer the Mechanical While Fostering the Spiritual\" (13 July 1986) ''Chicago Tribune'' p.8</ref>\n\nHe was the pianist for the [[Eddie Daniels]] quartet in 1987 and appeared on his album, ''To Bird with Love''.<ref>\"Critic's Choice: Jazz\" (May 17, 1987) ''The New York Times''</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Hersch played in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] with his quintet at the [[Ball Square|Willow Jazz Club]].

The Norwegian vocalist [[Roy Khan]] joined for the album ''[[Si\u00e9ge Perilous]]'', and shared songwriting credit with Youngblood until his departure in April 2011. On June 22, 2012, Youngblood announced on their website that their new vocalist would be the Swedish singer [[Tommy Karevik]], who was first featured on Kamelot's album ''[[Silverthorn (album)|Silverthorn]]'' as the main vocalist, co-songwriter, and lyricist. As of 2020, Kamelot had released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one live DVD and twenty music videos.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years, ''Eternity'', ''Dominion'' and ''Si\u00e9ge Perilous'' (1987\u20131998)===\n\nThe band was formed back in 1987, in Florida, by guitarist [[Thomas Youngblood]], with Richard Warner on drums, Rob Beck on vocals and Dirk Van Tilborg on bass and keyboards, as \"Camelot\".

After this, David Pavlicko was recruited as keyboardist and, on the next year, the band signed a deal with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and released its first album, ''[[Eternity (Kamelot album)|Eternity]]'', in 1995. The next album, ''[[Dominion (Kamelot album)|Dominion]]'', was released in 1997. Later that year, founder Richard Warner departed the band and drummer Casey Grillo was brought in.

A few months later, the band released its fifth album, ''[[Karma (Kamelot album)|Karma]]''. The sixth album, ''[[Epica (Kamelot album)|Epica]]'', was released in 2003.

On the second leg of the Black Halo World Tour, Kamelot visited North America (Canada and the United States), South America (Brazil), and Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden).
