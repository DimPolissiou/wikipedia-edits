It spans from [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] (Jericho Turnpike) in [[Commack, New York|Commack]] to [[New York State Route 27|NY&nbsp;27]] (Sunrise Highway) in [[Holbrook, New York|Holbrook]]. The route provides access to the [[Long Island MacArthur Airport]], as well as New York State and Suffolk County government offices, and at one time the [[Long Island Arena]]. NY&nbsp;454 serves as the northern terminus for the [[Northern State Parkway]] in [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge]], where a concurrency with [[New York State Route 347|NY&nbsp;347]] begins.\n\nThe origins of NY&nbsp;454 dates back to the late 1940s when a new freeway was constructed from [[Commack[[ to [[Holbrook]] for $1.4&nbsp;million (1949 USD). This new freeway was designated as a memorial for Suffolk County War Veterans. The route was designed and constructed by the [[Suffolk County Department of Public Works]] under watch and aid from the [[New York State Department of Public Works]] and the United States government. Upon completion in January 1950, the route was designated as [[County Route 76 (Suffolk County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;76]] (CR&nbsp;76) west of Town Line Road and [[County Route 78 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;78]] southeast of Town Line Road until 1968 when the entire highway was designated CR&nbsp;78. In 1972, the state took over control of the new highway and designated it NY&nbsp;454. Recently, there have been plans to expand the highway and the [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with Route&nbsp;347 with new travel lanes and a new interchange being built between the two highways.\n\n== Route description ==\n[[File:New York State Route 454 approaching the SM Parkway South.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;454 approaching the Sunken Meadow State Parkway in Commack]]\nNY&nbsp;454 begins at a fork along [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] ([[Jericho Turnpike]]) in [[Commack, New York|Commack]]. The route heads southeastward as the four-lane Veterans Memorial Highway, passing through a large commercial district built up around NY&nbsp;454's interchange with the [[Sunken Meadow State Parkway]] (exit&nbsp;SM2). From there, NY&nbsp;454 continues eastward through a residential district for several miles and passes to the south of Whitman Hollow Park. The arterial continues southeastward through local residential areas with four lanes before meeting [[New York State Route 347|NY&nbsp;347]] and the [[Northern State Parkway]] at an interchange in [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge]]. The junction serves as the western terminus of NY&nbsp;347 and the eastern terminus of the Northern Parkway. NY&nbsp;347 and NY&nbsp;454 [[concurrency (road)|become concurrent]], crossing through Hauppauge and residential properties for the next two miles (3.2&nbsp;km), intersecting with local roads. After bending around Forestwood Park, Routes&nbsp;454 and 347 follow the town line and pass the Stoubrough Golf Course, where NY&nbsp;347 forks to the northeast.<ref name=\"bing\">{{bing maps |title=overview map of NY 454 |accessdate=December 26, 2009 |url=http://www.maps.bing.com/maps/?FORM=Z9LH7#JmNwPTQwLjgwNjA0MjY2Mzc1MzA0fi03My4xNzQ2MTE4MTQzMjAwOSZsdmw9MTImc3R5PXImcnRwPXBvcy40MC44NDIzNTI3MzMwMTYwMTRfLTczLjI5MDM4MTY1NTA5NzAxX25lYXIlMjBKZXJpY2hvJTIwVHBrZSUyQyUyMENvbW1hY2slMkMlMjBOZXclMjBZb3JrJTIwMTE3MjUlMkMlMjBVbml0ZWQlMjBTdGF0ZXNfX19hX35wb3MuNDAuNzY5NzMyNTk0NDkwMDVfLTczLjA1ODg0MTk3MzU0MzE3X19fX2FfJnJ0b3A9MH4wfjB+}}</ref>\n\nFrom there, NY&nbsp;454 turns to the southeast, intersecting with [[New York State Route 111|NY&nbsp;111]] (Wheeler Road) and narrowing to two lanes. After turning further to the south, the highway intersects with [[County Route 67 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;67]], the former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway. Here, NY&nbsp;454 returns to four lanes and meets the [[Long Island Expressway]] (Interstate&nbsp;495) and its frontage roads. The route enters the village of [[Islandia, New York|Islandia]] and enters a large commercial district, where the route intersects with [[County Route 100 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;100]] (Old Nichols Road). After crossing the [[Long Island Rail Road]], NY&nbsp;454 enters [[Connetquot River State Park]], bends to the east and traverses the park.

The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial for the last two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) of NY&nbsp;454. About three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY&nbsp;454 connects to the Sunrise Highway ([[New York State Route 27|NY&nbsp;27]]) at exit&nbsp;51, a partial interchange in [[Holbrook, New York|Holbrook]]. Here, the NY&nbsp;454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY&nbsp;27.

The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] was supportive, and on 28 June 1815 he wrote to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] suggesting:\n<blockquote> ... the expediency of giving to the non commissioned officers and soldiers engaged in the Battle of Waterloo a medal. I am convinced it would have the best effect in the army, and if the battle should settle our concerns, they will well deserve it.<ref name=Caw/></blockquote> \nOn 17 September 1815 Duke of Wellington wrote to the Secretary of State for War, stating:\n<blockquote>I recommend that we should all have the same medal, hung to the same ribbon as that now used with the [[Army Gold Medal|[Army Gold] Medal]].<ref name=Caw/></blockquote> \n\nThe medal was issued in 1816\u20131817 to every soldier present at one or more of the battles of [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]], [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Each soldier was also credited with two years extra service and pay, to count for seniority and pension purposes,<ref name=J86/> and were to be known as \"Waterloo Men\". \n\nThis was the first medal issued by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] to all soldiers present during an action. The [[Military General Service Medal]] commemorates earlier battles, but was not issued until 1848. The Waterloo Medal was also the first campaign medal awarded to the next-of-kin of men killed in action.<ref name=J86/> \n\nAt the time the medal was granted, when such things were not at all the norm, it was very popular with its recipients, though veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] may have felt felt aggrieved that those present only at Waterloo \u2013 many of them raw recruits \u2013 should receive such a public acknowledgement of their achievements. Meanwhile those who had undergone the labours and privations of the whole war, had had no recognition of their services beyond the thirteen votes of thanks awarded to them in Parliament. There was no doubt some truth in this discontent on the part of the old soldiers; at the same time British military pride had hitherto rebelled against the practice common in Continental armies, of conferring medals and distinctions on every man, or every regiment, who had simply done their duty in their respective services.{{sfn|Royal Numismatic Society|1869|p=111}} The medal was as much a symbol of the importance of the victory as it was of a desire to give general campaign medals to soldiers.\n\n==Number awarded==\nA total of 39,000 medals were produced, not all of which were awarded.<ref name=\"war\"/> About 6,000 were issued to cavalry; 4,000 to [[Foot_guards#British_Army|Foot Guards]]; 16,000 to infantry [[line regiment]]s; 5,000 to artillery and 6,500 to the King\u2019s German Legion.<ref>Collett, page 59</ref> With staff, [[Royal Engineers|Sappers and Miners]] and eight companies of the [[Royal Waggon Train]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Allied Order of Battle|url=http://napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html|website=Wellington's Army in 1815.|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> approximately 38,500 medals were awarded in total.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe medal is made of silver and is {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. [[Thomas Wyon]], recently appointed Chief Engraver to the [[Royal Mint]] was selected to design the medal. Originally the medals were to be awarded in bronze, but the decision was made at a late stage to produce them in fine silver.<ref name=Caw/>{{efn|name=Silv}}<br>The medal's design was as follows:<ref name=D58>Dorling, page 58</ref><ref name=J86>Joslin, page 86</ref>\n\nObverse: A left facing effigy of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] with the inscription <small>\"GEORGE P.

Many recipients replaced this with a more ornate silver suspension.\n\nRibbon: The {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide ribbon is crimson with dark blue edges, each approximately {{convert|7|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. This is the 'military ribbon' also used for the [[Army Gold Medal]] and later the [[Military General Service Medal]].

The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] was supportive, and on 28 June 1815 he wrote to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] suggesting:\n<blockquote> ... the expediency of giving to the non commissioned officers and soldiers engaged in the Battle of Waterloo a medal. I am convinced it would have the best effect in the army, and if the battle should settle our concerns, they will well deserve it.<ref name=Caw/></blockquote> \nOn 17 September 1815 Duke of Wellington wrote to the Secretary of State for War, stating:\n<blockquote>I recommend that we should all have the same medal, hung to the same ribbon as that now used with the [[Army Gold Medal|[Army Gold] Medal]].<ref name=Caw/></blockquote> \n\nThe medal was issued in 1816\u20131817 to every soldier present at one or more of the battles of [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]], [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Each soldier was also credited with two years extra service and pay, to count for seniority and pension purposes,<ref name=J86/> and were to be known as \"Waterloo Men\". \n\nThis was the first medal issued by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] to all soldiers present during an action. The [[Military General Service Medal]] commemorates earlier battles, but was not issued until 1848. The Waterloo Medal was also the first campaign medal awarded to the next-of-kin of men killed in action.<ref name=J86/> \n\nAt the time the medal was granted, when such things were not at all the norm, it was very popular with its recipients, though Veterans of the [[Peninsula War]] may have felt felt aggrieved that those present only at Waterloo \u2013 many of them raw recruits \u2013 should receive such a public acknowledgement of their achievements. Meanwhile those who had undergone the labours and privations of the whole war, had had no recognition of their services beyond the thirteen votes of thanks awarded to them in Parliament. There was no doubt some truth in this discontent on the part of the old soldiers; at the same time British military pride had hitherto rebelled against the practice common in Continental armies, of conferring medals and distinctions on every man, or every regiment, who had simply done their duty in their respective services.{{sfn|Royal Numismatic Society|1869|p=111}}\n\n==Number awarded==\nA total of 39,000 medals were produced, not all of which were awarded.<ref name=\"war\"/> About 6,000 were issued to cavalry; 4,000 to [[Foot_guards#British_Army|Foot Guards]]; 16,000 to infantry [[line regiment]]s; 5,000 to artillery and 6,500 to the King\u2019s German Legion.<ref>Collett, page 59</ref> With staff, [[Royal Engineers|Sappers and Miners]] and eight companies of the [[Royal Waggon Train]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Allied Order of Battle|url=http://napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html|website=Wellington's Army in 1815.|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> approximately 38,500 medals were awarded in total.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe medal is made of silver and is {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675 near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences.

Several colonial men were tortured and buried at [[Nine Men's Misery]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]] as part of the Indians' ritual torture of enemies. They also burned the settlement of Providence to the ground on March 29. At the same time, a small band of Indians infiltrated and burned part of Springfield while the militia was away.\n\n[[File:Early American Conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Colonists defending their settlement (non-contemporary depiction)]]\nThe settlements within the modern-day [[State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|state of Rhode Island]] became a literal island colony for a time as the settlements at [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] were sacked and burned, and the residents were driven to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]].

The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].

The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675 near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign. The nearby towns in Rhode Island provided care for the wounded until they could return to their homes.<ref>Leach (1954), ''Flintlock and Tomahawk'', pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n=== Mohawk intervention ===\nIn December 1675, Metacomet established a winter camp in [[Schaghticoke (village), New York|Schaghticoke]], New York.<ref name=\"eric17\">{{cite book|last1=Tougias|first1=Michael|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|date=2017|publisher=Countryman Press|isbn=1581574908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I422DAAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref> His reason for moving into New York has been attributed to a desire to enlist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] aid in the conflict.<ref name=\"drake\">{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=James|title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676|date=1999|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1558492240|page=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/122 122]|url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration}}</ref> Though New York was a non-belligerent, Governor [[Edmund Andros]] was nonetheless concerned at the arrival of the Wampanoag sachem.<ref name=\"eric17\"/> Either with Andros' sanction, or of their own accord, the Mohawk - traditional rivals of the Algonquian people - launched a surprise assault against a 500-warrior band under Metacomet's command the following February.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref name=\"drake\"/> The \"ruthless\" ''[[coup de main]]'' resulted in the death of between 70 and as many as 460 of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"barr\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/> His forces crippled, Metacomet withdrew to New England, pursued \"relentlessly\" by Mohawk forces who attacked Algonquian settlements and ambushed their supply parties.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Calloway|first1=Colin|title=After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1611680611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXrgK29zl2QC&dq}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Daniel|title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275984664|page=[https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73 73]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several months, fear of Mohawk attack led some Wampanoag to surrender to the colonists, and one historian described the decision of the Mohawk to engage Metacomet's forces as \"the blow that lost the war for Philip\".<ref name=\"drake\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/>\n\n===Indian campaign===\nIndians attacked and destroyed more settlements throughout the winter of 1675\u201376 in their effort to annihilate the colonists.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences. Many of the community's other houses were destroyed before the Indians retreated northward.\n\n=== Plymouth Plantation Campaign ===\n[[File:Site of Nine Men's Misery (Cumberland, Rhode Island).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Site of \"[[Nine Men's Misery]]\" in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]] where Captain Pierce's troops were tortured]]\nThe spring of 1676 marked the high point for the combined tribes when they attacked Plymouth Plantation on March 12.

They attacked three more settlements; [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]] (near Springfield), Marlborough, and Simsbury were attacked two weeks later. They killed Captain Pierce<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53528344| title=Capt Michael Pierce's Defeat (1615 - 1676) - Find a Grave Memorial| publisher=| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> and a company of Massachusetts soldiers between Pawtucket and the Blackstone's settlement. Several colonial men were tortured and buried at [[Nine Men's Misery]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]] as part of the Indians' ritual torture of enemies. They also burned the settlement of Providence to the ground on March 29. At the same time, a small band of Indians infiltrated and burned part of Springfield while the militia was away.\n\n[[File:Early American Conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Colonists defending their settlement (non-contemporary depiction)]]\nThe settlements within the modern-day [[State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|state of Rhode Island]] became a literal island colony for a time as the settlements at [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] were sacked and burned, and the residents were driven to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]].

The small towns of [[Northfield, Massachusetts|Northfield]], [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], and several others were abandoned as the surviving settlers retreated to the larger towns. The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period.

He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]].

The company was founded by [[Tim Bevan]] and [[Sarah Radclyffe]] in 1983. It produces feature films and several television productions. [[Eric Fellner]] and Tim Bevan are now the co chairmen of the company.\n\n==Company==\nWorking Title Films was co founded by producers Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. In 1992, [[PolyGram]] became the company's corporate backer.

An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-Dutch [[film studio]], PolyGram Films became a major Hollywood competitor. In 1998, [[Seagram]] sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. \n\nIn 1999, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment]], to form [[Universal Music Group]]. PolyGram Films was sold and folded into [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999. Although contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title's parent company [[NBCUniversal]].<ref name=skillset>{{Cite web|authorlink=http://www.skillset.org|title=Working Title \u2013 Skillset|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.skillset.org/film/stories/production/article_3457_1.asp}}</ref> \n\nWorking Title is headquartered in [[London]], and has an office in [[Los Angeles]], which is headed by producer [[Liza Chasin]].\n\n===WT<sup>2</sup> Productions===\nIn 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT<sup>2</sup>.

owned by [[Universal Pictures]]. The company was founded by [[Tim Bevan]] and [[Sarah Radclyffe]] in 1983. It produces feature films and several television productions. [[Eric Fellner]] and Tim Bevan are now the co chairmen of the company.\n\n==Company==\nWorking Title Films was co founded by producers Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. In 1992, [[PolyGram]] became the company's corporate backer. Radclyffe left Working Title, and [[Eric Fellner]], a fellow [[independent film]] producer, joined the company.<ref name=\"The producers\">{{cite news|title=Interview: Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, co-chairmen Working Title Films|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/16/business.hayfilmfestival2005|location=London|author=Higgins, Charlotte|date=16 April 2005|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe company produced a variety of films for [[PolyGram]]'s London based production company, [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-Dutch [[film studio]], PolyGram Films became a major Hollywood competitor. In 1998, [[Seagram]] sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. \n\nIn 1999, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment]], to form [[Universal Music Group]]. PolyGram Films was sold and folded into [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999. Although contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title's parent company [[NBCUniversal]].<ref name=skillset>{{Cite web|authorlink=http://www.skillset.org|title=Working Title \u2013 Skillset|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.skillset.org/film/stories/production/article_3457_1.asp}}</ref> \n\nWorking Title is headquartered in [[London]], and has an office in [[Los Angeles]], which is headed by producer [[Liza Chasin]].\n\n===WT<sup>2</sup> Productions===\nIn 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT<sup>2</sup>.
