He was the son of Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] and was killed in the Highlands at some time after the birth of his son. According to Stuart\u2019s later account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, who died three years later. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], who was also his father\u2019s grandfather.<ref name=dnb>Edward Irving Carlyle, \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref>\n\nJohn Ferdinand Smyth studied medicine at the  University of Edinburgh. He then emigrated to North America, and settled near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where he practised as a physician. The [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to the Crown, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[British Army]]. He served in several regiments in the rank of captain. At one time he commanded an armed sloop in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and at another raised a company of men for frontier work. More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/> \n\nAt the end of the war, in 1783, Smyth (as he then was) arrived in England and was awarded a pension of \u00a3300 a year. However, in 1784, allegations were made against him to the claims commissioners, and this pension was suspended, never to be reinstated. Impoverished, he took a job as a barrack-master and wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'', which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1786. In 1793 he adopted the name of Stuart and went on arguing his case to the government, without success.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1795, Stuart joined [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]] on an expedition to the [[West Indies]], where he was shipwrecked three times and fought at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]]. On his return to England, he learned that his financial claims were too old to succeed. Stuart continued to write.<ref name=dnb/> \n\n==Marriages and death==\nOn 23 October 1778, while he was Captain Smyth of the [[Queen's Rangers]], against her father\u2019s wishes Stuart married Abigail Haugewout, the 23-year-old daughter of Leffert Haugewout, a loyalist farmer of [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]]. They set up house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] and had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in October 1780, but by then Smyth was believed to have returned to England.

[[Sam Nujoma]], the first [[President of Namibia]] and then-Chancellor of the University conducted the groundbreaking ceremony at [[Ongwediva]] on 17 November 2007. The ceremony took place on a 13-hectare plot of land that had been donated to UNAM by the Ongwediva Town Council.\n\nIn January 2008, the National Planning Commission approved funding for the construction of phase 1 of the new Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FOET) in Ongwediva. Construction work began in April 2008 with emphasis on lecture rooms, staff offices, laboratories, IT facilities, student hostels, staff houses and other support facilities.
