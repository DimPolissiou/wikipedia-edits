The PSOE played a key role during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], being part of [[coalition government]] from 1931 to 1933 and from 1936 to 1939, when the Republic was defeated by [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

For a couple of decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. However, since the 1980s UGT has frequently criticized the economic policies of PSOE, even calling for several [[general strike|general strikes]] against PSOE governments on 14 December 1988,<ref name=History/> 28 May, 1992, 27 January 1994 and 29 September 2010, all jointly with the other major union, CCOO. The unions and the left have often criticized the economic policies of the PSOE for its liberal nature, have denounced the policies of deregulation and generalization of the precarious and temporary work, cuts in social benefits, such as unemployment and retirement, and the privatizations of big companies and public services.\n\nThe PSOE is a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and the [[Socialist International]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psoe.es/ambito/historiapsoe/docs/index.do?action=View&id=992|title=History of PSOE|publisher=PSOE own site|accessdate=11 July 2007|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623091245/http://www.psoe.es/ambito/historiapsoe/docs/index.do?action=View&id=992|archive-date=23 June 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the [[European Parliament]], PSOE's 20 [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) sit in the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D) [[Political groups of the European Parliament|European parliamentary group]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Restoration regime ===\n[[File:Pablo Iglesias dirigiendo la palabra \u00e1 los obreros antes de disolverse la manifestaci\u00f3n, de Camp\u00faa.jpg|thumb|left|Pablo Iglesias addressing the workers during a 1905 demonstration in Madrid]]\nPSOE was founded by [[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]] on 2 May 1879 in the [[Casa Labra]] tavern in Tetu\u00e1n Street near the [[Puerta del Sol]] at the centre of [[Madrid]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Vadillo|2007|p=32}}; {{Harvnb|\u00c1lvarez Junco|2018|pp=414\u2013415}}</ref> Iglesias was a typesetter who had become in contact in the past with the Spanish section of the [[International Workingmen's Association|International Working Men's Association]] and with [[Paul Lafargue]].{{Sfn|\u00c1lvarez Junco|2018|pp=414\u2013415}} The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people, on 20 July of that same year. The bulk of the growth of the PSOE and its affiliated trade union, the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT) was chiefly restricted to the [[Madrid]]-[[Biscay]]-[[Asturias]] triangle up until the 1910s.{{Sfn|Tu\u00f1\u00f3n de Lara|1990|p=239}} The obtaining of a seat at the Congress by Pablo Iglesias at the [[1910 Spanish general election|1910 legislative election]], in which the PSOE candidates presented within the broad [[Republican\u2013Socialist Conjunction]], became a development of great symbolical transcendence, and gave the party more publicity at the national level.{{Sfn|Robles Egea|2015}}\n\n[[File:Trade unionists in the penitentiary of Cartagena.jpg|thumb|Besteiro, Anguiano, Saborit and Largo Caballero in the prison of Cartagena (1918)]]\nThe party and the UGT took a leading role in the general strike of August 1917, in the context of the events of the [[Spanish crisis of 1917|1917 Crisis]] during the conservative government of [[Eduardo Dato]]. The strike was crushed by the army with the result of further undermining of the constitutional order;{{Sfn|Romero Salvad\u00f3|2010|pp=79-80}} the members of the organizing committee ([[Juli\u00e1n Besteiro]], [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], [[Daniel Anguiano]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Saborit]]), were accused of [[sedition]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].{{Sfn|Casanova|Gil Andr\u00e9s|2014|p=63}} Sent to the prison of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]],{{Sfn|Casanova|Gil Andr\u00e9s|2014|p=63}} they were released a year later, after being elected to the [[Congress of Deputies|Cortes]] in the [[1918 Spanish general election|1918 general election]].\nDuring the 1919\u22121921 \"Crisis of the Internationals\" the party experienced tensions between the members endorsing the Socialist International and the advocates for joining the [[Third International]]. Two consecutive splits of dissidents willing to join the Komintern, namely the [[Spanish Communist Party]] in 1920,{{Sfn|Heywood|2002|p=56}} and the [[Spanish Communist Workers' Party (1921)|Spanish Communist Workers' Party]] in 1921,{{Sfn|Heywood|2002|p=25}} broke away from the PSOE and soon merged to create the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE).\n\nThe party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.<ref>Kowalski, Werner.

The socialist presence remained in the rest of cabinets of the [[First Biennium|\"Social-Aza\u00f1ist Biennium\"]] (1931\u20131933).\n\nAfter the [[1933 Spanish general election|November 1933 general election]], which marked a win for the right-of-centre forces, in a climate of increasing polarization and growing unemployment, along with a desire to make amends for the mistake of not having sided with the republicans in the election against the united right, Largo Caballero adopted a [[revolutionary]] rhetoric.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=94\u201395}} Indalecio Prieto had also participated in the increasingly aggressive rhetoric, having already condemned the heavy-hand repression of the December 1933 largely anarchist uprising by the government, that has been cheered on by the [[CEDA]] parliamentary fraction leaders.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=101}} The [[Socialist Youth of Spain]] (JSE) also engaged into a shrilling revolutionary rhetoric, while Besteiro firmly opposed the insurrectionary drift of the militancy.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=102\u2013105}} \n[[File:Arrested workers during the Asturian Revolution, 1934.jpg|thumb|left|Workers arrested by [[Civil Guard (Spain)|civil guards]] and [[Guardia de Asalto|assault guards]] during the 1934 Asturian revolutionary strike.]]\nThe formation of a new cabinet that included CEDA ministers in October 1934 was perceived among the Left as a [[counter-revolutionary|reaction]],{{Sfn|Gil Pecharrom\u00e1n|2015|p=14}} with the CEDA party being indistinguishable from contemporary [[Fascism]] to most workers,{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=100}} while CEDA leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Gil-Robles]] had advocated the establishment of a corporative state already in the 1933 electoral campaign.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=92\u201393}} The UGT called for a nationwide general strike for 5 October, and this strike developed into a full-blown insurrection (the \"[[Revolution of 1934]]\") in the mining region of Asturias, which was vocally supported by socialists such as Largo Caballero and Prieto. After the end of the revolt, whose repression was entrusted to Generals [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and [[Manuel Goded|Goded]], most PSOE and UGT leaders were jailed.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=129; 132\u2013132}} \n[[File:Gobfrlargcabsept1936.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francisco Largo Caballero|Largo Caballero]] chairing a meeting of the Council of Ministers during wartime.]]\nA growing rift between Prieto and Largo Caballero (with disparate views of politics, albeit sharing a general pragmatist approach) formed in 1935 while Besteiro's hold on the party diminished significantly.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=133}} Followers of Indalecio Prieto would ultimately become \"estranged from the party left\".{{Sfn|Graham|1988|p=177}} The PSOE formed part of the broad left-wing [[Spanish Popular Front|Popular Front]] electoral coalition that [[1936 Spanish general election|stood for election in 1936]] and achieved a victory in seats over the right.\n\nIn September 1936, a few months into the 1936\u20131939 [[Spanish Civil War]], a cabinet presided over by Largo Caballero was formed (he also held the functions of Minister of War). In November, Largo Caballero succeeded in bringing some [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] members into his government. The left socialist ''caballeristas'' were revolutionary in rhetoric (although in reality they proposed moderate reformist policies while in government);{{Sfn|Graham|1988|p=177}} the [[May Days|May Events of 1937 in Barcelona]] destabilised the government, which was replaced by a new cabinet led by [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], another socialist.\n\n=== Clandestinity and exile ===\n[[File:Het congres van de SAI te Amsterdam Dhr Lopis namens de Spaanse socialisten, Bestanddeelnr 915-5132.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodolfo Llopis]] led the PSOE in exile for nearly three decades.]]\nWith the PSOE reduced to clandestinity during the [[Francoist dictatorship]], its members were persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or exiled and even executed.{{refn|group=n|Among others, the aging and ill Juli\u00e1n Besteiro, who preferred to stay in Spain over exile, died in a Francoist prison in 1940.

Negr\u00edn, whose 1937\u20131939 spell at the government in wartime was seen negatively by large elements of both ''caballerista'' and ''prietista'' extraction, had become vilified.{{sfn|Hoyos Puente|2016|pp=316\u2013317}} The party was re-organized along new lines in 1944 in the 1st Congress in Exile that took place in [[Toulouse]] and in which [[Rodolfo Llopis]] became the party's new Secretary General.{{Sfn|Hoyos Puente|2016|p=318}}\n\nThe PSOE congresses in exile during the post-war period were marked by strong [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]] positions, as a reflection of how the exiles remembered the last events of the Civil War (which featured bitter strifes with the communists) and in line with the stance of other parties of the Socialist International during the [[Cold War]], neglecting any kind of rapprochement with the PCE.{{Sfn|Bueno Aguado|2016|pp=334\u2013335}} The relative void left in Spain by the PSOE, with a Toulouse-based direction lacking in dynamism and innovation, was filled by the PCE and other new clandestine organizations such as the [[Agrupaci\u00f3n Socialista Universitaria]] (ASU), the [[Popular Liberation Front (Spain)|Popular Liberation Front]] (FELIPE), or, later, the [[Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n|Tierno Galv\u00e1n]]'s [[People's Socialist Party (Spain)|Socialist Party of the Interior]].{{Sfn|Bueno Aguado|2016|pp=335\u2013336}} The Toulouse executive board became increasingly detached from the party in Spain in the 1960s an insurmountable chasm between the former and the party in the interior was already defined by 1972.{{Sfn|Heywood|1987|pp=198-199}}\n\n===Modern history (1974\u2013present)===\nIts 25th Congress was held in [[Toulouse]] in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in [[Suresnes]], [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] was elected Secretary General, replacing Llopis. Gonz\u00e1lez was from the \"reform\" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who had not fought the war.<ref name=History/>\n[[File:Spaanse verkiezingen Felipe Gonzalez (PSOE) tijdens bijeenkomst, Bestanddeelnr 929-2260 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] during a speech in 1977]]\nLlopis led a schism to form the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic)]]. Gonz\u00e1lez showed intentions to move the party away from its Marxist and socialist background, turning PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the unofficial [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] leading party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]] (which until then it had been the [[Spanish Communist Party]], leading more aggressively among a larger representation of underground parties since the last free popular vote during the Civil War on Republican territory). Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the [[Popular Socialist Party (Spain)|Popular Socialist Party]] agreed to merge into PSOE.\n\nIn their 27th congress in May 1979, Gonz\u00e1lez resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September of that year, the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which Gonz\u00e1lez was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. Western European social-democratic parties supported Gonz\u00e1lez's stand, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] granted them money. PSOE party symbol was changed from the [[anvil with the book]] to the social-democratic [[Rose (symbolism)#Socialism and social democracy|rose]] in the [[Raised fist|fist]], as used by the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which was approved. In the [[1979 Spanish general election]] PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.\nOn 28 October [[1982 Spanish general election]], PSOE was victorious, with 48.1% of the vote (10,127,392 total). Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 2 December, a position he held until May 1996.\n\nThough the party had opposed [[NATO]], after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation. The Gonz\u00e1lez administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of ''North Atlantic Treaty Organisation'' and ''NATO'', using the unofficial ''Atlantic Alliance'' terms. A symbol of this U-turn is [[Javier Solana]] who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General.\n\nPSOE supported the United States in the [[Gulf War]] (1991). PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. Under the Gonzalez Administration, public expenditure on education, health, and pensions rose in total by 4.1 points of the country's GDP between 1982 and 1992.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&pg=PA183 |title=Regimes, Politics, and Markets: Democratization and Economic Change in Southern and Eastern Europe |first=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda |last=Maravall Herrero |access-date=9 February 2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |page=183 |isbn=9780198280835 |translator-first=Justin |translator-last=Byrne |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502222226/https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&pg=PA183 |archive-date=2 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEconomic crisis and [[state terrorism]] ([[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|GAL]]) against the violent separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eroded the popularity of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, and in 1996, PSOE lost the elections to the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in 2000 (34.7%). PSOE remained as the ruling party in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Andalusia]], Extremadura, [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[Asturias]].\n\nIn 2000, a new general secretary, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] (also known as ZP), was elected, renewing the party. Later, PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.\n\nPSOE strongly opposed the [[Iraq War]], which was supported by the Aznar government.\n\n[[File:Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at the Progressive Governance Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] during the 2010 Progressive Governance Conference]]\nOn 13 November 2003 PSOE ([[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]], PSC) increased its vote total but scored second in the regional election in [[Catalonia]], after [[Convergence and Union]]. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] and the [[United and Alternative Left]], and governed in Catalonia until 2010.\n\nOn 14 March 2004, PSOE won the [[2004 Spanish legislative election|2004 Spanish general election]] with almost 43% of the votes, following the [[11-M]] terrorist (11 March) attacks. It was alleged that the PSOE, with the help of the national newspaper ''El Pais,'' did not observe the \"reflection journey\" which forbade political parties from trying to sway public opinion (forbidden by Spanish law), calling the opposing political party \"assassins\" and blaming the terrorist attack on them. The PSOE maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2004/03/15/opinion/1079305201_850215.html|title=Editorial &#124; Vuelco electoral|first=Ediciones El|last=Pa\u00eds|date=15 March 2004|via=elpais.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eldiestro.es/2019/03/trece-anos-despues-del-11m-y-sigue-la-version-oficial-verdad-memoria-dignidad-justicia/|title=#RecordandoEl11M - Trece a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del 11M y sigue... la \"versi\u00f3n oficial\"|first=Antonio de la|last=Torre|date=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, PSOE called for a \"Yes\" vote on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]. PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] during the 2006 cease-fire, which had a de facto end with the [[Barajas Airport]] [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|terrorist attack]].\nOn 9 March 2008 PSOE won the [[2008 Spanish general election|2008 general elections]] again with Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero remaining Prime Minister of Spain. The Socialists increased their share of seats in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] from 164 to 169 after the latest election.\n[[File:Congr\u00e8s de S\u00e9ville du PSOE.jpg|thumb|PSOE leading figures during the [[2012 Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election|38th federal congress]] in which [[Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba]] (center) was elected Secretary General.]]\nHowever, after waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, PSOE were defeated in the [[2011 Spanish general election|general elections of November 2011]] by the conservative People's Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Shortly after, an extraordinary congress was held, in which [[Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba]], former Deputy to Zapatero and Minister of the Interior, was elected Secretary General defeating [[Carme Chac\u00f3n]], the other candidate, who stood for the Zapatero platform. This victory caused huge internal divisions and weakened the party's external image.\n\nIn 2013, PSOE held a political conference which introduced a completely new platform, widely seen as a move to the left in a desperate attempt to steal votes from parties such as [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], whose popularity rose steadily due to the general discontent with the two-party system and spending cuts. That platform was the basis for the [[2014 European Parliament election in Spain|European Parliament election]] manifesto, promoted as a solid alternative to the conservative plan for Europe. The expectations inside the party, which chose [[Elena Valenciano]] as their election candidate, were really optimistic; however, the social democrats suffered another huge defeat due to the appearance of new parties such as [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] which managed to gain the support of left-wing voters; PSOE won 14 seats. Shortly thereafter, Rubalcaba resigned as Secretary General and an [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party Extraordinary Federal Congress (2014)|Extraordinary Congress]] was convoked. This congress was the first to use a [[primary election]] system with three candidates: [[Pedro S\u00e1nchez]], [[Eduardo Madina]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e9rez-Tapias]]. S\u00e1nchez was elected with 49% of the vote of the affiliates and therefore became Secretary General on 27 July.\n\nIn [[2015 Spanish municipal elections|2015 municipal elections]], the PSOE won 25% of the vote, one of its worst results in since the restoration of democracy. Together with the fall of the [[People's Party (Spain)|Popular Party]], which won 27% of votes, it meant the end of the two-party system in Spain in favor of new parties. The PSOE alone lost 943 councilors.\n\nOn 20 December, the [[2015 Spanish general election|2015 general election]] was held, which produced a parliament broken into four major parties. PSOE, due to the large increase for parties like [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] (left) and [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]] (centre-right), got about 20% of the vote, its worst result since democracy was restored. Parliament was so fragmented, no government could be formed, and six months later [[2016 Spanish general election|new elections were held]]. The 2016 elections resulted in the PSOE losing a further five seats despite gaining 0.6% of the vote (still the party's second-worst popular vote total since the restoration of democracy, after 2015), leaving the party with 85 seats in Parliament, their lowest total since the restoration of democracy and the fewest since the [[1933 Spanish general election|elections of 1933]] in [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican Spain]] left the party with 59 seats in the 473-member parliament.\n\n[[File:Pedro-Sanchez-primarias-PSOE-Internacional EDIIMA20170522 0010 19.jpg|thumb|Pedro S\u00e1nchez (who led the party through its [[2016 PSOE crisis|crisis in 2016]]), after winning the 2017 primary election for Secretary-General, singing ''[[The Internationale]]''.]]\nWith the exception of the [[2015 Andalusian regional election|2015 Andalusian elections]], elections held during the early leadership of S\u00e1nchez were losses for the PSOE. In addition, the policy of pacts conducted by S\u00e1nchez after the general elections of 2016, based on S\u00e1nchez's outright refusal to facilitate a PP government, caused a faction within the party critical of S\u00e1nchez to rise in prominence. This faction was led by President of [[Andalusia]] [[Susana D\u00edaz]].\n\nOn September 28, 2016, the Secretary of Federal Policy, Antonio Pradas, went to the party's headquarters and presented the ''en bloc'' resignation of 17 members of the Federal Executive and the demands of those who resigned for the party to be run by an interim manager and to pressure Pedro S\u00e1nchez to resign as Secretary General. The Executive later lost two more members in the ''en bloc'' resignation, bringing the total number of resignations to 19. Resigning executives included the president of the party, [[Micaela Navarro]], the former Minister [[Carme Chac\u00f3n]], the President of [[Valencia]] [[Ximo Puig]] and the President of [[Castilla\u2013La Mancha]] [[Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page]]. This launched the [[2016 PSOE crisis]].\n\nOn the afternoon of 1 October 2016, after holding a tense Federal Committee meeting, Pedro S\u00e1nchez resigned as party General Secretary, forcing an [[2017 Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election|extraordinary party congress]] to choose a new General Secretary. That night it was reported that an interim manager would be chosen, later confirmed to be the President of [[Asturias]] [[Javier Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez]]. S\u00e1nchez announced his intention to run for General Secretary of the party, as did Susana D\u00edaz (one of the leaders of the anti-S\u00e1nchez faction of the party), and [[Patxi L\u00f3pez]], former President of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]].\n\nAt the [[39th PSOE Federal Congress|39th federal congress]] in June 2017, D\u00edaz received 48.3% of endorsements, outpacing both S\u00e1nchez (43.0% of endorsements) and L\u00f3pez (8.7% of endorsements), but S\u00e1nchez won an absolute majority of the party's popular vote, at 50.3% (D\u00edaz received 39.9% and L\u00f3pez 9.8%). Both D\u00edaz and L\u00f3pez withdrew before the delegate vote, returning S\u00e1nchez as the General Secretary of the PSOE and ending the crisis. S\u00e1nchez won every region of Spain, except for the home regions of L\u00f3pez and D\u00edaz.\n\nIn mid-2018, the [[Spanish National Court|National Court]] that found that the PP profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the [[G\u00fcrtel case]] thus confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party's official one since 1989 and that sentenced that the PP helped to establish \"a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central, autonomous and local public procurement.\" The PSOE Parliamentary Group in the Congress of Deputies filed a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no confidence against the PP government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy]], presenting S\u00e1nchez as alternative candidate. The PSOE's motion passed with the support of [[Unidos Podemos]] (UP), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC), [[Catalan European Democratic Party]] (PDeCAT), [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Coalici\u00f3 Comprom\u00eds]], [[EH Bildu]] and [[New Canaries]] (NCa), bringing down the Rajoy government. The PP voted against the proposal, joined by [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]] (C's), [[Navarrese People's Union]] (UPN) and [[Asturias Forum]] (FAC). [[Canarian Coalition]] (CC) abstained.\n\nFollowing the successful motion of no confidence, Pedro S\u00e1nchez became Prime Minister on 2 June 2018, in a minority government. In December 2018, the PSOE's [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party of Andalusia|branch in Andalusia]] was defeated in the [[2018 Andalusian regional election|Andalusian regional elections]] for the first time since the restoration of democracy, with a center-right coalition of PP, C's, and the resurgent right-wing nationalists [[Vox (political party)|VOX]] taking power in the region.\n\nFor most of his first term as Prime Minister, S\u00e1nchez relied on support from UP and NC to get his agenda passed, occasionally being forced into negotiating with the Catalan separatist parties ERC and PDeCAT and the PNV on individual issues. In February 2019, the ERC, PDeCAT and [[En Marea]] withdrew their support of S\u00e1nchez's government by voting against and helping defeat the 2019 [[General State Budget]], and S\u00e1nchez called [[April 2019 Spanish general election|an early election for 28 April 2019]].\n\nThe 2019 general election resulted in victory for the PSOE, with the party winning 123 seats on 28.7% of the vote in the Cortes and an absolute majority of 139 in the Senate, gains of 38 and 79 seats respectively. The PSOE also finished eight percentage points ahead of the PP, who finished second in seats, in the popular vote. At election night party supporters demanded S\u00e1nchez to reject any coalition with Cs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/29/inenglish/1556524692_006377.html|title=Spanish election results: What do the possible governing deals look like?|last=Pa\u00eds|first=El|date=2019-04-29|work=El Pa\u00eds|access-date=2019-04-29|language=en|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429101604/https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/29/inenglish/1556524692_006377.html|archive-date=29 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the same day as the 2019 general election, [[2019 Valencian regional election|Valencia held its regional election]], where the [[Socialist Party of the Valencian Country|Valencian branch of the PSOE]] was re-elected, in coalition with the [[Valencianism|Valencianist]] party [[Coalici\u00f3 Comprom\u00eds|Comprom\u00eds]] and UP.\n\nOn 26 May 2019, the PSOE became the largest Spanish party in the [[European Parliament]], following the [[2019 European Parliament election in Spain|European elections]]. The PSOE gained six seats to bring their total to 20, and won all but eight provinces in the country.\n\n26 May also saw [[2019 Spanish regional elections|regional elections]] for every region in the country except Valencia, Catalonia, Andalusia, the Basque Country and Galicia. In every region except for [[2019 Madrilenian regional election|Madrid]], the PSOE gained seats and votes from the 2015 elections. The PSOE finished first in terms of votes and seats in every region except for [[2019 Cantabrian regional election|Cantabria]], where the [[Regionalist Party of Cantabria]] (PRC) finished first and the PSOE third behind the PP, and [[2019 Navarrese regional election|Navarra]], where the conservative regionalist [[Navarra Suma|NA+]] finished first and the [[Socialist Party of Navarre]] finished second. PSOE governments were re-elected in [[2019 Castilian-Manchegan regional election|Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[2019 Extremaduran regional election|Extremadura]]. The PSOE received an absolute majority of seats in both regions. The party took over the Presidency of the [[2019 Canarian regional election|Canary Islands]] with the support of [[New Canaries]] and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], ending 26 years of [[Canarian Coalition]] government.\n\nOn the same date, the PSOE became the largest party in the [[List of municipalities of Spain|municipalities]], following the [[2019 Spanish local elections|local elections]].\n\nFollowing months of political deadlock, S\u00e1nchez called a [[November 2019 Spanish general election|second general election]] in 2019, held on 10 November. The PSOE lost only three members of parliament and 0.7% of the popular vote in the election, but the PP and VOX gained 23 and 28 seats respectively, further worsening the deadlock. As of 23 December, there is still no government in place, though members of PSOE, the PSC and the UP have voted overwhelmingly to join in a coalition government, agreed to by S\u00e1nchez and UP Secretary-General [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].\n\nOn 5 January 2020, the PSOE\u2013UP government failed its first investiture vote, with 166 votes in favor and 165 opposed with 18 abstentions and one UP parliamentarian absent; the government fell short of an absolute majority. On 7 January, the investiture motion \u2014 this time requiring only a [[Majority|simple majority]] \u2014 passed with 167 votes in favor and 165 against. The PSOE, UP, [[En Com\u00fa Podem]], [[Grupo Com\u00fan da Esquerda]], PNV, [[M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds]], Comprom\u00eds, NCa, the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG) and [[Teruel Existe]] (TE) voting in favor of the government.

The ideology of the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party has evolved throughout the 20th century according to relevant historical events and the evolution of Spanish society.\n\nIn 1979, the party abandoned its definitive Marxist thesis at the hands of its then secretary general [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]], not before overcoming great tensions and two congresses, the first of which preferred to maintain Marxism. Before this situation, notable internal leaders like Pablo Castellano or Luis G\u00f3mez Llorente founded the internal faction of Left Socialists, which included the militants who would not renounce Marxism. This allowed for the consolidation of the leftist forces in PSOE. From this moment, the diverse events both outside and within the party led to projects that resembled those of other European social democratic parties and acceptance of the defence of the market economy.\n\nCurrently, PSOE defines itself as \"[[Social democracy|social democratic]], [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]]\". It is grouped with other self-styled socialists, social democrats and labour parties in the [[Party of European Socialists]].\n\n===Federalism===\nDuring the Second Republic the matter of the conception of the State was open within the party: two different views connected in discourse to the interests of the working class competed against each other, a [[Centralism|centralist]] view as well as a [[Federalism|federal]] one.{{Sfn|Molina Jim\u00e9nez|2013|p=259}} The late years of the Francoist dictatorship was a period in which PSOE defended the right to \"self-determination of the peoples of Spain\", in that it was a reflection of both an ideologic and a pragmatist approach.{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=100}} Ultimately, the party, while sticking to a preference for a federal system, gradually ceased to mention the notion of self-determination during the [[Spanish transition|Spanish transition to democracy]].{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=101}} Postulates coming from peripheral nationalisms that have been assumed by elements of the party, bringing an understanding of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia as nations and thus, deserving of a different treatment than the rest of regions, have been heavily criticised by other party elements, as according to the latter, they would undermine the principle of territorial equality among the autonomous communities.{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=108}}\n\n==Electoral performance==\n\n===Cortes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| [[Cortes Generales#The Restoration (1874\u20131930)|Restoration Cortes]] (1876\u20131923)<br/>[[Cortes Generales#Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Republican Cortes]] (1931\u20131939)\n|-\n!

They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate in the past. Some barons were [[Pasqual Maragall]] ([[Catalonia]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2006; [[Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Ibarra]] ([[Extremadura]]), who did not run for re-election in 2007; [[Manuel Chaves (politician)|Manuel Chaves]] ([[Andalucia]]), who renounced Andalucia's presidency in 2009 to assume Third Vice Presidency of the Spanish Government; [[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]] ([[Catalonia]]), now opposition leader. The term bar\u00f3n is more colloquial than official, representing the great power regional leaders have in the party, but it has been falling out of use since 2008.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* ''Compa\u00f1ero'' (\"companion\", \"comrade\"): a term of address among Socialists, analogous to the English [[comrade]] and the Russian [[tovarisch]].\n* Currents: there have been several internal groups within PSOE, based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended with separation from PSOE. The failed trial of [[primary election]]s for PSOE candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents. Examples of currents are \"Guerristas\" (followers of [[Alfonso Guerra]]), \"[[Renovadores]]\" (renewers, right-wing of the party) or Izquierda Socialista (Socialist Left).\n\n== Historical leaders ==\n{| width=100%\n|- valign =\"top\"\n|width=30%|\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The PSOE played a key role during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], being part of [[coalition government]] from 1931 to 1933 and from 1936 to 1939, when the Republic was defeated by [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

For a couple of decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership.

Two consecutive splits of dissidents willing to join the Komintern, namely the [[Spanish Communist Party]] in 1920,{{Sfn|Heywood|2002|p=56}} and the [[Spanish Communist Workers' Party (1921)|Spanish Communist Workers' Party]] in 1921,{{Sfn|Heywood|2002|p=25}} broke away from the PSOE and soon merged to create the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE).\n\nThe party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.<ref>Kowalski, Werner.

The socialist presence remained in the rest of cabinets of the [[First Biennium|\"Social-Aza\u00f1ist Biennium\"]] (1931\u20131933).\n\nAfter the [[1933 Spanish general election|November 1933 general election]], which marked a win for the right-of-centre forces, in a climate of increasing polarization and growing unemployment, along with a desire to make amends for the mistake of not having sided with the republicans in the election against the united right, Largo Caballero adopted a [[revolutionary]] rhetoric.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=94\u201395}} Indalecio Prieto had also participated in the increasingly aggressive rhetoric, having already condemned the heavy-hand repression of the December 1933 largely anarchist uprising by the government, that has been cheered on by the [[CEDA]] parliamentary fraction leaders.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=101}} The [[Socialist Youth of Spain]] (JSE) also engaged into a shrilling revolutionary rhetoric, while Besteiro firmly opposed the insurrectionary drift of the militancy.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=102\u2013105}} \n[[File:Arrested workers during the Asturian Revolution, 1934.jpg|thumb|left|Workers arrested by [[Civil Guard (Spain)|civil guards]] and [[Guardia de Asalto|assault guards]] during the 1934 Asturian revolutionary strike.]]\nThe formation of a new cabinet that included CEDA ministers in October 1934 was perceived among the Left as a [[counter-revolutionary|reaction]],{{Sfn|Gil Pecharrom\u00e1n|2015|p=14}} with the CEDA party being indistinguishable from contemporary [[Fascism]] to most workers,{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=100}} while CEDA leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Gil-Robles]] had advocated the establishment of a corporative state already in the 1933 electoral campaign.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=92\u201393}} The UGT called for a nationwide general strike for 5 October, and this strike developed into a full-blown insurrection (the \"[[Revolution of 1934]]\") in the mining region of Asturias, which was vocally supported by socialists such as Largo Caballero and Prieto. After the end of the revolt, whose repression was entrusted to Generals [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and [[Manuel Goded|Goded]], most PSOE and UGT leaders were jailed.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|pp=129; 132\u2013132}} \n[[File:Gobfrlargcabsept1936.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francisco Largo Caballero|Largo Caballero]] chairing a meeting of the Council of Ministers during wartime.]]\nA growing rift between Prieto and Largo Caballero (with disparate views of politics, albeit sharing a general pragmatist approach) formed in 1935 while Besteiro's hold on the party diminished significantly.{{Sfn|Preston|1978|p=133}} Followers of Indalecio Prieto would ultimately become \"estranged from the party left\".{{Sfn|Graham|1988|p=177}} The PSOE formed part of the broad left-wing [[Spanish Popular Front|Popular Front]] electoral coalition that [[1936 Spanish general election|stood for election in 1936]] and achieved a victory in seats over the right.\n\nIn September 1936, a few months into the 1936\u20131939 [[Spanish Civil War]], a cabinet presided over by Largo Caballero was formed (he also held the functions of Minister of War). In November, Largo Caballero succeeded in bringing some [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] members into his government. The left socialist ''caballeristas'' were revolutionary in rhetoric (although in reality they proposed moderate reformist policies while in government);{{Sfn|Graham|1988|p=177}} the [[May Days|May Events of 1937 in Barcelona]] destabilised the government, which was replaced by a new cabinet led by [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], another socialist.\n\n=== Clandestinity and exile ===\n[[File:Het congres van de SAI te Amsterdam Dhr Lopis namens de Spaanse socialisten, Bestanddeelnr 915-5132.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodolfo Llopis]] led the PSOE in exile for nearly three decades.]]\nWith the PSOE reduced to clandestinity during the [[Francoist dictatorship]], its members were persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or exiled and even executed.{{refn|group=n|Among others, the aging and ill Juli\u00e1n Besteiro, who preferred to stay in Spain over exile, died in a Francoist prison in 1940.

Negr\u00edn, whose 1937\u20131939 spell at the government in wartime was seen negatively by large elements of both ''caballerista'' and ''prietista'' extraction, had become vilified.{{sfn|Hoyos Puente|2016|pp=316\u2013317}} The party was re-organized along new lines in 1944 in the 1st Congress in Exile that took place in [[Toulouse]] and in which [[Rodolfo Llopis]] became the party's new Secretary General.{{Sfn|Hoyos Puente|2016|p=318}}\n\nThe PSOE congresses in exile during the post-war period were marked by strong [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]] positions, as a reflection of how the exiles remembered the last events of the Civil War (which featured bitter strifes with the communists) and in line with the stance of other parties of the Socialist International during the [[Cold War]], neglecting any kind of rapprochement with the PCE.{{Sfn|Bueno Aguado|2016|pp=334\u2013335}} The relative void left in Spain by the PSOE, with a Toulouse-based direction lacking in dynamism and innovation, was filled by the PCE and other new clandestine organizations such as the [[Agrupaci\u00f3n Socialista Universitaria]] (ASU), the [[Popular Liberation Front (Spain)|Popular Liberation Front]] (FELIPE), or, later, the [[Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n|Tierno Galv\u00e1n]]'s [[People's Socialist Party (Spain)|Socialist Party of the Interior]].{{Sfn|Bueno Aguado|2016|pp=335\u2013336}} The Toulouse executive board became increasingly detached from the party in Spain in the 1960s an insurmountable chasm between the former and the party in the interior was already defined by 1972.{{Sfn|Heywood|1987|pp=198-199}}\n\n===Modern history (1974\u2013present)===\nIts 25th Congress was held in [[Toulouse]] in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in [[Suresnes]], [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] was elected Secretary General, replacing Llopis. Gonz\u00e1lez was from the \"reform\" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who had not fought the war.<ref name=History/>\n[[File:Spaanse verkiezingen Felipe Gonzalez (PSOE) tijdens bijeenkomst, Bestanddeelnr 929-2260 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] during a speech in 1977]]\nLlopis led a schism to form the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic)]]. Gonz\u00e1lez showed intentions to move the party away from its Marxist and socialist background, turning PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the unofficial [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] leading party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]] (which until then it had been the [[Spanish Communist Party]], leading more aggressively among a larger representation of underground parties since the last free popular vote during the Civil War on Republican territory). Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the [[Popular Socialist Party (Spain)|Popular Socialist Party]] agreed to merge into PSOE.\n\nIn their 27th congress in May 1979, Gonz\u00e1lez resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September of that year, the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which Gonz\u00e1lez was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. Western European social-democratic parties supported Gonz\u00e1lez's stand, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] granted them money. PSOE party symbol was changed from the [[anvil with the book]] to the social-democratic [[Rose (symbolism)#Socialism and social democracy|rose]] in the [[Raised fist|fist]], as used by the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which was approved. In the [[1979 Spanish general election]] PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.\nOn 28 October [[1982 Spanish general election]], PSOE was victorious, with 48.1% of the vote (10,127,392 total). Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 2 December, a position he held until May 1996.\n\nThough the party had opposed [[NATO]], after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation. The Gonz\u00e1lez administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of ''North Atlantic Treaty Organisation'' and ''NATO'', using the unofficial ''Atlantic Alliance'' terms. A symbol of this U-turn is [[Javier Solana]] who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General.\n\nPSOE supported the United States in the [[Gulf War]] (1991). PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. Under the Gonzalez Administration, public expenditure on education, health, and pensions rose in total by 4.1 points of the country's GDP between 1982 and 1992.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&pg=PA183 |title=Regimes, Politics, and Markets: Democratization and Economic Change in Southern and Eastern Europe |first=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda |last=Maravall Herrero |access-date=9 February 2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |page=183 |isbn=9780198280835 |translator-first=Justin |translator-last=Byrne |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502222226/https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&pg=PA183 |archive-date=2 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEconomic crisis and [[state terrorism]] ([[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|GAL]]) against the violent separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eroded the popularity of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, and in 1996, PSOE lost the elections to the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in 2000 (34.7%). PSOE remained as the ruling party in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Andalusia]], Extremadura, [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[Asturias]].\n\nIn 2000, a new general secretary, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] (also known as ZP), was elected, renewing the party. Later, PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.\n\nPSOE strongly opposed the [[Iraq War]], which was supported by the Aznar government.\n\n[[File:Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at the Progressive Governance Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] during the 2010 Progressive Governance Conference]]\nOn 13 November 2003 PSOE ([[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]], PSC) increased its vote total but scored second in the regional election in [[Catalonia]], after [[Convergence and Union]]. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] and the [[United and Alternative Left]], and governed in Catalonia until 2010.\n\nOn 14 March 2004, PSOE won the [[2004 Spanish legislative election|2004 Spanish general election]] with almost 43% of the votes, following the [[11-M]] terrorist (11 March) attacks. It was alleged that the PSOE, with the help of the national newspaper ''El Pais,'' did not observe the \"reflection journey\" which forbade political parties from trying to sway public opinion (forbidden by Spanish law), calling the opposing political party \"assassins\" and blaming the terrorist attack on them. The PSOE maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2004/03/15/opinion/1079305201_850215.html|title=Editorial &#124; Vuelco electoral|first=Ediciones El|last=Pa\u00eds|date=15 March 2004|via=elpais.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eldiestro.es/2019/03/trece-anos-despues-del-11m-y-sigue-la-version-oficial-verdad-memoria-dignidad-justicia/|title=#RecordandoEl11M - Trece a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del 11M y sigue... la \"versi\u00f3n oficial\"|first=Antonio de la|last=Torre|date=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, PSOE called for a \"Yes\" vote on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]. PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] during the 2006 cease-fire, which had a de facto end with the [[Barajas Airport]] [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|terrorist attack]].\nOn 9 March 2008 PSOE won the [[2008 Spanish general election|2008 general elections]] again with Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero remaining Prime Minister of Spain. The Socialists increased their share of seats in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] from 164 to 169 after the latest election.\n[[File:Congr\u00e8s de S\u00e9ville du PSOE.jpg|thumb|PSOE leading figures during the [[2012 Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election|38th federal congress]] in which [[Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba]] (center) was elected Secretary General.]]\nHowever, after waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, PSOE were defeated in the [[2011 Spanish general election|general elections of November 2011]] by the conservative People's Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Shortly after, an extraordinary congress was held, in which [[Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba]], former Deputy to Zapatero and Minister of the Interior, was elected Secretary General defeating [[Carme Chac\u00f3n]], the other candidate, who stood for the Zapatero platform. This victory caused huge internal divisions and weakened the party's external image.\n\nIn 2013, PSOE held a political conference which introduced a completely new platform, widely seen as a move to the left in a desperate attempt to steal votes from parties such as [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], whose popularity rose steadily due to the general discontent with the two-party system and spending cuts. That platform was the basis for the [[2014 European Parliament election in Spain|European Parliament election]] manifesto, promoted as a solid alternative to the conservative plan for Europe. The expectations inside the party, which chose [[Elena Valenciano]] as their election candidate, were really optimistic; however, the social democrats suffered another huge defeat due to the appearance of new parties such as [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] which managed to gain the support of left-wing voters; PSOE won 14 seats. Shortly thereafter, Rubalcaba resigned as Secretary General and an [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party Extraordinary Federal Congress (2014)|Extraordinary Congress]] was convoked. This congress was the first to use a [[primary election]] system with three candidates: [[Pedro S\u00e1nchez]], [[Eduardo Madina]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e9rez-Tapias]]. S\u00e1nchez was elected with 49% of the vote of the affiliates and therefore became Secretary General on 27 July.\n\nIn [[2015 Spanish municipal elections|2015 municipal elections]], the PSOE won 25% of the vote, one of its worst results in since the restoration of democracy. Together with the fall of the [[People's Party (Spain)|Popular Party]], which won 27% of votes, it meant the end of the two-party system in Spain in favor of new parties. The PSOE alone lost 943 councilors.\n\nOn 20 December, the [[2015 Spanish general election|2015 general election]] was held, which produced a parliament broken into four major parties. PSOE, due to the large increase for parties like [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] (left) and [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]] (centre-right), got about 20% of the vote, its worst result since democracy was restored. Parliament was so fragmented, no government could be formed, and six months later [[2016 Spanish general election|new elections were held]]. The 2016 elections resulted in the PSOE losing a further five seats despite gaining 0.6% of the vote (still the party's second-worst popular vote total since the restoration of democracy, after 2015), leaving the party with 85 seats in Parliament, their lowest total since the restoration of democracy and the fewest since the [[1933 Spanish general election|elections of 1933]] in [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican Spain]] left the party with 59 seats in the 473-member parliament.\n\n[[File:Pedro-Sanchez-primarias-PSOE-Internacional EDIIMA20170522 0010 19.jpg|thumb|Pedro S\u00e1nchez (who led the party through its [[2016 PSOE crisis|crisis in 2016]]), after winning the 2017 primary election for Secretary-General, singing ''[[The Internationale]]''.]]\nWith the exception of the [[2015 Andalusian regional election|2015 Andalusian elections]], elections held during the early leadership of S\u00e1nchez were losses for the PSOE. In addition, the policy of pacts conducted by S\u00e1nchez after the general elections of 2016, based on S\u00e1nchez's outright refusal to facilitate a PP government, caused a faction within the party critical of S\u00e1nchez to rise in prominence. This faction was led by President of [[Andalusia]] [[Susana D\u00edaz]].\n\nOn September 28, 2016, the Secretary of Federal Policy, Antonio Pradas, went to the party's headquarters and presented the ''en bloc'' resignation of 17 members of the Federal Executive and the demands of those who resigned for the party to be run by an interim manager and to pressure Pedro S\u00e1nchez to resign as Secretary General. The Executive later lost two more members in the ''en bloc'' resignation, bringing the total number of resignations to 19. Resigning executives included the president of the party, [[Micaela Navarro]], the former Minister [[Carme Chac\u00f3n]], the President of [[Valencia]] [[Ximo Puig]] and the President of [[Castilla\u2013La Mancha]] [[Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page]]. This launched the [[2016 PSOE crisis]].\n\nOn the afternoon of 1 October 2016, after holding a tense Federal Committee meeting, Pedro S\u00e1nchez resigned as party General Secretary, forcing an [[2017 Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election|extraordinary party congress]] to choose a new General Secretary. That night it was reported that an interim manager would be chosen, later confirmed to be the President of [[Asturias]] [[Javier Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez]]. S\u00e1nchez announced his intention to run for General Secretary of the party, as did Susana D\u00edaz (one of the leaders of the anti-S\u00e1nchez faction of the party), and [[Patxi L\u00f3pez]], former President of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]].\n\nAt the [[39th PSOE Federal Congress|39th federal congress]] in June 2017, D\u00edaz received 48.3% of endorsements, outpacing both S\u00e1nchez (43.0% of endorsements) and L\u00f3pez (8.7% of endorsements), but S\u00e1nchez won an absolute majority of the party's popular vote, at 50.3% (D\u00edaz received 39.9% and L\u00f3pez 9.8%). Both D\u00edaz and L\u00f3pez withdrew before the delegate vote, returning S\u00e1nchez as the General Secretary of the PSOE and ending the crisis. S\u00e1nchez won every region of Spain, except for the home regions of L\u00f3pez and D\u00edaz.\n\nIn mid-2018, the [[Spanish National Court|National Court]] that found that the PP profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the [[G\u00fcrtel case]] thus confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party's official one since 1989 and that sentenced that the PP helped to establish \"a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central, autonomous and local public procurement.\" The PSOE Parliamentary Group in the Congress of Deputies filed a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no confidence against the PP government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy]], presenting S\u00e1nchez as alternative candidate. The PSOE's motion passed with the support of [[Unidos Podemos]] (UP), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC), [[Catalan European Democratic Party]] (PDeCAT), [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Coalici\u00f3 Comprom\u00eds]], [[EH Bildu]] and [[New Canaries]] (NCa), bringing down the Rajoy government. The PP voted against the proposal, joined by [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]] (C's), [[Navarrese People's Union]] (UPN) and [[Asturias Forum]] (FAC). [[Canarian Coalition]] (CC) abstained.\n\nFollowing the successful motion of no confidence, Pedro S\u00e1nchez became Prime Minister on 2 June 2018, in a minority government. In December 2018, the PSOE's [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party of Andalusia|branch in Andalusia]] was defeated in the [[2018 Andalusian regional election|Andalusian regional elections]] for the first time since the restoration of democracy, with a center-right coalition of PP, C's, and the resurgent right-wing nationalists [[Vox (political party)|VOX]] taking power in the region.\n\nFor most of his first term as Prime Minister, S\u00e1nchez relied on support from UP and NC to get his agenda passed, occasionally being forced into negotiating with the Catalan separatist parties ERC and PDeCAT and the PNV on individual issues. In February 2019, the ERC, PDeCAT and [[En Marea]] withdrew their support of S\u00e1nchez's government by voting against and helping defeat the 2019 [[General State Budget]], and S\u00e1nchez called [[April 2019 Spanish general election|an early election for 28 April 2019]].\n\nThe 2019 general election resulted in victory for the PSOE, with the party winning 123 seats on 28.7% of the vote in the Cortes and an absolute majority of 139 in the Senate, gains of 38 and 79 seats respectively. The PSOE also finished eight percentage points ahead of the PP, who finished second in seats, in the popular vote. At election night party supporters demanded S\u00e1nchez to reject any coalition with Cs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/29/inenglish/1556524692_006377.html|title=Spanish election results: What do the possible governing deals look like?|last=Pa\u00eds|first=El|date=2019-04-29|work=El Pa\u00eds|access-date=2019-04-29|language=en|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429101604/https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/29/inenglish/1556524692_006377.html|archive-date=29 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the same day as the 2019 general election, [[2019 Valencian regional election|Valencia held its regional election]], where the [[Socialist Party of the Valencian Country|Valencian branch of the PSOE]] was re-elected, in coalition with the [[Valencianism|Valencianist]] party [[Coalici\u00f3 Comprom\u00eds|Comprom\u00eds]] and UP.\n\nOn 26 May 2019, the PSOE became the largest Spanish party in the [[European Parliament]], following the [[2019 European Parliament election in Spain|European elections]]. The PSOE gained six seats to bring their total to 20, and won all but eight provinces in the country.\n\n26 May also saw [[2019 Spanish regional elections|regional elections]] for every region in the country except Valencia, Catalonia, Andalusia, the Basque Country and Galicia. In every region except for [[2019 Madrilenian regional election|Madrid]], the PSOE gained seats and votes from the 2015 elections. The PSOE finished first in terms of votes and seats in every region except for [[2019 Cantabrian regional election|Cantabria]], where the [[Regionalist Party of Cantabria]] (PRC) finished first and the PSOE third behind the PP, and [[2019 Navarrese regional election|Navarra]], where the conservative regionalist [[Navarra Suma|NA+]] finished first and the [[Socialist Party of Navarre]] finished second. PSOE governments were re-elected in [[2019 Castilian-Manchegan regional election|Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[2019 Extremaduran regional election|Extremadura]]. The PSOE received an absolute majority of seats in both regions. The party took over the Presidency of the [[2019 Canarian regional election|Canary Islands]] with the support of [[New Canaries]] and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], ending 26 years of [[Canarian Coalition]] government.\n\nOn the same date, the PSOE became the largest party in the [[List of municipalities of Spain|municipalities]], following the [[2019 Spanish local elections|local elections]].\n\nFollowing months of political deadlock, S\u00e1nchez called a [[November 2019 Spanish general election|second general election]] in 2019, held on 10 November. The PSOE lost only three members of parliament and 0.7% of the popular vote in the election, but the PP and VOX gained 23 and 28 seats respectively, further worsening the deadlock. As of 23 December, there is still no government in place, though members of PSOE, the PSC and the UP have voted overwhelmingly to join in a coalition government, agreed to by S\u00e1nchez and UP Secretary-General [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].\n\nOn 5 January 2020, the PSOE\u2013UP government failed its first investiture vote, with 166 votes in favor and 165 opposed with 18 abstentions and one UP parliamentarian absent; the government fell short of an absolute majority. On 7 January, the investiture motion \u2014 this time requiring only a [[Majority|simple majority]] \u2014 passed with 167 votes in favor and 165 against. The PSOE, UP, [[En Com\u00fa Podem]], [[Grupo Com\u00fan da Esquerda]], PNV, [[M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds]], Comprom\u00eds, NCa, the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG) and [[Teruel Existe]] (TE) voting in favor of the government. PP, Vox, Cs, [[Junts per Catalunya]] (JxCAT), [[Popular Unity Candidacy]] (CUP), NA+, CC, PRC and FAC voted against, while ERC and EH Bildu each abstained.\n\n==Political ideation==\n===From Marxism to social democracy===\n[[File:Pablo Iglesias, de Compa\u00f1y.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]] founded the party in 1879]]\nPSOE was founded with the purpose of representing and defending the interests of the [[proletariat|working class]] formed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In its beginnings, PSOE's main objective was the defense of worker's rights and the achievement of the ideals of [[socialism]], emerging from contemporary philosophy and [[Marxism|Marxist]] politics, by securing [[Power (social and political)|political power]] for the [[working class]] and [[Socialization|socialising]] the [[means of production]] in order to establish a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in the transition to socialist society. The ideology of the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party has evolved throughout the 20th century according to relevant historical events and the evolution of Spanish society.\n\nIn 1979, the party abandoned its definitive Marxist thesis at the hands of its then secretary general [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]], not before overcoming great tensions and two congresses, the first of which preferred to maintain Marxism. Before this situation, notable internal leaders like Pablo Castellano or Luis G\u00f3mez Llorente founded the internal faction of Left Socialists, which included the militants who would not renounce Marxism. This allowed for the consolidation of the leftist forces in PSOE. From this moment, the diverse events both outside and within the party led to projects that resembled those of other European social democratic parties and acceptance of the defence of the market economy.\n\nCurrently, PSOE defines itself as \"[[Social democracy|social democratic]], [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]]\". It is grouped with other self-styled socialists, social democrats and labour parties in the [[Party of European Socialists]].\n\n===Federalism===\nDuring the Second Republic the matter of the conception of the State was open within the party: two different views connected in discourse to the interests of the working class competed against each other, a [[Centralism|centralist]] view as well as a [[Federalism|federal]] one.{{Sfn|Molina Jim\u00e9nez|2013|p=259}} The late years of the Francoist dictatorship was a period in which PSOE defended the right to \"self-determination of the peoples of Spain\", in that it was a reflection of both an ideologic and a pragmatist approach.{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=100}} Ultimately, the party, while sticking to a preference for a federal system, gradually ceased to mention the notion of self-determination during the [[Spanish transition|Spanish transition to democracy]].{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=101}} Postulates coming from peripheral nationalisms that have been assumed by elements of the party, bringing an understanding of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia as nations and thus, deserving of a different treatment than the rest of regions, have been heavily criticised by other party elements, as according to the latter, they would undermine the principle of territorial equality among the autonomous communities.{{Sfn|Quiroga Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto|2008|p=108}}\n\n==Electoral performance==\n\n===Cortes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| [[Cortes Generales#The Restoration (1874\u20131930)|Restoration Cortes]] (1876\u20131923)<br/>[[Cortes Generales#Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Republican Cortes]] (1931\u20131939)\n|-\n!

They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate in the past. Some barons were [[Pasqual Maragall]] ([[Catalonia]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2006; [[Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Ibarra]] ([[Extremadura]]), who did not run for re-election in 2007; [[Manuel Chaves (politician)|Manuel Chaves]] ([[Andalucia]]), who renounced Andalucia's presidency in 2009 to assume Third Vice Presidency of the Spanish Government; [[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]] ([[Catalonia]]), now opposition leader. The term bar\u00f3n is more colloquial than official, representing the great power regional leaders have in the party, but it has been falling out of use since 2008.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* ''Compa\u00f1ero'' (\"companion\", \"comrade\"): a term of address among Socialists, analogous to the English [[comrade]] and the Russian [[tovarisch]].\n* Currents: there have been several internal groups within PSOE, based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended with separation from PSOE. The failed trial of [[primary election]]s for PSOE candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents. Examples of currents are \"Guerristas\" (followers of [[Alfonso Guerra]]), \"[[Renovadores]]\" (renewers, right-wing of the party) or Izquierda Socialista (Socialist Left).\n\n== Historical leaders ==\n{| width=100%\n|- valign =\"top\"\n|width=30%|\n{| class=wikitable\n!

{"title_page": "Water activity", "text_new": "{{Food safety}}\n{{about|food science|a more general discussion|thermodynamic activity}}\n\n'''Water activity''' ('''''a<sub>w</sub>''''') is the [[partial pressure|partial]] [[vapor pressure]] of water in a substance divided by the standard state partial [[vapor pressure of water]]. In the field of [[food science]], the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same [[temperature]]. Using this particular definition, pure [[distilled water]] has a water activity of exactly one.  As temperature increases, a<sub>w</sub> typically increases, except in some products with crystalline [[salt]] or [[sugar]].\n\nHigher a<sub>w</sub> substances tend to support more [[microorganisms]].\n\nWater migrates from areas of high a<sub>w</sub> to areas of low a<sub>w</sub>. For example, if [[honey]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.6) is exposed to humid [[air]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.7), the honey [[hygroscopy|absorbs water from the air]]. If [[salami]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.87) is exposed to dry air (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.5), the salami [[desiccation|dries out]], which could [[drying (food)|preserve]] it or [[staling|spoil]] it.\n\n==Formula==\nDefinition of a<sub>w</sub>:\n:<math> a_w \\equiv p / p* </math>\nwhere ''p'' is the partial vapor pressure of water in the solution, and ''p*'' is the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.\n\nAlternate definition:\n:<math> a_w \\equiv l_w x_w </math>\nwhere ''l''<sub>w</sub> is the [[activity coefficient]] of water and ''x''<sub>w</sub> is the mole fraction of water in the aqueous fraction.\n\nRelationship to [[relative humidity]]:\nThe relative humidity of air in equilibrium with a sample is called the Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH).<ref name=\"isbn0-632-05327-5\">{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Linda |last2=Cauvain |first2=Stanley P. |title=Bakery food manufacture and quality: water control and effects |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-632-05327-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n:<math> \\mathrm{ERH} = a_w \\times 100\\% </math>\n\nEstimated mold-free shelf life in days at 21\u00b0 C:\n:<math> \\mathrm{MFSL} = 10^{7.91 - 8.1 a_w} </math><ref name=\"isbn0-834-21782-1\">{{cite book |last1=Man |first1=C.M.D. |last2=Jones |first2=Adrian A. |title=Shelf Life Evaluation of Foods |publisher=Springer |location= |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-834-21782-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nWater activity is an important consideration for food product design and food safety.\n\n===Food product design===\nFood designers use water activity to formulate [[shelf-stable food]]. If a product is kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This results in a longer [[shelf life]].\n\nWater activity values can also help limit [[moisture migration]] within a food product made with different [[ingredient]]s. If raisins of a higher water activity are packaged with bran flakes of a lower water activity, the water from the raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the bran flakes soggy. Food formulators use water activity to predict how much moisture migration affects their product.\n\n===Food safety===\nWater activity is used in many cases as a [[critical control point]] for [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP) programs. Samples of the food product are periodically taken from the production area and tested to ensure water activity values are within a specified range for food quality and safety. Measurements can be made in as little as five minutes, and are made regularly in most major food production facilities.\n\nFor many years, researchers tried to equate bacterial growth potential with [[water content]]. They found that the values were not universal, but specific to each food product. W. J. Scott first established that [[bacterial growth]] correlated with water activity, not water content, in 1953. It is firmly established that growth of bacteria is inhibited at specific water activity values. U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations for [[intermediate moisture food]]s are based on these values.\n\nLowering the water activity of a food product should not be seen as a [[kill step]]. Studies in [[powdered milk]] show that viable cells can exist at much lower water activity values, but that they never grow.{{Cn|date=February 2013}} Over time, bacterial levels decline.\n\n==Measurement==\nWater activity values are obtained by either a resistive electrolytic, a [[capacitance]] or a [[dew point]] [[hygrometer]].\n\n===Resistive electrolytic hygrometers===\nResistive electrolytic hygrometers use a sensing element in the form of a liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force. The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water activity of the sample (once [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] is established). This relation can be checked by either a [[verification and validation|verification]] or [[calibration]] using salt-water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in the measurement chamber.\n\nThe sensor does not have any physically given hysteresis as it is known from capacitance hygrometers and sensors, and does not require regular cleaning as its surface is not the effectively sensing element. Volatiles, in principle, influence the measurement performance\u2014especially those that [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] in the electrolyte and thereby change its resistance. Such influences can easily be avoided by using chemical protection filters that absorb the volatile compound before arriving at the sensor.\n\n===Capacitance hygrometers===\nCapacitance hygrometers consist of two charged plates separated by a [[polymeric membrane|polymer membrane]] [[dielectric]]. As the membrane adsorbs water, its ability to hold a [[electric charge|charge]] increases and the capacitance is measured. This value is roughly proportional to the water activity as determined by a sensor-specific [[calibration]].\n\nCapacitance hygrometers are not affected by most [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals and can be much smaller than other alternative sensors. They do not require cleaning, but are less accurate than dew point hygrometers (+/- 0.015 a<sub>w</sub>). They should have regular calibration checks and can be affected by residual water in the polymer membrane (hysteresis).\n\n===Dew point hygrometers===\n[[File:Relative Humidity.png|thumb|400px|right|Red line shows saturation]]\nThe temperature at which [[dew]] forms on a clean surface is directly related to the [[vapor pressure]] of the air. Dew point hygrometers work by placing a mirror over a closed sample chamber. The mirror is cooled until the dew point temperature is measured by means of an [[optical sensor]]. This temperature is then used to find the [[relative humidity]] of the chamber using [[psychrometrics]] charts.\n\nThis method is theoretically the most accurate (+/- 0.003 a<sub>w</sub>) and often the fastest. The sensor requires cleaning if debris accumulates on the mirror.\n\n===Equilibration===\nWith either method, [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] must occur in the sample chamber. This takes place over time or can be aided by the addition of a fan in the chamber. [[Thermal equilibrium]] must also take place unless the sample temperature is measured.\n\n==Moisture content==\nWater activity is related to [[water content]] in a [[nonlinear system|non-linear relationship]] known as a [[moisture sorption isotherm]] curve. These isotherms are substance- and temperature-specific. Isotherms can be used to help predict product stability over time in different storage conditions.\n\n==Use in humidity control==\nThere is net evaporation from a solution with a water activity greater than the relative humidity of its surroundings. There is net absorption of water by a solution with a water activity less than the relative humidity of its surroundings. Therefore, in an enclosed space, a solution can be used to regulate humidity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Demchick|first=P.

In the field of [[food science]], the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same [[temperature]]. Using this particular definition, pure [[distilled water]] has a water activity of exactly one.  As temperature increases, a<sub>w</sub> typically increases, except in some products with crystalline [[salt]] or [[sugar]].\n\nHigher a<sub>w</sub> substances tend to support more [[microorganisms]]\nWater migrates from areas of high a<sub>w</sub> to areas of low a<sub>w</sub>. For example, if [[honey]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.6) is exposed to humid [[air]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.7), the honey [[hygroscopy|absorbs water from the air]]. If [[salami]] (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.87) is exposed to dry air (a<sub>w</sub> \u2248 0.5), the salami [[desiccation|dries out]], which could [[drying (food)|preserve]] it or [[staling|spoil]] it.\n\n==Formula==\nDefinition of a<sub>w</sub>:\n:<math> a_w \\equiv p / p* </math>\nwhere ''p'' is the partial vapor pressure of water in the solution, and ''p*'' is the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.\n\nAlternate definition:\n:<math> a_w \\equiv l_w x_w </math>\nwhere ''l''<sub>w</sub> is the [[activity coefficient]] of water and ''x''<sub>w</sub> is the mole fraction of water in the aqueous fraction.\n\nRelationship to [[relative humidity]]:\nThe relative humidity of air in equilibrium with a sample is called the Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH).<ref name=\"isbn0-632-05327-5\">{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Linda |last2=Cauvain |first2=Stanley P. |title=Bakery food manufacture and quality: water control and effects |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-632-05327-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n:<math> \\mathrm{ERH} = a_w \\times 100\\% </math>\n\nEstimated mold-free shelf life in days at 21\u00b0 C:\n:<math> \\mathrm{MFSL} = 10^{7.91 - 8.1 a_w} </math><ref name=\"isbn0-834-21782-1\">{{cite book |last1=Man |first1=C.M.D. |last2=Jones |first2=Adrian A. |title=Shelf Life Evaluation of Foods |publisher=Springer |location= |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-834-21782-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nWater activity is an important consideration for food product design and food safety.\n\n===Food product design===\nFood designers use water activity to formulate [[shelf-stable food]]. If a product is kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This results in a longer [[shelf life]].\n\nWater activity values can also help limit [[moisture migration]] within a food product made with different [[ingredient]]s. If raisins of a higher water activity are packaged with bran flakes of a lower water activity, the water from the raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the bran flakes soggy. Food formulators use water activity to predict how much moisture migration affects their product.\n\n===Food safety===\nWater activity is used in many cases as a [[critical control point]] for [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP) programs. Samples of the food product are periodically taken from the production area and tested to ensure water activity values are within a specified range for food quality and safety. Measurements can be made in as little as five minutes, and are made regularly in most major food production facilities.\n\nFor many years, researchers tried to equate bacterial growth potential with [[water content]]. They found that the values were not universal, but specific to each food product. W. J. Scott first established that [[bacterial growth]] correlated with water activity, not water content, in 1953. It is firmly established that growth of bacteria is inhibited at specific water activity values. U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations for [[intermediate moisture food]]s are based on these values.\n\nLowering the water activity of a food product should not be seen as a [[kill step]]. Studies in [[powdered milk]] show that viable cells can exist at much lower water activity values, but that they never grow.{{Cn|date=February 2013}} Over time, bacterial levels decline.\n\n==Measurement==\nWater activity values are obtained by either a resistive electrolytic, a [[capacitance]] or a [[dew point]] [[hygrometer]].\n\n===Resistive electrolytic hygrometers===\nResistive electrolytic hygrometers use a sensing element in the form of a liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force. The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water activity of the sample (once [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] is established). This relation can be checked by either a [[verification and validation|verification]] or [[calibration]] using salt-water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in the measurement chamber.\n\nThe sensor does not have any physically given hysteresis as it is known from capacitance hygrometers and sensors, and does not require regular cleaning as its surface is not the effectively sensing element. Volatiles, in principle, influence the measurement performance\u2014especially those that [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] in the electrolyte and thereby change its resistance. Such influences can easily be avoided by using chemical protection filters that absorb the volatile compound before arriving at the sensor.\n\n===Capacitance hygrometers===\nCapacitance hygrometers consist of two charged plates separated by a [[polymeric membrane|polymer membrane]] [[dielectric]]. As the membrane adsorbs water, its ability to hold a [[electric charge|charge]] increases and the capacitance is measured. This value is roughly proportional to the water activity as determined by a sensor-specific [[calibration]].\n\nCapacitance hygrometers are not affected by most [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals and can be much smaller than other alternative sensors. They do not require cleaning, but are less accurate than dew point hygrometers (+/- 0.015 a<sub>w</sub>). They should have regular calibration checks and can be affected by residual water in the polymer membrane (hysteresis).\n\n===Dew point hygrometers===\n[[File:Relative Humidity.png|thumb|400px|right|Red line shows saturation]]\nThe temperature at which [[dew]] forms on a clean surface is directly related to the [[vapor pressure]] of the air. Dew point hygrometers work by placing a mirror over a closed sample chamber. The mirror is cooled until the dew point temperature is measured by means of an [[optical sensor]]. This temperature is then used to find the [[relative humidity]] of the chamber using [[psychrometrics]] charts.\n\nThis method is theoretically the most accurate (+/- 0.003 a<sub>w</sub>) and often the fastest. The sensor requires cleaning if debris accumulates on the mirror.\n\n===Equilibration===\nWith either method, [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] must occur in the sample chamber. This takes place over time or can be aided by the addition of a fan in the chamber. [[Thermal equilibrium]] must also take place unless the sample temperature is measured.\n\n==Moisture content==\nWater activity is related to [[water content]] in a [[nonlinear system|non-linear relationship]] known as a [[moisture sorption isotherm]] curve. These isotherms are substance- and temperature-specific. Isotherms can be used to help predict product stability over time in different storage conditions.\n\n==Use in humidity control==\nThere is net evaporation from a solution with a water activity greater than the relative humidity of its surroundings. There is net absorption of water by a solution with a water activity less than the relative humidity of its surroundings. Therefore, in an enclosed space, a solution can be used to regulate humidity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Demchick|first=P.

As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.
