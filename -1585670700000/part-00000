Pr\u00edo, seeing no constitutional basis to act, did not do so. The rumors proved to be true.

[[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]] and [[Kedgwick, New Brunswick|Kedgwick]] are other towns along the route. With the exception of those towns, the highway runs almost entirely through sparsely populated forest land. It is the only highway connecting northwestern [[New Brunswick]] with the province's north shore.\n\n== History ==\n\nOver several decades, Route 17 has received several upgrades, and new sections of road built, to improve safety. These upgrades have been designed to meet present-day standards, including flatter grades, creation of more passing lanes, upgrades to guard rail requirements and increased shoulder widths. Some examples of these, have been the new alignments of the highway north of [[Saint-L\u00e9onard, New Brunswick|Saint-Leonard]], or the bypassing of [[Dawsonville, New Brunswick|Dawsonville]], west of [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/dti/highways_roads/content/projects/violette_brook_magee_road.html|title=Route 17 Upgrades Violette Brook to Magee Road|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/dti/highways_roads/content/projects/north_mud_brook.html|title=Route 17 Upgrades North of Mud Brook to Hammond Gate Road Area|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Route description ==\nRoute 17's northern terminus is at a T intersection with Route 11 in [[Glencoe, Restigouche County|Glencoe]]  (Route 17 is a continuation of the Route 11 direct right of way.) It runs southwesterly from there,    passing through the communities of [[Glen Levit, New Brunswick|Glen Levit]], and [[Squaw Cap, New Brunswick|Squaw Cap]]. Between the two communities, is a new section of highway, opened in the early 2000s bypassing Dawsonville, and adhering to modern highway standards.\n\nAfter roughly 19 kilometres, Route 17 crosses the [[Upsalquitch River]], and passes through [[Robinsonville, New Brunswick|Robinsonville]], before climbing Upsalquitch Hill. With an 11% grade, it is the steepest arterial highway grade in the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/@47.8506205,-67.0064356,3a,34.1y,101.63h,88.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHNxgR-v5pbCIOaoeEPuR2w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656|title=NB-17 Google Maps Street View|last=|first=|date=August 2018|website=Google Maps|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAtop of the hill, the road passes through [[Glenwood, Restigouche County|Glenwood]]. Southwest of Glenwood, the highway descends and then climbs  back up [[Adams Gulch, New Brunswick|Adams Gulch]], while passing through the community of the same name. After running west in the wilderness for almost 10 kilometres, Route 17 passes through [[Menneval, New Brunswick|Menneval]], then [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-Restigouche|Saint-Jean-Baptiste]], before heading through [[Kedgwick, New Brunswick|Kedgwick]], where there is a sharp 90 degree turn. Once past Kedgwick, Route 17 turns south, due for the town of [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]].\n\nAfter Saint-Quentin, the highway heads in a southwesterly manner once more and heads through wilderness, with only J.D. Irving's Sawmill in Veneer, in that stretch of woods. Approximately 50 kilometres later, Route 17 hits civilization in Saint-Leonard-Parent, nearing its southern terminus. Roughly 10 kilometres to the southwest, the highway reaches the town of [[Saint-L\u00e9onard, New Brunswick|Saint-Leonard]]. Passing under the [[New Brunswick Route 2|Trans-Canada Highway]], Route 17 continues to the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], where it reaches it southern terminus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/47.960568,-66.788235/47.1598023,-67.9302954/@47.9301981,-66.8883708,16984m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0|title=Google Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe speed limit varies throughout the route, from 50&nbsp;km/h in [[Kedgwick, New Brunswick|Kedgwick]] and [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]], to 90&nbsp;km/h, on many rural and uninhabited stretches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/@47.6458175,-67.344298,3a,15.8y,294.21h,87.51t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1si26aSItNSbiX0Qsoo6h_pA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656|title=Google Maps {{!}} Street View -

The station is currently owned by Stone Canyon Media Group.\n\n==History==\nKFLX started as a [[construction permit]] granted to Ted Tucker and his Desert West Air Ranchers Corporation for a new station on 105.1 kHz in [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]] with the call letters '''KTDX'''. Tucker was able to shoehorn KTDX into the more populous Flagstaff market (city of license: [[Kachina Village, Arizona|Kachina Village]]) and changed the call letters to KFLX. The construction permit changed hands to D.B. Broadcasting in 1994, then to Red Rock Communications a year later. Red Rock signed the station on with an [[Adult album alternative]] format named \"The Eagle\". Toward the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, KFLX morphed into an adult alternative/[[Modern AC]] hybrid similar to that of Phoenix's [[KALV-FM|KZON]]. \n\nRed Rock continued to own the station until it and sisters KWMX-FM and KSED-FM were sold in 2007 to Grenax Broadcasting II, LLC who also owned [[WCFX]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant, MI]].

On that day at that time, KFLX began playing sound clips of songs, commercials and TV shows from the 1980s, and introduced an 80's hits format on the stations, branded as \"Rewind 92.5 & 104.1\". The last 2 songs on The Canyon were ''[[It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)]]'' by [[R.E.M]] and the first 90 seconds of ''[[A Change Would Do You Good]]'' by [[Sheryl Crow]].

She was canoness of [[Remiremont]]. \n\nIn 1759, she married [[Duke of Gramont| Antoine VII, Duke of Gramont]], governor of Navarre, after negotiations to marry her to [[Bauffremont|Louis de Bauffremont]] failed. She separated from her spouse three months after the wedding, and lived therafter in the household of her brother, over whom she was credited some influence in several affairs.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \n\nDue to the position of her brother, she regularly attended court, and became a significant figure in court life. She was known as a distinguished bibliophile, hosted a salon and became a personal friend of [[Madame de Pompadour]].<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \nShe was described as proud, overbearing, and spiteful but also intelligent, witty and attractive, despite not being conventionally beautiful. \n\n===Ambitions===\nUpon the death of Madame de Pompadour in 1764, Gramont had the ambition to succeed her as the official mistress of Louis XV. She shared this ambition with another friend of Pompadour, the Marquise d'Esparbes, and their rivalry attracted attention at court. \n\nGramont's ambition was encouraged by her brother, but reportedly, she attempted to seduce the king in such a direct manner that he became alarmed and avoided her by accepting the advances of her rival instead.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  \n\nAccording to court gossip, Madame d'Esparbes was on the point of being declared official mistress at Marly when Choiseul caused a scene to prevent it. \nMeeting her one day on the grand staircase, he took her by the chin and exclaimed: \"Well, little one, how are your affairs progressing?\", which caused a scandal at court and made Louis XV to discontinue the affair.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>\n\n===The Choiseul party and Madame de Barry===\nGramont continued her attempts to succeed as official royal mistress, and reportedly belived herself to be near success when [[Madame du Barry]] attained the position in 1768. The duchess de Gramont, in collaboration with her sister-in-law the duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau, (referred to as \"the Choiseul-women\") lead the noblewomen first in their efforts to prevent Madame du Barry from being presented at court, and then to ostracize her from it.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  One idea, suggested by the [[Mesdames de France]] was for the king to marry to either the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe]] or [[Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria (1743\u20131808)]], but the Choiseul party opposed a re-marriage of the king, and according to [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau]]: \"Persons in power, imagine that a queen, judicious and amiable, who would succeed in gaining the affection of her husband, might open his eyes to the irregularities and the enormous abuses which exist in all departments here, and cause much embarrassment to those who direct them. They are consequently of opinion that it behoves them to divert the mind of the King from ideas of marriage; and I have very strong proofs that Madame de Gramont, more interested than any one in the mamtenance of the present abuses, has succeeded in persuading M. de Choiseul to renounce his own predilections in this affair.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  \n\nAfter the formal introduction of Madame du Barry to court, Gramont, duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau excused themselwes from the king's private suppers of the Petits Cabinets, effectively demonstrating that it was socially unacceptable for noblewomen to associate with Madame du Barry. The king defeated the boycot by Gramont by enlisting initially the Marechale de Mirepoix (friend of Madame de Pompadour) and then several other noblewomen to intoegrate his mistress at court by acting as her companions.<ref>Joan Haslip (1991). Madame du Barry. The wages of beauty. London: George Wedienfeld and Nicolson Limited. ISBN 0 297 81048 0</ref>  \n\nWhen Madame de Barry was officially accepted at court, the conflict developed into a personal feud between the king's mistress and the Choiseul party. The Duke de Lauzun was sent to mediate a message of peace from Madame du Barry to the Duke de Choiseul, but when he arrived, Choiseul was in the company of his sister and received the message \"with all the haughtiness of a Minister who is harassed by women and believes that he has nothing to fear,\" and declared that \nthere was \"war to the knife\" between him and Madame du Barry, while Gramont \"made some outrageous remarks, in which she did not spare even the King.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  Comtess de Gramont, lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette and the sister-in-law of the Duchess the Gramont, participated in the continuing boycot and made a rude remark to Madame du Barry, causing the king to exile her from court, creating discord between Madame de Barry and Marie Antoinette.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \n\nDuring the affair regarding the Duc d'Aiguillon, she was accused of participating in a conspiracy organised by Choiseul. Mercy reported to empress Maria Theresa that:\"the Duc de Choiseul had had a violent altercation with the Duc de Richelieu, owing to the latter having declared that the Duchesse de Gramont, while passing through Provence and Languedoc, on her way to the waters of Bareges, had sought to stir up the Parliaments of those provinces against the decisions of the Court in the affair of the Duc d'Aiguillon.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \n\nThe conflict between Madame du Barry and the Duke de Choiseul ultimately resulted in the dismissal and exile of Choiseul from court, for which Madame du Barry on one occasion blamed Gramont: \"The conversation after dinner took a more serious turn. She spoke with a charming frankness about the Due de Choiseul, and expressed regret for not having been on friendly terms with him ; she told us of all the trouble she had taken to bring about a better understand- \ning, and said that, had it not been for his sister, the Duchesse de Gramont, she would have succeeded in the end ; she did not complain of any one and said nothing spiteful.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the [[Reign of Terror]], she was arrested and accused of providing funds for the royalist emigrees. Questined before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], which was to condemn her to the guillotine, she was asked: \"Did you not send money to emigrants?\", she replied: \"I was going to say no, but my life is not worth a lie!\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* [[Louis Petit de Bachaumont]], ''Anecdotes piquantes'', Paris, [[Gay et Douc\u00e9]], 1881, p.&nbsp;285.\n* [[Armand Louis de Gontaut-Biron]], ''M\u00e9moires du duc de Lauzun (1747\u20131783)'', Paris, [[Auguste Poulet-Malassis|Poulet-Malassis]] et [[Eug\u00e8ne de Broise|de Broise]], 1858, p.&nbsp;8.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Choiseul-Stainville, B\u00e9atrix de}}\n[[Category:1729 births]]\n[[Category:1794 deaths]]\n[[Category:French bibliophiles]]\n[[Category:People executed by guillotine during the French Revolution]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox noble|type\n| name              = B\u00e9atrix de Choiseul-Stainville\n| title             = Duchess of Gramont\n| image             = Roslin Gramont.jpg\n| caption           = Portrait de la duchesse de Grammont, by Alexander Roslin, c. 1774\n| alt               = \n| CoA               = \n| more              = no\n| succession        = \n| reign             = \n| reign-type        = \n| predecessor       = \n| successor         = \n| suc-type          = \n| spouse            = Antoine VII, Duke of Gramont\n| spouse-type       = \n| issue             = \n| issue-link        = \n| issue-pipe        = \n| full name         = \n| styles            = \n| titles            = \n| noble family      = Duke of Choiseul\n| house-type        = \n| father            = Franz Joseph Marquis de Choiseul\n| mother            = Marie-Louise Bassompierre\n| birth_date        = {{Birth date|1729|11|18|df=y}}\n| birth_place       = Lun\u00e9ville\n| christening_date  = \n| christening_place = \n| death_date        = {{Death date and age|1794|4|17|1729|11|18|df=y}}\n| death_place       = Paris\n| burial_date       = \n| burial_place      = \n| religion          = \n| occupation        = \n| memorials         = \n| website           = <!-- {{{URL|example.com}} -->\n| module            = \n}}\n'''B\u00e9atrix de Choiseul-Stainville, Duchess of Gramont''' (18 November 1729 [[Lun\u00e9ville]] - 17 April 1794 [[Paris]]) was a French salonni\u00e8re and bibliophile.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nB\u00e9atrix was the daughter of [[Franz Joseph Marquis de Choiseul]], Marquis of Stainville, and Marie-Louise Bassompierre, and sister of [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]].

The duchess de Gramont, in collaboration with her sister-in-law the duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau, (referred to as \"the Choiseul-women\") lead the noblewomen first in their efforts to prevent Madame du Barry from being presented at court, and then to ostracize her from it.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  One idea, suggested by the [[Mesdames de France]] was for the king to marry to either the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe]] or [[Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria (1743\u20131808)]], but the Choiseul party opposed a re-marriage of the king, and according to [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau]]: \"Persons in power, imagine that a queen, judicious and amiable, who would succeed in gaining the affection of her husband, might open his eyes to the irregularities and the enormous abuses which exist in all departments here, and cause much embarrassment to those who direct them. They are consequently of opinion that it behoves them to divert the mind of the King from ideas of marriage; and I have very strong proofs that Madame de Gramont, more interested than any one in the mamtenance of the present abuses, has succeeded in persuading M. de Choiseul to renounce his own predilections in this affair.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  \n\nAfter the formal introduction of Madame du Barry to court, Gramont, duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau excused themselwes from the king's private suppers of the Petits Cabinets, effectively demonstrating that it was socially unacceptable for noblewomen to associate with Madame du Barry. The king defeated the boycot by Gramont by enlisting initially the Marechale de Mirepoix (friend of Madame de Pompadour) and then several other noblewomen to intoegrate his mistress at court by acting as her companions.<ref>Joan Haslip (1991). Madame du Barry. The wages of beauty. London: George Wedienfeld and Nicolson Limited. ISBN 0 297 81048 0</ref>  \n\nWhen Madame de Barry was officially accepted at court, the conflict developed into a personal feud between the king's mistress and the Choiseul party. The Duke de Lauzun was sent to mediate a message of peace from Madame du Barry to the Duke de Choiseul, but when he arrived, Choiseul was in the company of his sister and received the message \"with all the haughtiness of a Minister who is harassed by women and believes that he has nothing to fear,\" and declared that \nthere was \"war to the knife\" between him and Madame du Barry, while Gramont \"made some outrageous remarks, in which she did not spare even the King.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>  Comtess de Gramont, lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette and the sister-in-law of the Duchess the Gramont, participated in the continuing boycot and made a rude remark to Madame du Barry, causing the king to exile her from court, creating discord between Madame de Barry and Marie Antoinette.<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \n\nDuring the affair regarding the Duc d'Aiguillon, she was accused of participating in a conspiracy organised by Choiseul. Mercy reported to empress Maria Theresa that:\"the Duc de Choiseul had had a violent altercation with the Duc de Richelieu, owing to the latter having declared that the Duchesse de Gramont, while passing through Provence and Languedoc, on her way to the waters of Bareges, had sought to stir up the Parliaments of those provinces against the decisions of the Court in the affair of the Duc d'Aiguillon.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref> \n\nThe conflict between Madame du Barry and the Duke de Choiseul ultimately resulted in the dismissal and exile of Choiseul from court, for which Madame du Barry on one occasion blamed Gramont: \"The conversation after dinner took a more serious turn. She spoke with a charming frankness about the Due de Choiseul, and expressed regret for not having been on friendly terms with him ; she told us of all the trouble she had taken to bring about a better understand- \ning, and said that, had it not been for his sister, the Duchesse de Gramont, she would have succeeded in the end ; she did not complain of any one and said nothing spiteful.\"<ref>Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905</ref>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the [[Reign of Terror]], she was arrested and accused of providing funds for the royalist emigrees. Questined before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], which was to condemn her to the guillotine, she was asked: \"Did you not send money to emigrants?\", she replied: \"I was going to say no, but my life is not worth a lie!\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* [[Louis Petit de Bachaumont]], ''Anecdotes piquantes'', Paris, [[Gay et Douc\u00e9]], 1881, p.&nbsp;285.\n* [[Armand Louis de Gontaut-Biron]], ''M\u00e9moires du duc de Lauzun (1747\u20131783)'', Paris, [[Auguste Poulet-Malassis|Poulet-Malassis]] et [[Eug\u00e8ne de Broise|de Broise]], 1858, p.&nbsp;8.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Choiseul-Stainville, B\u00e9atrix de}}\n[[Category:1729 births]]\n[[Category:1794 deaths]]\n[[Category:French bibliophiles]]\n[[Category:People executed by guillotine during the French Revolution]]\n", "name_user": "Aciram", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAmbitions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9atrix_de_Choiseul-Stainville"}

I remember as a kid, I went to the [[Colombo]] port and watched the ships coming and going out. I do not know whether it was wanderlust or freedom of movement. I do not know which one it was. Some years ago a friend of mine and I decided that we should have an [[airline]].\" <ref name=DN1/>\n\nHe further stated how his fascination with [[aircraft]] started, \"with hiring [[helicopter]]s from [[Air Force]] to do a film on [[Vietnam]]. I was absolutely fascinated by these helicopters.\" <ref name=DN1/>\n\nIt is this fascination that led not only to the birth of one of the successful domestic airlines, the Lion Air, but also the Asian Aviation Centre (AAC),the premier Aerospace Engineering and Flying Training Academy in Sri Lanka. AAC is one of the few privileged Aerospace Academies in the world with an Airline to have a hands on practice for students.<ref name=DN1/>\n[[File:Asian Aviation Nihara.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Nihara Jayatilleke, Managing Director of the Asian Aviation Centre at her office.]]\nIn the hope of realizing his cherished dream, Rutnam explored the possibility of procuring helicopters with a like minded friend and found out that it was beyond their means.
