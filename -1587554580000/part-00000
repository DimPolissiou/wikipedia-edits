It is home to the [[University of Parma]], one of the oldest universities in the world.\nParma is divided into two parts by the [[Parma (river)|stream of the same name]]. The district on the far side of the river is ''Oltretorrente''. Parma's Etruscan name was adapted by Romans to describe the round shield called ''[[Parma (shield)|Parma]]''.\n\nThe [[Italian literature|Italian]] poet [[Attilio Bertolucci]] (born in a hamlet in the countryside) wrote: \"As a capital city it had to have a river. As a little capital it received a stream, which is often dry\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Parma}}\n{{Quote box |width=17em |align=left   |bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=80% |quote=\n[[File:Consul et lictores.png|15px]] [[Roman Republic]] 183\u201327 BC <br>\n[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|15px]] [[Roman Empire]] 27 BC\u2013285 AD <br>\n[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|15px]] [[Western Roman Empire]] 285\u2013476 <br>\n{{flagicon image|Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg}} [[Odoacer|Kingdom of Odoacer]] 476\u2013493 <br>\n{{flagicon image|Teodorico re dei Goti (493-526).png}} [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] 493\u2013553 <br>\n[[File:Simple Labarum.svg|12px]] [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] 553-568 <br>\n[[File:Corona ferrea monza (heraldry).svg|15px]] [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] 568\u2013773 <br>\n[[File:Charlemagne autograph.svg|15px]] [[Carolingian Empire]] 773\u2013781 <br>\n[[File:Corona ferrea monza (heraldry).svg|15px]] [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Regnum Italiae]] 781\u20131014 <br>\n[[File:Shield and Coat of Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (c.1200-c.1300).svg|15px]] [[Holy Roman Empire]] 1014\u20131114 <br>\n[[File:Parma-Stemma.png|15px]] [[Medieval Commune|Free Commune]] 1114\u20131341 <br>\n[[File:Flag of the Duchy of Milan.png|15px|border]] [[Duchy of Milan]] 1341\u20131513 <br>\n[[File:Flag of the Papal States (pre 1808).svg|15px|border]] [[Papal States]] 1513\u20131554 <br>\n[[File:Flag of the Duchy of Parma.svg|15px|border]] [[Duchy of Parma]] 1554\u20131808 <br>\n[[File:Flag of France.svg|15px|border]] [[First French Empire]] 1808\u20131814 <br>\n[[File:Bandiera del ducato di Parma, Piacenza e Guastalla.png|15px|border]] [[Duchy of Parma|Duchy of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla]] 1814\u20131848 <br>\n[[File:Flag of the Duchy of Parma (1851-1859).svg|15px|border]] [[Duchy of Parma]] 1851\u20131859 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy.svg|15px|border]] [[United Provinces of Central Italy]] 1859\u20131860 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy (1861-1946).svg|15px|border]] [[Kingdom of Italy]] 1861\u20131946 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy.svg|15px|border]] [[Italian Republic]] 1946\u2013present\n}}\n\n===Prehistory===\nParma was already a built-up area in the [[Bronze Age]]. In the current position of the city rose a [[Terramare culture|terramare]].<ref>[http://www.emiliaromagnaturismo.it/it/archeologia/terramare.html Archaeology in Emilia Romagna page.]</ref> The \"terramare\" (marl earth) were ancient villages built of wood on piles according to a defined scheme and squared form; constructed on dry land and generally in proximity to the rivers. During this age (between 1500 BC and 800 BC) the first [[necropolis]] (on the sites of the present-day Piazza Duomo and Piazzale della Macina) were constructed.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nThe city was most probably founded and named by the [[Etruscans]], for a ''parma'' or ''palma'' (circular shield) was a [[Latin language|Latin]] borrowing, as were many Roman terms for particular arms, and the names ''Parmeal'', ''Parmni'' and ''Parmnial'' appear in Etruscan inscriptions. [[Diodorus Siculus]]<ref>XXII, 2,2; XXVIII, 2,1</ref> reported that the Romans had changed their rectangular shields for round ones, imitating the Etruscans. Whether the Etruscan encampment acquired its name from its round shape, like a shield, or from its metaphorical function as a shield against the Gauls to the north, remains uncertain.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony was founded in 183 BC, together with Mutina ([[Modena]]); 2,000 families were settled. Parma had a certain importance as a road hub over the [[Via Aemilia]] and the Via Claudia. It had a forum, in what is today the central Garibaldi Square. In 44 BC the city was destroyed; subsequently [[Augustus]] rebuilt it. During the [[Roman Empire]], it gained the title of ''Julia'' for its loyalty to the imperial house.\n\n[[Attila]] sacked the city in 452,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Domenico\n| first1 = Roy Palmer\n| chapter = Parma\n| title = The Regions of Italy: A Reference Guide to History and Culture\n| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ-PMNC5XOkC\n| location = Westport, Connecticur\n| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group\n| publication-date = 2002\n| page = 93\n| isbn = 9780313307331\n| access-date = 2019-05-05\n| quote = Atila the Hun put Parma to the torch in 452, as did Totila the Ostrogoth in the mid-500s. It was rebuilt a number of times as a Lombard capital, the site of a Byzantine treasury, and, from the ninth century, a bishopric.\n}}\n</ref>\nand the Germanic king [[Odoacer]] later gifted it to his followers. During the [[Gothic War (535\u2013552) |Gothic War]], however, [[Totila]] destroyed it. It was then part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] (changing its name to ''Chrysopolis'', \"Golden City\", probably due to the presence of the imperial treasury) and, from 569, of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] Kingdom of Italy. During the Middle Ages, Parma became an important stage of the [[Via Francigena]], the main road connecting Rome to Northern Europe; several castles, hospitals and inns were built in the following centuries to host the increasing number of pilgrims who passed by Parma and Fidenza, following the Apennines via Collecchio, Berceto and the Corchia ranges before descending the Passo della Cisa into Tuscany, heading finally south toward Rome.\n\nThe city had a medieval Jewish community.<ref>\n[https://www.jpost.com/Travel/Jerusalem/Italys-poetic-Parma-region Italy's poetic Parma region] - \"Italy has one of the oldest European Diaspora communities and a Jewish presence has been documented in Rome for more than 2,200 years. However, Jews only arrived in the Emilia-Romagna region during the 13th century.\"\n</ref>\nThe [[Biblioteca Palatina, Parma | Palatine Library]] houses the largest collection of Hebrew manuscripts in Italy, and the second-largest in the world after the Bodleian Library in Oxford<ref>\n[https://jguideeurope.org/en/region/italy/emilia-romagna/parma/ Parma] - \"The Palatine Library is as well home to the largest Italian collection of Hebrew manuscripts, and the second largest in the world after the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The documents were a gift of Maria Luigia Duchess.\"\n</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Battistero.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baptistery of Parma]], 1196-1270]]\n\nUnder [[Franks|Frankish]] rule, Parma became the capital of a county (774). Like most northern Italian cities, it was nominally a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] created by [[Charlemagne]], but locally ruled by its bishops, the first being Guibodus. In the subsequent struggles between the [[Papal States|Papacy]] and the Empire, Parma was usually a member of the Imperial party. Two of its bishops became [[antipope]]s: C\u00e0dalo, founder of the cathedral, as [[Antipope Honorius II|Honorius II]]; and Guibert, as [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]]. An almost independent [[medieval commune|commune]] was created around 1140; a treaty between Parma and [[Piacenza]] of 1149 is the earliest document of a ''comune'' headed by [[consul]]s.<ref>G. Drei, ''Le Carte degli archivi parmensi del secolo XII'' (Parma, 1950) doc. no. 194; the genesis of the Parmesan commune is studied by R. Schumann, \"Authority and the commune: Parma, 833\u20131033\", (Parma: Deputazione di storia patria, series 2.2, VIII) 1973.</ref> After the [[Peace of Constance]] (1183) confirmed the Italian communes' rights of self-governance, long-standing quarrels with the neighbouring communes of [[Reggio Emilia]], Piacenza and [[Cremona]] became harsher, with the aim of controlling the vital trading line over the [[Po River]].\n\nThe struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] was a feature of Parma too. In 1213, her ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' was the Guelph [[Rambertino Buvalelli]]. Then, after a long stance alongside the emperors, the Papist families of the city gained control in 1248. The city was besieged in 1247\u201348 by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who was however crushed in the [[Battle of Parma|battle]] that ensued.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Parma nel XV secolo.jpg|thumb|Parma in the 15th century]]\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nParma fell under the control of [[Milan]] in 1341. After a short-lived period of independence under the Terzi family (1404\u20131409), the [[Sforza]] imposed their rule (1440\u20131449) through their associated families of [[Pallavicino]], Rossi, Sanvitale and Da Correggio. These created a kind of new [[feudalism]], building towers and castles throughout the city and the land. These fiefs evolved into truly independent states: the Landi governed the higher [[Taro (river)|Taro]]'s valley from 1257 to 1682. The Pallavicino seignory extended over the eastern part of today's province, with the capital in [[Busseto]]. Parma's territories were an exception for Northern Italy, as its feudal subdivision frequently continued until more recent years. For example, Solignano was a Pallavicino family possession until 1805, and [[San Secondo Parmense|San Secondo]] belonged to the Rossi well into the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Parma, palazzo della pilotta 01.jpg|right|thumb|View of [[Palazzo della Pilotta]] in the Piazza della Pace. The rebuilt part on the right is where once was the church of St.Peter. The large hole was caused by an Allies bombing.]]\nBetween the 14th and the 15th centuries, Parma was at the centre of the Italian Wars. The [[Battle of Fornovo]] was fought in its territory. The [[France|French]] held the city in 1500\u20131521, with a short Papal parenthesis in 1512\u20131515. After the foreigners were expelled, Parma belonged to the [[Papal States]] until 1545.\n\nIn that year the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], detached Parma and [[Piacenza]] from the Papal States and gave them as a duchy to his illegitimate son, [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi Farnese]], whose descendants ruled in Parma until 1731, when [[Antonio Farnese]], last male of the Farnese line, died. In 1594 a constitution was promulgated, the [[University of Parma|University]] enhanced and the Nobles' College founded. The war to reduce the barons' power continued for several years: in 1612 Barbara Sanseverino was executed in the central square of Parma, together with six other nobles charged of plotting against the duke. At the end of the 17th century, after the defeat of Pallavicini (1588) and Landi (1682) the Farnese duke could finally hold with firm hand all Parmense territories. The castle of the Sanseverino in [[Colorno]] was turned into a luxurious summer palace by [[Ferdinando Galli Bibiena|Ferdinando Bibiena]].\n\nIn the Treaty of London (1718) it was promulgated that the heir to the combined [[Duchy of Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] would be [[Elisabeth Farnese]]'s elder son with [[Philip V of Spain]], [[Charles III of Spain|Don Carlos]]. In 1731, the fifteen-year-old Don Carlos became Charles I Duke of Parma and Piacenza, at the death of his childless great uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1734, Charles I conquered the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, and was crowned as the King of Naples and Sicily on 3 July 1735, leaving the Duchy of Parma to his brother [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Philip (Filippo I di Borbone-Parma)]]. All the outstanding art collections of the duke's palaces of Parma, [[Colorno]] and [[Sala Baganza]] were moved to [[Naples]].\n\nParma was under French influence after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aachen]] (1748). Parma became a modern state with the energetic action of prime minister [[Guillaume du Tillot]]. He created the bases for a modern industry and fought strenuously against the church's privileges. The city lived a period of particular splendour: the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] (Palatine Library), the Archaeological Museum, the Picture Gallery and the Botanical Garden were founded, together with the Royal Printing Works directed by [[Giambattista Bodoni]], aided by the [[Amoretti Brothers]] as skilled and inspired punchcutters.\n\n===Contemporary age===\n[[File:Parma 1832.jpg|thumb|Parma in 1832]]\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1802\u20131814), Parma was annexed to [[France]] and made capital of the [[Taro (d\u00e9partement)|Taro Department]]. Under its French name '''Parme''', it was also created a ''[[duch\u00e9 grand-fief de l'Empire]]'' for [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]], the Emperor's Arch-Treasurer, on 24 April 1808 (extinguished 1926).\n\nAfter the restoration of the Duchy of Parma by the 1814\u201315 [[Vienna Congress]], the [[Risorgimento]]'s upheavals had no fertile ground in the tranquil duchy. In 1847, after [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]]'s death, it passed again to the [[House of Bourbon]], the last of whom was stabbed in the city and left it to his widow, Luisa Maria of Berry. On 15 September 1859 the dynasty was declared deposed, and Parma entered the newly formed province of Emilia under [[Luigi Carlo Farini]]. With the [[plebiscite]] of 1860 the former duchy became part of the unified [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nThe loss of the capital role provoked an economic and social crisis in Parma. It started to recover its role of industrial prominence after the railway connection with [[Piacenza]] and [[Bologna]] of 1859, and with [[Fornovo di Taro|Fornovo]] and [[Suzzara]] in 1883. [[Trade union]]s were strong in the city, in which a famous General Strike was declared from 1 May to 6 June 1908. The struggle with [[Fascism]] had its most dramatic moment in the August 1922, when the regime officer [[Italo Balbo]] attempted to enter the popular quarter of Oltretorrente. The citizens organized into the ''Arditi del Popolo'' (\"People's champions\") and pushed back the [[squadristi]]. This episode is considered the first example of Resistance in Italy.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Parma was a strong centre of [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance. The train station and marshalling yards were targets for high altitude bombing by the Allies in the spring of 1944. Much of the [[Palazzo della Pilotta]] \u2014 situated not far (half a mile) from the train station \u2014 was destroyed. Along with it also [[Teatro Farnese]] and part of Biblioteca Palatina were destroyed by Allied bombs. Several other monuments were also damaged: Palazzo del Giardino, Steccata and San Giovanni churches, Palazzo Ducale, Paganini theater and the monument to [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. However Parma did not see widespread destruction during the war. Parma was liberated from the German occupation (1943\u20131945) on 26 April 1945 by the partisan resistance and the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Brazilian Expeditionary Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitoresco.com/historia/guerra/guerra01.htm |title=Mapa da \u0440rea de opera\u0443\u0448es |publisher=Pitoresco.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIn Parma, the average annual high temperature is {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0}}, the annual low temperature is {{convert|9|\u00b0C|0}}, and the annual precipitation is {{convert|777|mm|2|abbr=off}}.\n\nThe following data comes from the weather station located at the University in the city center.

In the current position of the city rose a [[Terramare culture|terramare]].<ref>[http://www.emiliaromagnaturismo.it/it/archeologia/terramare.html Archaeology in Emilia Romagna page.]</ref> The \"terramare\" (marl earth) were ancient villages built of wood on piles according to a defined scheme and squared form; constructed on dry land and generally in proximity to the rivers. During this age (between 1500 BC and 800 BC) the first [[necropolis]] (on the sites of the present-day Piazza Duomo and Piazzale della Macina) were constructed.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nThe city was most probably founded and named by the [[Etruscans]], for a ''parma'' or ''palma'' (circular shield) was a [[Latin language|Latin]] borrowing, as were many Roman terms for particular arms, and the names ''Parmeal'', ''Parmni'' and ''Parmnial'' appear in Etruscan inscriptions. [[Diodorus Siculus]]<ref>XXII, 2,2; XXVIII, 2,1</ref> reported that the Romans had changed their rectangular shields for round ones, imitating the Etruscans. Whether the Etruscan encampment acquired its name from its round shape, like a shield, or from its metaphorical function as a shield against the Gauls to the north, remains uncertain.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony was founded in 183 BC, together with Mutina ([[Modena]]); 2,000 families were settled. Parma had a certain importance as a road hub over the [[Via Aemilia]] and the Via Claudia. It had a forum, in what is today the central Garibaldi Square. In 44 BC the city was destroyed; subsequently [[Augustus]] rebuilt it. During the [[Roman Empire]], it gained the title of ''Julia'' for its loyalty to the imperial house.\n\n[[Attila]] sacked the city in 452,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Domenico\n| first1 = Roy Palmer\n| chapter = Parma\n| title = The Regions of Italy: A Reference Guide to History and Culture\n| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ-PMNC5XOkC\n| location = Westport, Connecticur\n| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group\n| publication-date = 2002\n| page = 93\n| isbn = 9780313307331\n| access-date = 2019-05-05\n| quote = Atila the Hun put Parma to the torch in 452, as did Totila the Ostrogoth in the mid-500s.

During the [[Gothic War (535\u2013552) |Gothic War]], however, [[Totila]] destroyed it. It was then part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] (changing its name to ''Chrysopolis'', \"Golden City\", probably due to the presence of the imperial treasury) and, from 569, of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] Kingdom of Italy. During the Middle Ages, Parma became an important stage of the [[Via Francigena]], the main road connecting Rome to Northern Europe; several castles, hospitals and inns were built in the following centuries to host the increasing number of pilgrims who passed by Parma and Fidenza, following the Apennines via Collecchio, Berceto and the Corchia ranges before descending the Passo della Cisa into Tuscany, heading finally south toward Rome.\n\nThe city had a medieval Jewish community.<ref>\n[https://www.jpost.com/Travel/Jerusalem/Italys-poetic-Parma-region Italy's poetic Parma region] - \"Italy has one of the oldest European Diaspora communities and a Jewish presence has been documented in Rome for more than 2,200 years.

Like most northern Italian cities, it was nominally a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] created by [[Charlemagne]], but locally ruled by its bishops, the first being Guibodus. In the subsequent struggles between the [[Papal States|Papacy]] and the Empire, Parma was usually a member of the Imperial party. Two of its bishops became [[antipope]]s: C\u00e0dalo, founder of the cathedral, as [[Antipope Honorius II|Honorius II]]; and Guibert, as [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]]. An almost independent [[medieval commune|commune]] was created around 1140; a treaty between Parma and [[Piacenza]] of 1149 is the earliest document of a ''comune'' headed by [[consul]]s.<ref>G.

Schumann, \"Authority and the commune: Parma, 833\u20131033\", (Parma: Deputazione di storia patria, series 2.2, VIII) 1973.</ref> After the [[Peace of Constance]] (1183) confirmed the Italian communes' rights of self-governance, long-standing quarrels with the neighbouring communes of [[Reggio Emilia]], Piacenza and [[Cremona]] became harsher, with the aim of controlling the vital trading line over the [[Po River]].\n\nThe struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] was a feature of Parma too. In 1213, her ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' was the Guelph [[Rambertino Buvalelli]]. Then, after a long stance alongside the emperors, the Papist families of the city gained control in 1248. The city was besieged in 1247\u201348 by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who was however crushed in the [[Battle of Parma|battle]] that ensued.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Parma nel XV secolo.jpg|thumb|Parma in the 15th century]]\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nParma fell under the control of [[Milan]] in 1341. After a short-lived period of independence under the Terzi family (1404\u20131409), the [[Sforza]] imposed their rule (1440\u20131449) through their associated families of [[Pallavicino]], Rossi, Sanvitale and Da Correggio. These created a kind of new [[feudalism]], building towers and castles throughout the city and the land. These fiefs evolved into truly independent states: the Landi governed the higher [[Taro (river)|Taro]]'s valley from 1257 to 1682. The Pallavicino seignory extended over the eastern part of today's province, with the capital in [[Busseto]]. Parma's territories were an exception for Northern Italy, as its feudal subdivision frequently continued until more recent years. For example, Solignano was a Pallavicino family possession until 1805, and [[San Secondo Parmense|San Secondo]] belonged to the Rossi well into the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Parma, palazzo della pilotta 01.jpg|right|thumb|View of [[Palazzo della Pilotta]] in the Piazza della Pace. The rebuilt part on the right is where once was the church of St.Peter. The large hole was caused by an Allies bombing.]]\nBetween the 14th and the 15th centuries, Parma was at the centre of the Italian Wars. The [[Battle of Fornovo]] was fought in its territory. The [[France|French]] held the city in 1500\u20131521, with a short Papal parenthesis in 1512\u20131515. After the foreigners were expelled, Parma belonged to the [[Papal States]] until 1545.\n\nIn that year the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], detached Parma and [[Piacenza]] from the Papal States and gave them as a duchy to his illegitimate son, [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi Farnese]], whose descendants ruled in Parma until 1731, when [[Antonio Farnese]], last male of the Farnese line, died. In 1594 a constitution was promulgated, the [[University of Parma|University]] enhanced and the Nobles' College founded. The war to reduce the barons' power continued for several years: in 1612 Barbara Sanseverino was executed in the central square of Parma, together with six other nobles charged of plotting against the duke. At the end of the 17th century, after the defeat of Pallavicini (1588) and Landi (1682) the Farnese duke could finally hold with firm hand all Parmense territories. The castle of the Sanseverino in [[Colorno]] was turned into a luxurious summer palace by [[Ferdinando Galli Bibiena|Ferdinando Bibiena]].\n\nIn the Treaty of London (1718) it was promulgated that the heir to the combined [[Duchy of Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] would be [[Elisabeth Farnese]]'s elder son with [[Philip V of Spain]], [[Charles III of Spain|Don Carlos]]. In 1731, the fifteen-year-old Don Carlos became Charles I Duke of Parma and Piacenza, at the death of his childless great uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1734, Charles I conquered the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, and was crowned as the King of Naples and Sicily on 3 July 1735, leaving the Duchy of Parma to his brother [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Philip (Filippo I di Borbone-Parma)]]. All the outstanding art collections of the duke's palaces of Parma, [[Colorno]] and [[Sala Baganza]] were moved to [[Naples]].\n\nParma was under French influence after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aachen]] (1748). Parma became a modern state with the energetic action of prime minister [[Guillaume du Tillot]]. He created the bases for a modern industry and fought strenuously against the church's privileges. The city lived a period of particular splendour: the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] (Palatine Library), the Archaeological Museum, the Picture Gallery and the Botanical Garden were founded, together with the Royal Printing Works directed by [[Giambattista Bodoni]], aided by the [[Amoretti Brothers]] as skilled and inspired punchcutters.\n\n===Contemporary age===\n[[File:Parma 1832.jpg|thumb|Parma in 1832]]\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1802\u20131814), Parma was annexed to [[France]] and made capital of the [[Taro (d\u00e9partement)|Taro Department]]. Under its French name '''Parme''', it was also created a ''[[duch\u00e9 grand-fief de l'Empire]]'' for [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]], the Emperor's Arch-Treasurer, on 24 April 1808 (extinguished 1926).\n\nAfter the restoration of the Duchy of Parma by the 1814\u201315 [[Vienna Congress]], the [[Risorgimento]]'s upheavals had no fertile ground in the tranquil duchy. In 1847, after [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]]'s death, it passed again to the [[House of Bourbon]], the last of whom was stabbed in the city and left it to his widow, Luisa Maria of Berry. On 15 September 1859 the dynasty was declared deposed, and Parma entered the newly formed province of Emilia under [[Luigi Carlo Farini]]. With the [[plebiscite]] of 1860 the former duchy became part of the unified [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nThe loss of the capital role provoked an economic and social crisis in Parma. It started to recover its role of industrial prominence after the railway connection with [[Piacenza]] and [[Bologna]] of 1859, and with [[Fornovo di Taro|Fornovo]] and [[Suzzara]] in 1883. [[Trade union]]s were strong in the city, in which a famous General Strike was declared from 1 May to 6 June 1908. The struggle with [[Fascism]] had its most dramatic moment in the August 1922, when the regime officer [[Italo Balbo]] attempted to enter the popular quarter of Oltretorrente. The citizens organized into the ''Arditi del Popolo'' (\"People's champions\") and pushed back the [[squadristi]]. This episode is considered the first example of Resistance in Italy.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Parma was a strong centre of [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance. The train station and marshalling yards were targets for high altitude bombing by the Allies in the spring of 1944. Much of the [[Palazzo della Pilotta]] \u2014 situated not far (half a mile) from the train station \u2014 was destroyed. Along with it also [[Teatro Farnese]] and part of Biblioteca Palatina were destroyed by Allied bombs. Several other monuments were also damaged: Palazzo del Giardino, Steccata and San Giovanni churches, Palazzo Ducale, Paganini theater and the monument to [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. However Parma did not see widespread destruction during the war. Parma was liberated from the German occupation (1943\u20131945) on 26 April 1945 by the partisan resistance and the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Brazilian Expeditionary Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitoresco.com/historia/guerra/guerra01.htm |title=Mapa da \u0440rea de opera\u0443\u0448es |publisher=Pitoresco.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIn Parma, the average annual high temperature is {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0}}, the annual low temperature is {{convert|9|\u00b0C|0}}, and the annual precipitation is {{convert|777|mm|2|abbr=off}}.\n\nThe following data comes from the weather station located at the University in the city center.

It is the largest arts festival on the African continent<ref>{{cite web|title=Grahamstown Festival \u2013 MSN Encarta <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE -->|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781561394/grahamstown_festival.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824050000/http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781561394/Grahamstown_Festival.html|archivedate=24 August 2005|url-status=dead|access-date=26 September 2009}}</ref> and one of the largest performing arts festivals in the world by visitor numbers.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Fringe Alliance|url=http://www.worldfringealliance.com/|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe festival runs for 11 days, from the last week of June to the first week of July every year. It takes place in the small [[Rhodes University|university]] city of Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown),<ref name=\"maha_Grah\">{{Cite web\n| title = A Festival of Resistance\n| author = Ben Fogel\n| work = Mahala\n| date = 13 July 2012\n| accessdate = 6 September 2014\n| url = http://www.mahala.co.za/art/a-festival-of-resistance/\n| quote =\n}}</ref> in the [[Eastern Cape]] province of South Africa.\n\nThe NAF comprises a Main programme and a Fringe festival, both administered by the National Arts Festival Office, a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] Section 21 Company. The Festival programme includes [[performing arts]] (theatre, dance, stand-up comedy and live music), visual art exhibitions, films, talks and workshops, a large food and craft fair and historical tours of the city. The NAF runs a children's arts festival over the same period and a number of other festivals take place in Grahamstown over the period of the NAF, such as the [[National Youth Jazz Festival]].\n\nPerformances take place across the city in approximately 60 venues (such as theatres, churches, schools) as well as in various outdoor locations for the street performances.\n\nThe Festival attracts significant numbers of local and international visitors and is one of the biggest contributors to the economy of the region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Antrobus|first1=Geoff|title=National Arts Festival Drives the Economy of Grahamstown|url=https://www.mediaupdate.co.za/media/59162/the-national-arts-festival-drives-the-economy-of-grahamstown-eastern-cape|website=Media Update|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nMakhanda has been associated with carnivals and festivals for more than 180 years as British immigrants established the tradition of celebrating landmark anniversaries on a grand scale. When a movement gained ground last century to erect a memorial to these pioneers it was agreed that it should be a \"living\" monument presenting festivals, conferences and other gatherings.\n\nAn Inaugural Festival was held in 1974 when the [[1820 Settlers National Monument]] was officially opened, with the exception of 1975, a festival has been organised every year since then.\n\n== The main programme ==\n\nA committee of curators in the various disciplines selects the content of the main programme. The planning process takes into account what is available locally and from outside South Africa. Three considerations that influence decisions are the artistic merits of any submission, the creation of a varied and balanced programme, and the costs involved. The Committee strives for excellence in all aspects of the programme, an approach that has assisted in bringing in sponsorship money for world class shows from a number of foreign governments and large multinational corporations.\n\n== The fringe ==\n\nToday, the Fringe is on an equal footing with the Main Festival. Seasoned performers and famous directors can just as easily be found on either programme, and a slot on the main programme one year does not preclude a return to the Fringe the next. The distinguishing feature of the Fringe is that it is open to all and exempt from the selection process that applies to the main programme. Fringe participants are responsible for their own costs and 85% of their box office sales accrue to them directly. They are liable for certain payments for venue hire and registration fees.\n\n=== Subsidiary festivals ===\n\nA number of subsidiary festivals take place as part of the National Arts Festival:\n* Think Fest<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thinkfest.wordpress.com/|title=Think!Fest|website=Think!Fest|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n* Spiritfest<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamstowncathedral.org/spiritfest/|title=Spiritfest \u2013 Cathedral of St Michael and St George|website=www.grahamstowncathedral.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n* Wordfest<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ru.ac.za/wordfest/ |title = Rhodes University-Where Leaders Learn}}</ref>\n* [[National Youth Jazz Festival]]\n* [[Fingo Festival]]\n* Creativate Digital Arts Festival\n* National Schools Festival\n\n== Young Artist Awards ==\n\nThe Young Artist Awards, sponsored by Standard Bank, are presented by the National Arts Festival Artistic Committee to emerging, relatively young South African artists who have demonstrated exceptional ability in their chosen fields but who have not yet achieved national exposure and acclaim.\n\nFestival Committee members, fellow artists and interested members of the public, nominate artists. The NAF Committee, a group of experts in the various arts disciplines, decides on the final recipients.\n\nDesigned to encourage the recipients in the pursuit of their careers, a key aspect of the awards is that they guarantee the artists a place on the main programme of the forthcoming National Arts Festival. Apart from a cash prize, each of the winners receive substantial financial backing for their Festival participation whether this involves the mounting of an exhibition or the staging of a production.\n\nA maximum of five awards are made annually in any one of the disciplines of drama, music, jazz, visual art, dance and film. Since the inception of the awards in 1981 more than 150 awards have been presented plus five special awards to artists in recognition of their contribution to the National Arts Festival and the arts of South Africa.

Festival launched a new set of awards for Fringe productions \u2013 the Standard Bank Ovation Awards. These awards recognise excellence on the Fringe, and aim to seek out those productions that are innovative, original and creatively outstanding. At the end of the Festival, Gold and Silver awards are selected from the list of winners, rewarding the best productions in the categories theatre, dance, comedy, music.\n\nRecipients of the Standard Bank Ovation Awards benefit from the recognition provided by the acknowledgement, with companies or artists often being offered extended tours, international opportunities to perform, increased opportunities for funding, and an invitation to submit a proposal for the following year's Arena programme. Artists who win Gold and Silver awards receive modest monetary incentives.\n\n<ref name=\"artl_Arts\">{{Cite press release\n| title = 2017 National Arts Festival Honours Winners of Standard Bank Ovation Awards\n| author = BWW News Desk\n| via= BroadwayWorld\n| date = 11 July 2017\n| accessdate = 15 November 2017\n| url = https://www.broadwayworld.com/south-africa/article/2017-National-Arts-Festival-Honours-Winners-of-Standard-Bank-Ovation-Awards-20170711\n| language =\n| quote =\n}}</ref>\n\n== Featured Artists ==\n\nSince the Featured Artist Programme was launched in 2012, the National Arts Festival has celebrated and showcased established artists who have built up a substantial body of work that has contributed to South Africa\u2019s national discourse on race, class or gender in a significant way.\n\nRecipients of this award are:\n* 2020: [[Madosini]], traditional musician <ref>https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2020-03-03-national-arts-festival-names-madosini-as-featured-artist/</ref>\n* 2019: Bernie Searle, visual artist\n* 2018: Mamela Nyamza, dancer and choreographer <ref>\"Mamela Nyanza First Choreographer To Be Named NAF Featured Artist\", http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/01/10/mamela-nyanza-first-choreographer-to-be-named-naf-featured-artist_a_23329703/</ref>\n* 2017: Neo Muyanga, musician and composer\n* 2016: Lara Foot, playwright and director\n* 2015: [[Satire]] (The genre was chosen as the programme centrepiece)\n* 2014: [[Sylvaine Strike]], actor and director\n* 2013: Mike van Graan, playwright and director\n\n== Growth and development ==\n\nThe NAF has grown since its inception. In 1974 there were 64 events on the main programme. (Events refer to productions, exhibitions, workshops, lectures, tours and so forth. A drama or dance production is counted as a single event irrespective of how many times it may be performed.) The Fringe started in 1979 with 10 events. As of 2010 the National Arts Festival comprises more than 350 events with over 1,200 performances.<ref name=\"groc_Nati\">{{Cite press release\n| title = National Arts Festival reports attendance of almost 186 000\n| author =\n| via= [[Grocott's Mail]]\n| date = 6 July 2010\n| accessdate = 6 September 2014\n| url = http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/national-arts-festival-reports-attendance-almost-186-000-06-07-2010\n| quote =\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Village Green craft fair was introduced in 1989 with approximately 90 stalls. Now it attracts close to 1,000 stallholders. The fair offers visitors the chance to buy an array of goods, from pure wool sweaters to handcrafted beadwork, and there are stalls offering a various exotic foods. In addition, there are Craft Villages at Fiddlers Green and on [[Grahamstown Cathedral|Church Square]].\n\n== Social responsibility ==\n\nThe National Arts Festival claims to be a socially responsible festival, this however, has been contested.<ref>[http://www.mahala.co.za/art/a-festival-of-resistance/ A Festival of Resistance], ''Mahala'', Ben Fogel 13 July 2012</ref>\n\nThe Hands On!

The scholars attended workshops, seminars, performances and visits to galleries while being mentored in arts practice and arts appreciation.\n\nThe Art Factory teaches local marginalised and vulnerable youth performance skills such as juggling and acrobatics and combines this with a strategic focus on building the life skills and confidence of the youth. The Art Factory functions as a year-round project in Grahamstown.\n\nAs part of the ArtsReach Programme the National Arts Festival takes the arts to hospitals, clinics, old age homes and rural areas. A number of artists on the Fringe volunteer their performances for the ArtsReach programme during the NAF.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Arts Encounter Project distributes a number of tickets to indigent individuals to enable them to enjoy productions from the NAF's main and fringe programmes.\n\n== Publications ==\n\nThe National Arts Festival publishes a printed booking kit or programme every year, which includes artistic and schedule information about the shows as well as tips on how to book tickets, getting to Grahamstown and where to stay. A full PDF of the programme is available online via the NAF's website at www.nationalartsfestival.co.za.\n\n== Bookings ==\n\nA computerised booking system was introduced in 1989. In 1997, for the first time in the history of South African theatre, the National Arts Festival introduced internet bookings. The NAF website, which was launched in 1994, acts as an online registration vehicle for artists in the build-up to the Festival, and as a ticket booking hub for the Festival. A free-to-download mobile app has also been developed, which allows visitors to browse shows and book tickets.\n\n== Staff ==\n\nThe National Arts Festival has a small permanent staff comprising around 10 full-time staff members.

The Festival programme includes [[performing arts]] (theatre, dance, stand-up comedy and live music), visual art exhibitions, films, talks and workshops, a large food and craft fair and historical tours of the city. The NAF runs a children's arts festival over the same period and a number of other festivals take place in Grahamstown over the period of the NAF, such as the [[National Youth Jazz Festival]].\n\nPerformances take place across the city in approximately 60 venues (such as theatres, churches, schools) as well as in various outdoor locations for the street performances.\n\nThe Festival attracts significant numbers of local and international visitors and is one of the biggest contributors to the economy of the region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Antrobus|first1=Geoff|title=National Arts Festival Drives the Economy of Grahamstown|url=https://www.mediaupdate.co.za/media/59162/the-national-arts-festival-drives-the-economy-of-grahamstown-eastern-cape|website=Media Update|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nMakhanda has been associated with carnivals and festivals for more than 180 years as British immigrants established the tradition of celebrating landmark anniversaries on a grand scale. When a movement gained ground last century to erect a memorial to these pioneers it was agreed that it should be a \"living\" monument presenting festivals, conferences and other gatherings.\n\nAn Inaugural Festival was held in 1974 when the [[1820 Settlers National Monument]] was officially opened, with the exception of 1975, a festival has been organised every year since then.\n\n== The main programme ==\n\nA committee of curators in the various disciplines selects the content of the main programme. The planning process takes into account what is available locally and from outside South Africa. Three considerations that influence decisions are the artistic merits of any submission, the creation of a varied and balanced programme, and the costs involved. The Committee strives for excellence in all aspects of the programme, an approach that has assisted in bringing in sponsorship money for world class shows from a number of foreign governments and large multinational corporations.\n\n== The fringe ==\n\nToday, the Fringe is on an equal footing with the Main Festival. Seasoned performers and famous directors can just as easily be found on either programme, and a slot on the main programme one year does not preclude a return to the Fringe the next. The distinguishing feature of the Fringe is that it is open to all and exempt from the selection process that applies to the main programme. Fringe participants are responsible for their own costs and 85% of their box office sales accrue to them directly. They are liable for certain payments for venue hire and registration fees.\n\n=== Subsidiary festivals ===\n\nA number of subsidiary festivals take place as part of the National Arts Festival:\n* Think Fest<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thinkfest.wordpress.com/|title=Think!Fest|website=Think!Fest|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n* Spiritfest<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamstowncathedral.org/spiritfest/|title=Spiritfest \u2013 Cathedral of St Michael and St George|website=www.grahamstowncathedral.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n* Wordfest<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ru.ac.za/wordfest/ |title = Rhodes University-Where Leaders Learn}}</ref>\n* [[National Youth Jazz Festival]]\n* [[Fingo Festival]]\n* Creativate Digital Arts Festival\n* National Schools Festival\n\n== Young Artist Awards ==\n\nThe Young Artist Awards, sponsored by Standard Bank, are presented by the National Arts Festival Artistic Committee to emerging, relatively young South African artists who have demonstrated exceptional ability in their chosen fields but who have not yet achieved national exposure and acclaim.\n\nFestival Committee members, fellow artists and interested members of the public, nominate artists. The NAF Committee, a group of experts in the various arts disciplines, decides on the final recipients.\n\nDesigned to encourage the recipients in the pursuit of their careers, a key aspect of the awards is that they guarantee the artists a place on the main programme of the forthcoming National Arts Festival. Apart from a cash prize, each of the winners receive substantial financial backing for their Festival participation whether this involves the mounting of an exhibition or the staging of a production.\n\nA maximum of five awards are made annually in any one of the disciplines of drama, music, jazz, visual art, dance and film. Since the inception of the awards in 1981 more than 150 awards have been presented plus five special awards to artists in recognition of their contribution to the National Arts Festival and the arts of South Africa.

Festival launched a new set of awards for Fringe productions \u2013 the Standard Bank Ovation Awards. These awards recognise excellence on the Fringe, and aim to seek out those productions that are innovative, original and creatively outstanding. At the end of the Festival, Gold and Silver awards are selected from the list of winners, rewarding the best productions in the categories theatre, dance, comedy, music.\n\nRecipients of the Standard Bank Ovation Awards benefit from the recognition provided by the acknowledgement, with companies or artists often being offered extended tours, international opportunities to perform, increased opportunities for funding, and an invitation to submit a proposal for the following year's Arena programme. Artists who win Gold and Silver awards receive modest monetary incentives.\n\n<ref name=\"artl_Arts\">{{Cite press release\n| title = 2017 National Arts Festival Honours Winners of Standard Bank Ovation Awards\n| author = BWW News Desk\n| via= BroadwayWorld\n| date = 11 July 2017\n| accessdate = 15 November 2017\n| url = https://www.broadwayworld.com/south-africa/article/2017-National-Arts-Festival-Honours-Winners-of-Standard-Bank-Ovation-Awards-20170711\n| language =\n| quote =\n}}</ref>\n\n== Featured Artists ==\n\nSince the Featured Artist Programme was launched in 2012, the National Arts Festival has celebrated and showcased established artists who have built up a substantial body of work that has contributed to South Africa\u2019s national discourse on race, class or gender in a significant way.\n\nRecipients of this award are:\n* 2019: Bernie Searle, visual artist\n* 2018: Mamela Nyamza, dancer and choreographer <ref>\"Mamela Nyanza First Choreographer To Be Named NAF Featured Artist\", http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/01/10/mamela-nyanza-first-choreographer-to-be-named-naf-featured-artist_a_23329703/</ref>\n* 2017: Neo Muyanga, musician and composer\n* 2016: Lara Foot, playwright and director\n* 2015: [[Satire]] (The genre was chosen as the programme centrepiece)\n* 2014: [[Sylvaine Strike]], actor and director\n* 2013: Mike van Graan, playwright and director\n\n== Growth and development ==\n\nThe NAF has grown since its inception.

A drama or dance production is counted as a single event irrespective of how many times it may be performed.) The Fringe started in 1979 with 10 events.

The scholars attended workshops, seminars, performances and visits to galleries while being mentored in arts practice and arts appreciation.\n\nThe Art Factory teaches local marginalised and vulnerable youth performance skills such as juggling and acrobatics and combines this with a strategic focus on building the life skills and confidence of the youth. The Art Factory functions as a year-round project in Grahamstown.\n\nAs part of the ArtsReach Programme the National Arts Festival takes the arts to hospitals, clinics, old age homes and rural areas. A number of artists on the Fringe volunteer their performances for the ArtsReach programme during the NAF.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Arts Encounter Project distributes a number of tickets to indigent individuals to enable them to enjoy productions from the NAF's main and fringe programmes.\n\n== Publications ==\n\nThe National Arts Festival publishes a printed booking kit or programme every year, which includes artistic and schedule information about the shows as well as tips on how to book tickets, getting to Grahamstown and where to stay. A full PDF of the programme is available online via the NAF's website at www.nationalartsfestival.co.za.\n\n== Bookings ==\n\nA computerised booking system was introduced in 1989. In 1997, for the first time in the history of South African theatre, the National Arts Festival introduced internet bookings. The NAF website, which was launched in 1994, acts as an online registration vehicle for artists in the build-up to the Festival, and as a ticket booking hub for the Festival. A free-to-download mobile app has also been developed, which allows visitors to browse shows and book tickets.\n\n== Staff ==\n\nThe National Arts Festival has a small permanent staff comprising around 10 full-time staff members.
