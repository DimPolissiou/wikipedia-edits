The 4 valves per cylinder of the Double Over Head Camshaft ([[DOHC]]) layout ensures low pressure drop and super-efficient valve lift for a higher air filling; thus, allowing the engines to make usable power at low end, mid-range and high-end rev bands.\n\n===Variants===\nThe Kwid was launched with 4 trim levels:\n*'''Renault Kwid Standard''' \u2013 Black bumpers and steel wheels and full size spare, Single tone dashboard, Digital instrument cluster, Grey Upholstery, Heater (no AC), Gearshift indicator, Internal boot release, 2 years' corrosion protection warranty\n*'''Renault Kwid RXE''' \u2013 Steel wheels painted in silver, Satin silver finish on dashboard, AC with heater, Lower glove box (Can be closed), Passenger side sun visor, Engine immobilizer, Optional media pack (Stereo with radio, MP3, Bluetooth, USB, AUX, 2 speakers & 12V socket\n*'''Renault Kwid RXL''' \u2013 Electric power steering, Auto on/off Cabin light, Body coloured bumpers, Passenger side wing mirror, Piano black accent on steering wheel, Satin silver finish around AC vents, Premium front seats, Black with red upholstery, Standard media pack (Stereo with radio, MP3, Bluetooth, USB, AUX, 2 speakers & 12Vsocket)\n*'''Renault Kwid RXT''' \u2013 Dual tone dashboard, Optional driver airbag, Piano black finish on centre console, AC knobs with chrome finish, Front power windows, MediaNAV pack with Navigation system and infotainment, Remote key-less entry with central locking, Front fog lamps, Intermittent front wiper with wash function.(In South Africa the Kwid gets all 4 electric windows as standard as well as a second passenger airbag and electric mirror control for the Dynamique model aka the RXT-O in India). It gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on the top model\n\nRenault applied for the ''Kwid racer'' and ''Kwid climber'' trademarks, what makes observers expect some new variants of the Kwid after October 2015.\n\n===City K-ZE===\n[[File:Renault K-ZE 002.jpg|thumb|left|Renault City K-ZE electric car in China]]\n[[File:Renault K-ZE 003.jpg|thumb|right|Renault City K-ZE electric car rear]]\n{{main|Renault City K-ZE}}\nThe concept for the Renault City K-ZE was shown at the 2018 Paris motor show, and the final production model went on sale before the end of 2019.

The resulting files\u2014typically saved with the <code>[[Text file|.txt]]</code> extension\u2014have no format tags or styles, making the program suitable for editing system files to use in a [[DOS]] environment and, occasionally, source code for later [[Compiler|compilation]] or [[Scripting language|execution]], usually through a [[command line interpreter|command prompt]]. It is also useful for its negligible use of system resources; making for quick load time and processing time, especially on under-powered hardware.\nNotepad supports both left-to-right and right-to-left based languages.\nHistorically, Notepad did not treat [[newline]]s in [[Unix]]- or [[classic Mac OS]]-style text files correctly. However, on 8th May 2018, Microsoft announced that they had fixed this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/extended-eol-in-notepad/|title=Introducing extended line endings support in Notepad|date=May 8, 2018|website=Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=2018-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509202114/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/extended-eol-in-notepad/|archive-date=2018-05-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\nNotepad offers only the most basic text manipulation functions, such as finding text. Only newer versions of Windows include an updated version of Notepad with a search and replace function. However, it has much less functionality in comparison to full-scale editors.\n\nIn all versions of Windows, Notepad uses a built-in [[window class]] named ''EDIT'' and the maximum file size that Notepad can open is dependent on operating system limitations on the size of the ''EDIT'' window class, with the limit being different for each version of Windows. Due to the operating system limit of the ''EDIT'' window class, the Notepad version shipped with [[Windows 3.0]], [[Windows 3.1]] and [[Windows 3.11]] could not open files larger than 54 KB ([[kilobyte]]s) and Microsoft recommended not to open files larger than 45 KB, with the official workaround advice provided by Microsoft being \"Use another text editor\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/59578|title=Maximum File Size Limits for Notepad|date=September 24, 2011|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=2016-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317213210/http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/59578|archive-date=2015-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> but this limit was extended to 64 KB in [[Windows 95]] (and remained the same in [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]), with users now directed to [[WordPad]] to open larger files.

[[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 98|98]] introduced the ability to change this font. As of [[Windows 2000]], the default font was changed to [[Lucida Console]]. The font setting, however, only affects how the text is shown to the user and how it is printed, not how the file is saved to disk. The default font was changed to [[Consolas]] on Windows 8.\n\nUp to [[Windows Me]], there were almost no keyboard shortcuts and no line-counting feature. Starting with [[Windows 2000]], shortcuts for common tasks like new, open and save were added, as well as a status-bar with a line counter (available only when word-wrap is disabled).\n\nIn the [[Windows NT]]-based versions of Windows, Notepad can edit traditional 8-bit text files as well as [[Unicode]] text files (both [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16]], and in case of UTF-16, [[Endianness|both little-endian and big-endian]]).\n\nNotepad also has a simple built-in logging function. Each time a file that starts with <tt>.LOG</tt> is opened, the program inserts a text timestamp on the last line of the file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/81067 |title=Features of LOG and Time/Date Command in Notepad |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |website=Support |date=July 19, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221631/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/81067 |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260563 |title=How to Use Notepad to Create a Log File |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |website=Support |date=December 20, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406104758/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260563 |archivedate=April 6, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNotepad accepts text from the Windows [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]].

Headers, footers, and margins can be set and adjusted when preparing to print a file under ''Page Setup''. The date, file name, and other information can be placed in the headers and footers with various codes consisting of an ampersand ('&') followed by a letter.\n\n\n\nta hist\u00f3ria tem um final triste ent\u00e3o todos os nazistas por favor morram !!\n\n== Unicode detections ==\n{{Main article|Bush hid the facts}}\nThe Windows NT version of Notepad, installed by default on [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]], has the ability to detect Unicode files even when they are missing a [[Byte Order Mark|byte order mark]]. To do this, it utilizes a Windows API function called <code>IsTextUnicode()</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318672(v=vs.85).aspx|title=IsTextUnicode()|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910175750/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318672(v=vs.85).aspx|archive-date=2016-09-10|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this function is imperfect, incorrectly identifying some all-lowercase [[ASCII]] text as UTF-16. As a result, Notepad interprets a file containing a phrase like \"aaaa aaa aaa aaaaa\" (\"4-3-3-5\") as two-byte-encoded Unicode text file and attempts to display it as such. If a font with support for Chinese is installed, nine Chinese characters (\u6874\u7369\u6120\u7070\u6320\u6e61\u6220\u6572\u6b61) display. Otherwise, it displays [[Substitute character|squares]] instead of Chinese characters.\n\nSome people misinterpreted this issue for an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]. Many phrases that fit the pattern (including \"this app can break\" and \"[[bush hid the facts]]\") appeared on the web as [[hoax]]es.

Though Notepad will still be included in Windows out of the box, as of Windows 10 [[Windows 10 version history|version 20H1]], Notepad will no longer be a [[List of Microsoft Windows components|component]] of the operating system and updated through the bi-yearly Windows 10 version updates, and will instead be a separate application receiving updates through the Microsoft Store. This will allow updates to the app to be delivered more frequently.<ref name=\"zdnetmsstore20\">{{cite news |author1=Mary Jo Foley |authorlink1=Mary Jo Foley |title=Microsoft makes Notepad a separate Store app starting with new Windows 10 20H1 test build |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-makes-notepad-a-separate-store-app-starting-with-new-windows-10-20h1-test-build/ |accessdate=August 29, 2019 |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=August 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Mayank Parmar |title=Windows 10 Notepad Added to Microsoft Store, Only for Insiders |url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-notepad-added-to-microsoft-store-only-for-insiders/ |accessdate=August 29, 2019 |work=[[Bleeping Computer]] |date=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nNotepad is a common text-only ([[plain text]]) editor. The resulting files\u2014typically saved with the <code>[[Text file|.txt]]</code> extension\u2014have no format tags or styles, making the program suitable for editing system files to use in a [[DOS]] environment and, occasionally, source code for later [[Compiler|compilation]] or [[Scripting language|execution]], usually through a [[command line interpreter|command prompt]]. It is also useful for its negligible use of system resources; making for quick load time and processing time, especially on under-powered hardware.\nNotepad supports both left-to-right and right-to-left based languages.\nHistorically, Notepad did not treat [[newline]]s in [[Unix]]- or [[classic Mac OS]]-style text files correctly. However, on 8th May 2018, Microsoft announced that they had fixed this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/extended-eol-in-notepad/|title=Introducing extended line endings support in Notepad|date=May 8, 2018|website=Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=2018-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509202114/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/extended-eol-in-notepad/|archive-date=2018-05-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\nNotepad offers only the most basic text manipulation functions, such as finding text. Only newer versions of Windows include an updated version of Notepad with a search and replace function. However, it has much less functionality in comparison to full-scale editors.\n\nIn all versions of Windows, Notepad uses a built-in [[window class]] named ''EDIT'' and the maximum file size that Notepad can open is dependent on operating system limitations on the size of the ''EDIT'' window class, with the limit being different for each version of Windows. Due to the operating system limit of the ''EDIT'' window class, the Notepad version shipped with [[Windows 3.0]], [[Windows 3.1]] and [[Windows 3.11]] could not open files larger than 54 KB ([[kilobyte]]s) and Microsoft recommended not to open files larger than 45 KB, with the official workaround advice provided by Microsoft being \"Use another text editor\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/59578|title=Maximum File Size Limits for Notepad|date=September 24, 2011|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=2016-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317213210/http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/59578|archive-date=2015-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> but this limit was extended to 64 KB in [[Windows 95]] (and remained the same in [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]), with users now directed to [[WordPad]] to open larger files. On the Notepad version shipped with Windows XP the limit was 32 MB ([[megabyte]]s) with the application displaying the message \"The file is too large for Notepad. Use another editor to edit the file\" if the user attempted to open a file larger than 32 MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bytes.com/topic/desktop-software/answers/727862-what-file-size-limit-notepad-windows-xp|title=What is file size limit for Notepad in Windows XP|date=October 24, 2007|publisher=Bytes|access-date=2016-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029045531/https://bytes.com/topic/desktop-software/answers/727862-what-file-size-limit-notepad-windows-xp|archive-date=2016-10-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Newer versions of Notepad can open files at least up to 58 MB ([[megabyte]]s) in size,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/434501/Maximum-size-for-notepad-file|title=Maximum size for notepad file|date=August 4, 2012|publisher=Code Project|access-date=2016-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029043858/http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/434501/Maximum-size-for-notepad-file|archive-date=2016-10-29|url-status=live}}</ref> and on [[Windows 8.1]] the Notepad application is able to open files at least as large as 512 MB (megabytes) but fails to open 1 GB (gigabyte) files displaying the same message that Windows XP users would see (\"The file is too large for Notepad.

[[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 98|98]] introduced the ability to change this font. As of [[Windows 2000]], the default font was changed to [[Lucida Console]]. The font setting, however, only affects how the text is shown to the user and how it is printed, not how the file is saved to disk. The default font was changed to [[Consolas]] on Windows 8.\n\nUp to [[Windows Me]], there were almost no keyboard shortcuts and no line-counting feature. Starting with [[Windows 2000]], shortcuts for common tasks like new, open and save were added, as well as a status-bar with a line counter (available only when word-wrap is disabled).\n\nIn the [[Windows NT]]-based versions of Windows, Notepad can edit traditional 8-bit text files as well as [[Unicode]] text files (both [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16]], and in case of UTF-16, [[Endianness|both little-endian and big-endian]]).\n\nNotepad also has a simple built-in logging function. Each time a file that starts with <tt>.LOG</tt> is opened, the program inserts a text timestamp on the last line of the file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/81067 |title=Features of LOG and Time/Date Command in Notepad |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |website=Support |date=July 19, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221631/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/81067 |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260563 |title=How to Use Notepad to Create a Log File |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |website=Support |date=December 20, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406104758/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260563 |archivedate=April 6, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNotepad accepts text from the Windows [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]]. When clipboard data with multiple formats is pasted into Notepad, the program only accepts text in the <tt>CF_TEXT</tt> format.<ref>\"{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/360/15_clipboard_f03.html|title=The Clipboard|accessdate=September 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035433/http://cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/360/15_clipboard_f03.html|archive-date=2009-02-26|url-status=live}}</ref> This is useful for stripping embedded font type and style codes from formatted text, such as when copying text from a web page and pasting into an email message or other [[WYSIWYG]] text editor. Formatted text can be temporarily pasted into Notepad, and then immediately copied again in stripped format to paste into the other program.\n\nSuperscripts with a space as in 98.6 o Fahrenheit and 3 2 = 9, and subscripts without a space as in H2O, can be understood in Notepad.{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\nNotepad can print files, but doesn't  print correctly if ''Word Wrap'' is turned on. Headers, footers, and margins can be set and adjusted when preparing to print a file under ''Page Setup''. The date, file name, and other information can be placed in the headers and footers with various codes consisting of an ampersand ('&') followed by a letter.\n\n== Unicode detections ==\n{{Main article|Bush hid the facts}}\nThe Windows NT version of Notepad, installed by default on [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]], has the ability to detect Unicode files even when they are missing a [[Byte Order Mark|byte order mark]]. To do this, it utilizes a Windows API function called <code>IsTextUnicode()</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318672(v=vs.85).aspx|title=IsTextUnicode()|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910175750/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318672(v=vs.85).aspx|archive-date=2016-09-10|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this function is imperfect, incorrectly identifying some all-lowercase [[ASCII]] text as UTF-16. As a result, Notepad interprets a file containing a phrase like \"aaaa aaa aaa aaaaa\" (\"4-3-3-5\") as two-byte-encoded Unicode text file and attempts to display it as such. If a font with support for Chinese is installed, nine Chinese characters (\u6874\u7369\u6120\u7070\u6320\u6e61\u6220\u6572\u6b61) display. Otherwise, it displays [[Substitute character|squares]] instead of Chinese characters.\n\nSome people misinterpreted this issue for an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]. Many phrases that fit the pattern (including \"this app can break\" and \"[[bush hid the facts]]\") appeared on the web as [[hoax]]es. Windows expert [[Raymond Chen (Microsoft)#Blogs|Raymond Chen]] correctly attributed it to the Unicode detection algorithm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070417-00/?p=27223|title=The Notepad file encoding problem, redux|last=Chen|first=Raymond|date=April 17, 2007|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903031351/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/17/2158334.aspx|archive-date=2011-09-03|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> This issue was resolved in [[Windows Vista]] and newer versions of Notepad.\n\n== Competing software ==\nNotepad does not require a [[File locking|lock]] on the file it opens, so it can open files already opened by other processes, users, or computers, whereas WordPad cannot.
