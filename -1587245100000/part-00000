Founded in 1988, it is meant to be a parody of the daily news, which airs right before the program, but ''Striscia'' also satirizes government corruption and exposes scams with the help of local reporters who are also comedians. The program is directed and produced by Antonio Ricci and is hosted by two major comedians. Usually [[Ezio Greggio]] (who co-founded the show with [[Gianfranco D'Angelo]]) is assisted by another comedian (such as [[Enzo Iacchetti]] or [[Michelle Hunziker]]) for the winter season, after which there is a change of guard with the two comedians [[Ficarra & Picone]].\n\nThe name of the show literally translates in English as \"the news slither\". The [[Polysemy|polysemic]] term ''striscia'' ({{lang-en|strip}}) refers to a [[cartoon strip]] (noun) while its [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] ''strisciare'' is a verb which means \"to crawl\" or \"to slither\", thus allegorically referring to a worm or snake which slithers and bores underground digging holes and exposing \"cheats\".\n\n==The Gabibbo==\nThe [[Gabibbo]], an Italian [[cultural icon]], acts as the mascot and is the soul of the show. Gabibbo is a caricature of an Italian layman, a low-income worker who lives near the docks of [[Genoa]]. Always loud, braggart but pungent in his naive but straightforward ways, he butts in everywhere he sees new friends to chat to with a childlike enthusiasm always running after the [[Striscia la notizia#The veline|veline]], the show's two dancing showgirls. He is, in some ways, like the Cockney type often seen in British comedies.\n\n==The ''veline''==\n{{redirect|Velina|the Italian village in Campania|Velina (Castelnuovo Cilento)}}\n{{Redirect|Velina|the gens Velina|Velina (gens Velina)}}\nThe term ''velina'' ({{lang-en|tissue paper}}) is a figurative term in Italian journalism which refers to government-issued propagated news. It is a parody of the news industry during the Fascist era under the [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] where the government controlled and heavily censored all news reports and papers.\n\nWithin Striscia, the ''veline'' are two young women in their early twenties (one blonde, the other brunette) who come on stage to hand the \"news anchors\" their news and perform short dances called ''stacchetti'', always finishing up on the news anchors' desk.\n\nThe names of the ''veline'' for each season of Striscia are announced after a long beauty pageant during the summer. The program is called ''Veline''. A similar program, \"Velone\" (which means \"big ''veline''\"), is a contest for women in their 60s (although some are nearly 100){{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. As in \"Veline,\" the women dance and perform in brief sketches.\nThe word ''velina'' has become a synonym for television presenters's assistant. In 2012 also ''velinismo'' [English: Velinism] (to become famous for passiveness and inconclusiveness) became an entry in the [[Zingarelli|Zingarelli dictionary]].\n\n===The ''veline''===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Names!!Years\n|-\n|[[Cristina Prevosti]], [[Stefania Dall'Olio]], [[Eliette Mariangelo]], [[Micaela Verdiani]] ||1988\n|-\n|[[Jordy Gordon]], [[Indra Smith]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]], <br>[[Terry Sessa]], [[Annalisa Gambi]] (not all the season)||1989/1990\n|-\n|[[Laura Paternoster]], [[Monica Spreafico]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]],<br> [[Terry Sessa]], [[Sonia Grey]], [[Angela Cavagna]] (the nurse)||1990/1991\n|-\n|[[Ana Laura Ribas]], [[Terry Sessa]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]]||1991/1992\n|-\n|[[Cecilia Belli]], [[Fanny Cadeo]]||1992/1993\n|-\n|[[Cecilia Belli]], [[Laura Valci]], [[Fanny Cadeo]]||1993/1994\n|-\n|[[Miriana Trevisan]], [[Laura Freddi]] ||1994/1995\n|-\n|[[Alessia Merz]], [[Cristina Quaranta]]||1995/1996\n|-\n|[[Roberta Lanfranchi]], [[Marina Graziani]]||1996/1997\n|-\n|[[Alessia Mancini]], [[Marina Graziani]] ||1997/1998\n|-\n|[[Roberta Lanfranchi]], [[Marina Graziani]]||1998/1999\n|-\n|[[Maddalena Corvaglia]], [[Elisabetta Canalis]]||1999/2002\n|-\n|[[Giorgia Palmas]], [[Elena Barolo]] ||2002/2004\n|-\n|[[Lucia Galeone]], [[Vera Atyushkina]]||2004/2005\n|-\n|[[Melissa Satta]], [[Thais Souza Wiggers]]||2005/2007\n|-\n|[[Melissa Satta]], [[Veridiana Mallman]]||2008\n|-\n|[[Federica Nargi]], [[Costanza Caracciolo]]||2008/2012\n|-\n|[[Alessia Reato]], [[Giulia Calcaterra]]||2012/2013\n|-\n|[[Irene Cioni]], [[Ludovica Frasca]]||2013/2017\n|-\n|[[Shaila Gatta]], [[Mikaela Neaze Silva]]||2017/Today\n|}<br />\n\n== The Reporters ==\n\n* Max Laudadio - North-West\n* Moreno Morello - North-East\n* Chiara Squaglia - [[:it:Toscana|Toscana]]\n* Jimmy Ghione - [[:it:Lazio|Lazio]], animals\n* Alessio Giannone (alias ''Pinuccio'') - [[:it:Abruzzo|Abruzzo]], [[:it:Molise|Molise]], [[:it:Puglia|Puglia]] e [[:it:Basilicata|Basilicata]]\n* Luca Abete - [[:it:Campania|Campania]]\n* Erica Cunsolo (alias ''Erica Senza K'') - [[:it:Calabria|Calabria]]\n* Stefania Petyx and the [[:it:Bassotto|bassotto]] - [[:it:Sicilia|Sicilia]]\n* Gabibbo - waste and injustice\n* Valerio Staffelli - Tapiro d'Oro, injustices and scams\n* Vittorio Brumotti (alias ''100% Brumotti'') - buildings never completed or never entered into operation, contrast to drug dealing and to those who occupy parking spaces reserved for the disabled\n* Cristiano Militello - Reports ''Striscia lo striscione'' e ''Striscia il cartellone''\n* Antonio Casanova - waste and injustice\n* Cristina Gabetti - Report ''Occhio al futuro - 17 globla goals''\n* Luca Galtieri (alias ''Galtieuro'')\n* Philippe Daverio - Report ''MUAGG-IThe free museum''\n* Fabrizio Fontana (alias ''Capitan Ventosa'')<ref>[http://www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/news/2014/02/11/news_7949.shtml Striscia la Notizia - A Striscia la notizia Capitan Ventosa e la difficolt\u00e0 di \"ricaricare\" le auto elettriche<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->]</ref>\n* Davide Rampello - Report ''Paesi, paesaggi...''\n* Luca Sardella - Report ''Speranza verde''\n* Rajae Bezzaz - immigration and integration\n* Riccardo Trombetta - injustices and scams\n* Roberto Lipari (dal 18 novembre [[:it:2019|2019]])<ref>{{Cita web|url=https://www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/news/roberto-lipari-debutta-come-nuovo-inviato-di-striscia-con-il-caso-dell-imu-non-pagata-dal-ministero-della-difesa_9802.shtml|titolo=Roberto Lipari debutta come nuovo inviato di Striscia con il caso... - News|sito=Striscia la Notizia|accesso=18 novembre 2019}}</ref>\n* Paolo Marchi - Report ''Capolavori italiani in cucina''<ref name=\":3\">{{Cita web|url=https://spettacolomusicasport.com/2019/12/03/striscia-la-notizia-al-via-la-nuova-rubrica-di-paolo-marchi-capolavori-italiani-in-cucina/|titolo=STRISCIA LA NOTIZIA: AL VIA LA NUOVA RUBRICA DI PAOLO MARCHI \u201cCAPOLAVORI ITALIANI IN CUCINA\u201d|autore=francy279|data=3 dicembre 2019|accesso=4 dicembre 2019}}</ref>\n* Marco Camisani Calzolari (in arte ''MCC'') - digital culture\n\n==The ''Tapiro d'Oro''==\n[[File:Tapiro d'Oro.JPG|thumb|The ''Tapiro d'Oro'']]\nThe ''Tapiro d'Oro'' (''Golden Tapir''), a small golden statue, is a special \"prize\" delivered to big celebrities or politicians who have been humiliated or defeated. Although many personalities take it in front of the cameras in the hope of getting attention for themselves, others run away and Valerio Staffelli, a special correspondent for the show, has to run after them until they finally take it. Some even react aggressively. [[Rai Uno]] Director [[Fabrizio Del Noce]], cornered by Staffelli, banged his microphone on the reporter's face, breaking Staffelli's nose.\n\n==Subtitles==\n\nEach edition of Strip uses a subtitle always different, which reads the voice of-enza.\n\n{| class=\"wikita\n|-\n!

Founded in 1988, it is meant to be a parody of the daily news, which airs right before the program, but ''Striscia'' also satirizes government corruption and exposes scams with the help of local reporters who are also comedians. The program is directed and produced by Antonio Ricci and is hosted by two major comedians. Usually [[Ezio Greggio]] (who co-founded the show with [[Gianfranco D'Angelo]]) is assisted by another comedian (such as [[Enzo Iacchetti]] or [[Michelle Hunziker]]) for the winter season, after which there is a change of guard with the two comedians [[Ficarra & Picone]].\n\nThe name of the show literally translates in English as \"the news slither\". The [[Polysemy|polysemic]] term ''striscia'' ({{lang-en|strip}}) refers to a [[cartoon strip]] (noun) while its [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] ''strisciare'' is a verb which means \"to crawl\" or \"to slither\", thus allegorically referring to a worm or snake which slithers and bores underground digging holes and exposing \"cheats\".\n\n==The Gabibbo==\nThe [[Gabibbo]], an Italian [[cultural icon]], acts as the mascot and is the soul of the show. Gabibbo is a caricature of an Italian layman, a low-income worker who lives near the docks of [[Genoa]]. Always loud, braggart but pungent in his naive but straightforward ways, he butts in everywhere he sees new friends to chat to with a childlike enthusiasm always running after the [[Striscia la notizia#The veline|veline]], the show's two dancing showgirls. He is, in some ways, like the Cockney type often seen in British comedies.\n\n==The ''veline''==\n{{redirect|Velina|the Italian village in Campania|Velina (Castelnuovo Cilento)}}\n{{Redirect|Velina|the gens Velina|Velina (gens Velina)}}\nThe term ''velina'' ({{lang-en|tissue paper}}) is a figurative term in Italian journalism which refers to government-issued propagated news. It is a parody of the news industry during the Fascist era under the [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] where the government controlled and heavily censored all news reports and papers.\n\nWithin Striscia, the ''veline'' are two young women in their early twenties (one blonde, the other brunette) who come on stage to hand the \"news anchors\" their news and perform short dances called ''stacchetti'', always finishing up on the news anchors' desk.\n\nThe names of the ''veline'' for each season of Striscia are announced after a long beauty pageant during the summer. The program is called ''Veline''. A similar program, \"Velone\" (which means \"big ''veline''\"), is a contest for women in their 60s (although some are nearly 100){{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. As in \"Veline,\" the women dance and perform in brief sketches.\nThe word ''velina'' has become a synonym for television presenters's assistant. In 2012 also ''velinismo'' [English: Velinism] (to become famous for passiveness and inconclusiveness) became an entry in the [[Zingarelli|Zingarelli dictionary]].\n\n===The ''veline''===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Names!!Years\n|-\n|[[Cristina Prevosti]], [[Stefania Dall'Olio]], [[Eliette Mariangelo]], [[Micaela Verdiani]] ||1988\n|-\n|[[Jordy Gordon]], [[Indra Smith]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]], <br>[[Terry Sessa]], [[Annalisa Gambi]] (not all the season)||1989/1990\n|-\n|[[Laura Paternoster]], [[Monica Spreafico]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]],<br> [[Terry Sessa]], [[Sonia Grey]], [[Angela Cavagna]] (the nurse)||1990/1991\n|-\n|[[Ana Laura Ribas]], [[Terry Sessa]], [[Simonetta Pravettoni]]||1991/1992\n|-\n|[[Cecilia Belli]], [[Fanny Cadeo]]||1992/1993\n|-\n|[[Cecilia Belli]], [[Laura Valci]], [[Fanny Cadeo]]||1993/1994\n|-\n|[[Miriana Trevisan]], [[Laura Freddi]] ||1994/1995\n|-\n|[[Alessia Merz]], [[Cristina Quaranta]]||1995/1996\n|-\n|[[Roberta Lanfranchi]], [[Marina Graziani]]||1996/1997\n|-\n|[[Alessia Mancini]], [[Marina Graziani]] ||1997/1998\n|-\n|[[Roberta Lanfranchi]], [[Marina Graziani]]||1998/1999\n|-\n|[[Maddalena Corvaglia]], [[Elisabetta Canalis]]||1999/2002\n|-\n|[[Giorgia Palmas]], [[Elena Barolo]] ||2002/2004\n|-\n|[[Lucia Galeone]], [[Vera Atyushkina]]||2004/2005\n|-\n|[[Melissa Satta]], [[Thais Souza Wiggers]]||2005/2007\n|-\n|[[Melissa Satta]], [[Veridiana Mallman]]||2008\n|-\n|[[Federica Nargi]], [[Costanza Caracciolo]]||2008/2012\n|-\n|[[Alessia Reato]], [[Giulia Calcaterra]]||2012/2013\n|-\n|[[Irene Cioni]], [[Ludovica Frasca]]||2013/2017\n|-\n|[[Shaila Gatta]], [[Mikaela Neaze Silva]]||2017/Today\n|}<br />\n\n== The Reporters ==\n\n* Max Laudadio - North-West\n* Moreno Morello - North-East\n* Chiara Squaglia - [[:it:Toscana|Toscana]]\n* Jimmy Ghione - [[:it:Lazio|Lazio]], animals\n* Alessio Giannone (alias ''Pinuccio'') - [[:it:Abruzzo|Abruzzo]], [[:it:Molise|Molise]], [[:it:Puglia|Puglia]] e [[:it:Basilicata|Basilicata]]\n* Luca Abete - [[:it:Campania|Campania]]\n* Erica Cunsolo (alias ''Erica Senza K'') - [[:it:Calabria|Calabria]]\n* Stefania Petyx and the [[:it:Bassotto|bassotto]] - [[:it:Sicilia|Sicilia]]\n* Gabibbo - waste and injustice\n* Valerio Staffelli - Tapiro d'Oro, injustices and scams\n* Vittorio Brumotti (alias ''100% Brumotti'') - buildings never completed or never entered into operation, contrast to drug dealing and to those who occupy parking spaces reserved for the disabled\n* Cristiano Militello - headings ''Striscia lo striscione'' e ''Striscia il cartellone''\n* Antonio Casanova - waste and injustice\n* Cristina Gabetti - rubrica ''Occhio al futuro - 17 globla goals''\n* Luca Galtieri (alias ''Galtieuro'')\n* Philippe Daverio - headings ''MUAGG-IThe free museum''\n* Fabrizio Fontana (alias ''Capitan Ventosa'')<ref>[http://www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/news/2014/02/11/news_7949.shtml Striscia la Notizia - A Striscia la notizia Capitan Ventosa e la difficolt\u00e0 di \"ricaricare\" le auto elettriche<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->]</ref>\n* Davide Rampello - heading ''Paesi, paesaggi...''\n* Luca Sardella - heading ''Speranza verde''\n* Rajae Bezzaz - immigration and integration\n* Riccardo Trombetta - injustices and scams\n* Roberto Lipari (dal 18 novembre [[:it:2019|2019]])<ref>{{Cita web|url=https://www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/news/roberto-lipari-debutta-come-nuovo-inviato-di-striscia-con-il-caso-dell-imu-non-pagata-dal-ministero-della-difesa_9802.shtml|titolo=Roberto Lipari debutta come nuovo inviato di Striscia con il caso... - News|sito=Striscia la Notizia|accesso=18 novembre 2019}}</ref>\n* Paolo Marchi - heading ''Capolavori italiani in cucina''<ref name=\":3\">{{Cita web|url=https://spettacolomusicasport.com/2019/12/03/striscia-la-notizia-al-via-la-nuova-rubrica-di-paolo-marchi-capolavori-italiani-in-cucina/|titolo=STRISCIA LA NOTIZIA: AL VIA LA NUOVA RUBRICA DI PAOLO MARCHI \u201cCAPOLAVORI ITALIANI IN CUCINA\u201d|autore=francy279|data=3 dicembre 2019|accesso=4 dicembre 2019}}</ref>\n* Marco Camisani Calzolari (in arte ''MCC'') - digital culture\n\n==The ''Tapiro d'Oro''==\n[[File:Tapiro d'Oro.JPG|thumb|The ''Tapiro d'Oro'']]\nThe ''Tapiro d'Oro'' (''Golden Tapir''), a small golden statue, is a special \"prize\" delivered to big celebrities or politicians who have been humiliated or defeated. Although many personalities take it in front of the cameras in the hope of getting attention for themselves, others run away and Valerio Staffelli, a special correspondent for the show, has to run after them until they finally take it. Some even react aggressively. [[Rai Uno]] Director [[Fabrizio Del Noce]], cornered by Staffelli, banged his microphone on the reporter's face, breaking Staffelli's nose.\n\n==Subtitles==\n\nEach edition of Strip uses a subtitle always different, which reads the voice of-enza.\n\n{| class=\"wikita\n|-\n!

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.
