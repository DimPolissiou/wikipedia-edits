In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the

This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304163310/https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|archive-date=4 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227192432/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |archive-date=27 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324094050/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n{{Portal bar|COVID-19|Singapore|Medicine|Viruses}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCase details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}

The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\n\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are ''concatenative synthesis'' and ''[[formant]] synthesis''. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\n\n=== Concatenation synthesis ===\n{{main|Concatenative synthesis}}\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the [[concatenation]] (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\n\n==== Unit selection synthesis ====\n\nUnit selection synthesis uses large [[database]]s of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual [[phone (phonetics)|phones]], [[diphone]]s, half-phones, [[syllable]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified [[speech recognition|speech recognizer]] set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the [[waveform]] and [[spectrogram]].<ref>[[Alan W. Black]], [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/papers/IEEE2002/allthetime/allthetime.html Perfect synthesis for all of the people all of the time.] IEEE TTS Workshop 2002.</ref> An [[index (database)|index]] of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the [[fundamental frequency]] ([[pitch (music)|pitch]]), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted [[decision tree]].\n\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the [[gigabyte]]s of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech.<ref>John Kominek and [[Alan W. Black]]. (2003). CMU ARCTIC databases for speech synthesis. CMU-LTI-03-177.

The number of diphones depends on the [[phonotactics]] of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of [[digital signal processing]] techniques such as [[linear predictive coding]], [[PSOLA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |title=Pitch-Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA) Synthesis |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222180903/http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref> or [[MBROLA]].<ref>T.

It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports.<ref>L.F. Lamel, J.L. Gauvain, B. Prouts, C. Bouhier, R. Boesch. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.6101&rep=rep1&type=pdf Generation and Synthesis of Broadcast Messages], ''Proceedings ESCA-NATO Workshop and Applications of Speech Technology'', September 1993.</ref>  The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] dialects of English the ''\"r\"'' in words like ''\"clear\"'' {{IPA|/\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259/}} is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. ''\"clear out\"'' is realized as {{IPA|/\u02cckl\u026a\u0259\u0279\u02c8\u028c\u028at/}}). Likewise in [[French language|French]], many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]. This [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]].\n\n=== Formant synthesis ===\n\n[[Formant]] synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using [[additive synthesis]] and an acoustic model ([[physical modelling synthesis]]).<ref>Dartmouth College: [http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html ''Music and Computers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608035309/http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html |date=2011-06-08 }}, 1993.</ref> Parameters such as [[fundamental frequency]], [[phonation|voicing]], and [[noise]] levels are varied over time to create a [[waveform]] of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called ''rules-based synthesis''; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components.\nMany systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a [[screen reader]]. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in [[embedded system]]s, where [[data storage device|memory]] and [[microprocessor]] power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]s can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\n\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the [[Texas Instruments]] toy [[Speak & Spell (game)|Speak & Spell]], and in the early 1980s [[Sega]] [[Video arcade|arcade]] machines<ref>Examples include [[Astro Blaster]], [[Space Fury]], and [[Star Trek (arcade game)|Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator]]</ref> and in many [[Atari, Inc.]] arcade games<ref>Examples include [[Star Wars (arcade game)|Star Wars]], [[Firefox (arcade game)|Firefox]], [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (arcade game)|Return of the Jedi]], [[Road Runner (video game)|Road Runner]], [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (arcade game)|The Empire Strikes Back]], [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]], [[720\u00b0]], [[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]], [[Gauntlet II]], [[A.P.B.

The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the mid-1970s by [[Philip Rubin]], Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at [[Bell Laboratories]] in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\n\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the [[NeXT]]-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the [[University of Calgary]], where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by [[Steve Jobs]] in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as [[gnuspeech]]. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\n\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronqui, traquea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cic.unb.br/~lucero/papers/768_Paper.pdf|title = Physics-based synthesis of disordered voices|last = Lucero|first = J.

range:\n\n<math>loss=\\alpha loss_{human} + (1 - \\alpha) loss_{other}</math>\n\nwhere <math>loss_{human}</math> is the loss from human voice band and <math>\\alpha</math> is a scalar typically around 0.5.\nThe acoustic feature is typically [[Spectrogram]] or spectrogram in [[Mel scale]].\nThese features capture the time-frequency relation of speech signal and thus, \nit is sufficient to generate intelligent outputs with these acoustic features.\nThe [[Mel-frequency cepstrum]] feature used in the speech recognition task is not suitable for speech synthesis because it reduces too much information.\n\n==== Brief History ====\nIn September 2016, [[DeepMind]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499 WaveNet], a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. \nThis shows the community that deep learning-based models have the capability to model raw waveforms and perform well on generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or spectrograms in mel scale, \nor even from some preprocessed linguistic features. \nIn early 2017, [[Mila (research institute)]] proposed [https://mila.quebec/en/publication/char2wav-end-to-end-speech-synthesis/ char2wav], \na model to produce raw waveform in an end-to-end method. \nAlso, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135 Tacotron] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06588 VoiceLoop], respectively, \nto generate acoustic features directly from the input text.\nIn the later in the same year, Google proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884 Tacotron2] which combined the WaveNet vocoder with the revised Tacotron architecture to perform end-to-end speech synthesis.\nTacotron2 can generate high-quality speech approaching the human voice. \nSince then, end-to-end methods became the hottest research topic because many researchers around the world start to notice the power of the end-to-end speech synthesizer.\n\n==== Advantages and Disadvantages ====\n\nThe advantages of end-to-end methods are as follows:\n* Only need a single model to perform text analysis, acoustic modeling and audio synthesis, i.e. synthesizing speech directly from characters\n** Less feature engineering\n** Easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, e.g. speaker or language\n** Adaptation to new data is easier\n** More robust than multi-stage models because no component's error can compound\n* Powerful model capacity to capture the hidden internal structures of data\n* Capable to generate intelligible and natural speech\n* No need to maintain a large database, i.e. small footprint\n\nDespite there are many advantages mentioned, end-to-end methods still have many challenges to be solved:\n* Auto-regressive-based models suffer from slow inference problem\n* Output speech are not robust when data are not sufficient\n* Lack of controllability compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches\n* Tend to learn the flat prosody by averaging over training data\n* Tend to output smoothed acoustic features because the l1 or l2 loss is used\n\n==== Challenges ====\n\n- ''Slow inference problem''\n\nTo solve the slow inference problem, [[Microsoft]] research and [[Baidu]] research both proposed use non-auto-regressive models to make the inference process faster.\nThe [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263 FastSpeech] model proposed by Microsoft use Transformer architecture with a duration model to achieve the goal. \nBesides, the duration model which borrows from traditional methods makes the speech production more robust.\n\n- ''Robustness problem''\n\nResearchers found that the robustness problem is strongly related to the text alignment failures, \nand this drives many researchers to revise the attention mechanism which utilize the strong local relation and monotonic properties of speech. \n\n- ''Controllability problem''\n\nTo solve the controllability problem, many works about variational auto-encoder are proposed.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Hsu |first=Wei-Ning |author-link= |eprint=1810.07217 |title=Hierarchical Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Habib |first=Raza |author-link= |eprint=1910.01709 |title=Semi-Supervised Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2019 }}</ref>\n\n- ''Flat prosody problem''\n\nGST-Tacotron can slightly alleviate the flat prosody problem, however, it still depends on the training data.\n\n- ''Smoothed acoustic output problem''\n\nTo generate more realistic acoustic features, GAN learning strategy can be applied.\n\nHowever, in practice, neural vocoder can generalize well even when the input features are more smooth than real data.\n\n==== Semi-supervised Learning ====\n\nCurrently, self-supervised learning gain a lot of attention because of better utilizing unlabelled data.\nResearch <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chung |first=Yu-An |author-link= |eprint=1808.10128 |title=Semi-Supervised Training for Improving Data Efficiency in End-to-End Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Ren |first=Yi |author-link= |eprint=1905.06791 |title=Almost Unsupervised Text to Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition |class=cs.CL |date=2019 }}</ref> shows that with the aid of self-supervised loss, the need of paired data decreases.\n\n==== Zero-shot Speaker Adaptation ====\n\nZero-shot speaker adaptation is promising because a single model can generate speech with various speaker styles and characteristic.\nIn June 2018, Google proposed to use pre-trained speaker verification model as speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Jia |first=Ye |author-link= |eprint=1806.04558 |title=Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref>.\nThe speaker encoder then becomes a part of the neural text-to-speech model and it can decide the style and characteristic of the output speech.\nThis shows the community that only using a single model to generate speech of multiple style is possible.\n\n==== Neural Vocoder ====\n\nNeural vocoder plays a important role in deep learning-based speech synthesis to generate high-quality speech from acoustic features.\nThe [[WaveNet]] model proposed in 2016 achieves great performance on speech quality.\nWavenet factorised the joint probability of a waveform <math>\\mathbf{x}=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\}</math> as a product of conditional probabilities as follows\n\n<math>p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1})</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter including many dilated convolution layers.\nTherefore, each audio sample <math>x_t</math> is therefore conditioned on the samples at all previous timesteps.\nHowever, the auto-regressive nature of WaveNet makes the inference process dramatically slow.\nTo solve the slow inference problem that comes from the auto-regressive characteristic of WaveNet model, \nParallel WaveNet<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=van den Oord |first=Aaron  |author-link= |eprint=1711.10433 |title=Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref> is proposed.\nParallel WaveNet is an inverse autoregressive flow-based model which is trained by knowledge distillation with a pre-trained teacher WaveNet model.\nSince inverse autoregressive flow-based model is non-auto-regressive when performing inference, the inference speed is faster than real-time.\nIn the meanwhile, [[Nvidia]] proposed a flow-based WaveGlow <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Prenger |first=Ryan |author-link= |eprint=1811.00002 |title=WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis |class=cs.SD |date=2018 }}</ref> model which can also generate speech with faster than real-time speed.\nHowever, despite the high inference speed, \nparallel WaveNet has the limitation of the need of a pre-trained WaveNet model and WaveGlow takes many weeks to converge with limited computing devices.\nThis issue is solved by Parallel WaveGAN <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Yamamoto |first=Ryuichi |author-link= |eprint=1910.11480 |title=Parallel WaveGAN: A fast waveform generation model based on generative adversarial networks with multi-resolution spectrogram |class=eess.AS |date=2019 }}</ref> which learns to produce speech by multi-resolution spectral loss and GANs learning strategy.\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Text normalization challenges ===\n\nThe process of normalizing text is rarely straightforward. Texts are full of [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s, [[number]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s that all require expansion into a phonetic representation. There are many spellings in English which are pronounced differently based on context. For example, \"My latest project is to learn how to better project my voice\" contains two pronunciations of \"project\".\n\nMost text-to-speech (TTS) systems do not generate [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantic]] representations of their input texts, as processes for doing so are unreliable, poorly understood, and computationally ineffective. As a result, various [[heuristic]] techniques are used to guess the proper way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s, like examining neighboring words and using statistics about frequency of occurrence.\n\nRecently TTS systems have begun to use HMMs (discussed above) to generate \"[[Part-of-speech tagging|parts of speech]]\" to aid in disambiguating homographs.  This technique is quite successful for many cases such as whether \"read\" should be pronounced as \"red\" implying past tense, or as \"reed\" implying present tense.  Typical error rates when using HMMs in this fashion are usually below five percent.  These techniques also work well for most European languages, although access to required training [[Text corpus|corpora]] is frequently difficult in these languages.\n\nDeciding how to convert numbers is another problem that TTS systems have to address. It is a simple programming challenge to convert a number into words (at least in English), like \"1325\" becoming \"one thousand three hundred twenty-five.\" However, numbers occur in many different contexts; \"1325\" may also be read as \"one three two five\", \"thirteen twenty-five\" or \"thirteen hundred and twenty five\". A TTS system can often infer how to expand a number based on surrounding words, numbers, and punctuation, and sometimes the system provides a way to specify the context if it is ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web | title = Speech synthesis | publisher = World Wide Web Organization | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.1.8}}</ref> Roman numerals can also be read differently depending on context.  For example, \"Henry VIII\" reads as \"Henry the Eighth\", while \"Chapter VIII\" reads as \"Chapter Eight\".\n\nSimilarly, abbreviations can be ambiguous. For example, the abbreviation \"in\" for \"inches\" must be differentiated from the word \"in\", and the address \"12 St John St.\" uses the same abbreviation for both \"Saint\" and \"Street\". TTS systems with intelligent front ends can make educated guesses about ambiguous abbreviations, while others provide the same result in all cases, resulting in nonsensical (and sometimes comical) outputs, such as \"[[Ulysses S. Grant]]\" being rendered as \"Ulysses South Grant\".\n\n=== Text-to-phoneme challenges ===\n\nSpeech synthesis systems use two basic approaches to determine the pronunciation of a word based on its [[spelling]], a process which is often called text-to-phoneme or [[grapheme]]-to-phoneme conversion ([[phoneme]] is the term used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] to describe distinctive sounds in a [[language]]). The simplest approach to text-to-phoneme conversion is the dictionary-based approach, where a large dictionary containing all the words of a language and their correct [[pronunciation]]s is stored by the program. Determining the correct pronunciation of each word is a matter of looking up each word in the dictionary and replacing the spelling with the pronunciation specified in the dictionary. The other approach is rule-based, in which pronunciation rules are applied to words to determine their pronunciations based on their spellings. This is similar to the \"sounding out\", or [[synthetic phonics]], approach to learning reading.\n\nEach approach has advantages and drawbacks. The dictionary-based approach is quick and accurate, but completely fails if it is given a word which is not in its dictionary. As dictionary size grows, so too does the memory space requirements of the synthesis system. On the other hand, the rule-based approach works on any input, but the complexity of the rules grows substantially as the system takes into account irregular spellings or pronunciations. (Consider that the word \"of\" is very common in English, yet is the only word in which the letter \"f\" is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}.) As a result, nearly all speech synthesis systems use a combination of these approaches.\n\nLanguages with a [[phonemic orthography]] have a very regular writing system, and the prediction of the pronunciation of words based on their spellings is quite successful. Speech synthesis systems for such languages often use the rule-based method extensively, resorting to dictionaries only for those few words, like foreign names and [[Loanword|borrowings]], whose pronunciations are not obvious from their spellings. On the other hand, speech synthesis systems for languages like [[English language|English]], which have extremely irregular spelling systems, are more likely to rely on dictionaries, and to use rule-based methods only for unusual words, or words that aren't in their dictionaries.\n\n=== Evaluation challenges ===\nThe consistent evaluation of speech synthesis systems may be difficult because of a lack of universally agreed objective evaluation criteria. Different organizations often use different speech data. The quality of speech synthesis systems also depends on the quality of the production technique (which may involve analogue or digital recording) and on the facilities used to replay the speech. Evaluating speech synthesis systems has therefore often been compromised by differences between production techniques and replay facilities.\n\nSince 2005, however, some researchers have started to evaluate speech synthesis systems using a common speech dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://festvox.org/blizzard |title=Blizzard Challenge |publisher=Festvox.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Prosodics and emotional content ===\n{{See also|Prosody (linguistics)}}\nA study in the journal ''Speech Communication'' by Amy Drahota and colleagues at the [[University of Portsmouth]], [[UK]], reported that listeners to voice recordings could determine, at better than chance levels, whether or not the speaker was smiling.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Smile -and the world can hear you |date=January 9, 2008 |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title,74220,en.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517102201/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title%2C74220%2Cen.html |publisher=University of Portsmouth |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Smile \u2013 And The World Can Hear You, Even If You Hide |work=Science Daily |date=January 2008 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080111224745.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Drahota\n |first1      = A.\n |title       = The vocal communication of different kinds of smile\n |doi         = 10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001\n |journal     = Speech Communication\n |volume      = 50\n |issue       = 4\n |pages       = 278\u2013287\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062330/https://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |archivedate = 2013-07-03\n}}<!-- also available here: http://ganymedes.lib.unideb.hu:8080/udpeer/bitstream/2437.2/2984/1/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf --></ref> It was suggested that identification of the vocal features that signal emotional content may be used to help make synthesized speech sound more natural. One of the related issues is modification of the [[pitch contour]] of the sentence, depending upon whether it is an affirmative, interrogative or exclamatory sentence.

It included the [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256 Narrator]] speech synthesizer chip on a removable cartridge. The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.\n\n===SAM===\n[[File:C64 Software Automatic Mouth demo.flac|thumb|A demo of SAM on the C64]]\nAlso released in 1982, [[Software Automatic Mouth]] was the first commercial all-software voice synthesis program. It was later used as the basis for [[Macintalk]]. The program was available for non-Macintosh Apple computers (including the Apple II, and the Lisa), various Atari models and the Commodore 64. The Apple version preferred additional hardware that contained DACs, although it could instead use the computer's one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card was not present. The Atari made use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disabled interrupt requests and shut down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when the screen is on. The Commodore 64 made use of the 64's embedded SID audio chip.\n\n=== Atari ===\nArguably, the first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] was the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers designed by [[Atari, Inc.]] using the Votrax SC01 chip in 1983. The 1400XL/1450XL computers used a Finite State Machine to enable World English Spelling text-to-speech synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/computers/8bits/1400xlmodem.pdf |title=1400XL/1450XL Speech Handler External Reference Specification |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> Unfortunately, the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers never shipped in quantity.\n\nThe [[Atari ST]] computers were sold with \"stspeech.tos\" on floppy disk.\n\n=== Apple ===\n\nThe first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] that shipped in quantity was [[Apple Computer]]'s [[PlainTalk#Original MacInTalk|MacInTalk]]. The software was licensed from 3rd party developers Joseph Katz and Mark Barton (later, SoftVoice, Inc.) and was featured during the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh computer. This January demo required 512 kilobytes of RAM memory. As a result, it could not run in the 128 kilobytes of RAM the first Mac actually shipped with.<ref name=\"demo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Intro_Demo.txt |title=It Sure Is Great To Get Out Of That Bag! |publisher=folklore.org |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> So, the demo was accomplished with a prototype 512k Mac, although those in attendance were not told of this and the synthesis demo created considerable excitement for the Macintosh. In the early 1990s Apple expanded its capabilities offering system wide text-to-speech support. With the introduction of faster PowerPC-based computers they included higher quality voice sampling. Apple also introduced [[speech recognition]] into its systems which provided a fluid command set. More recently, Apple has added sample-based voices. Starting as a curiosity, the speech system of Apple [[Macintosh]] has evolved into a fully supported program, [[PlainTalk]], for people with vision problems. [[VoiceOver]] was for the first time featured in 2005 in [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4). During 10.4 (Tiger) and first releases of 10.5 ([[Mac OS X Leopard|Leopard]]) there was only one standard voice shipping with Mac OS X. Starting with 10.6 ([[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]), the user can choose out of a wide range list of multiple voices. VoiceOver voices feature the taking of realistic-sounding breaths between sentences, as well as improved clarity at high read rates over PlainTalk. Mac OS X also includes [[say (software)|say]], a [[Command-line interface|command-line based]] application that converts text to audible speech. The [[AppleScript]] Standard Additions includes a [[say (software)|say]] verb that allows a script to use any of the installed voices and to control the pitch, speaking rate and modulation of the spoken text.\n\nThe Apple [[iOS]] operating system used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch uses [[VoiceOver]] speech synthesis for accessibility.<ref name=\"configure\">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3577 |title=iPhone: Configuring accessibility features (Including VoiceOver and Zoom) |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some third party applications also provide speech synthesis to facilitate navigating, reading web pages or translating text.\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:Amiga speech synthesis.flac|thumb|Example of speech synthesis with the included Say utility in Workbench 1.3]]\n[[File:SoftVoice.svg|right|upright]]\nThe second operating system to feature advanced speech synthesis capabilities was [[AmigaOS]], introduced in 1985.

AmigaOS also featured a high-level \"[[AmigaOS#Speech synthesis|Speak Handler]]\", which allowed command-line users to redirect text output to speech. Speech synthesis was occasionally used in third-party programs, particularly word processors and educational software. The synthesis software remained largely unchanged from the first AmigaOS release and Commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from AmigaOS 2.1 onward.\n\nDespite the American English phoneme limitation, an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis was developed. This made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of languages, given a set of rules for each language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |title=Translator Library (Multilingual-speech version) |last1=Devitt |first1=Francesco |date=30 June 1995 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226143859/https://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Microsoft Windows ===\n{{See also|Microsoft Agent}}\n\nModern [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] desktop systems can use [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 1-4 API family|SAPI 4]] and [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 5 API family|SAPI 5]] components to support speech synthesis and [[speech recognition]].

Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by many TI-written video games (notable titles offered with speech during this promotion were [[Alpiner (video game)|Alpiner]] and [[Parsec (video game)|Parsec]]). The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit, which would increase the device's built-in vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge canceled that plan.\n\n==Text-to-speech systems==\n'''Text-to-Speech''' ('''TTS''') refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud.

The most recent is [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] (SSML), which became a [[W3C recommendation]] in 2004. Older speech synthesis markup languages include Java Speech Markup Language ([[JSML]]) and [[SABLE]]. Although each of these was proposed as a standard, none of them have been widely adopted.\n\nSpeech synthesis markup languages are distinguished from dialogue markup languages. [[VoiceXML]], for example, includes tags related to speech recognition, dialogue management and touchtone dialing, in addition to text-to-speech markup.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSpeech synthesis has long been a vital [[assistive technology]] tool and its application in this area is significant and widespread. It allows environmental barriers to be removed for people with a wide range of disabilities. The longest application has been in the use of [[screen reader]]s for people with [[visual impairment]], but text-to-speech systems are now commonly used by people with [[dyslexia]] and other reading difficulties as well as by pre-literate children. They are also frequently employed to aid those with severe [[speech impairment]] usually through a dedicated [[voice output communication aid]].\n\nSpeech synthesis techniques are also used in entertainment productions such as games and animations. In 2007, Animo Limited announced the development of a software application package based on its speech synthesis software FineSpeech, explicitly geared towards customers in the entertainment industries, able to generate narration and lines of dialogue according to user specifications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-02/speech-synthesis-software |title=Speech Synthesis Software for Anime Announced |work=Anime News Network |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> The application reached maturity in 2008, when NEC [[Biglobe]] announced a web service that allows users to create phrases from the voices of [[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2]] characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-09/code-geass-voice-synthesis-service-offered-in-japan |title=Code Geass Speech Synthesizer Service Offered in Japan |publisher=Animenewsnetwork.com |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Text to Speech for disability and handicapped communication aids have become widely deployed in Mass Transit. Text to Speech is also finding new applications outside the disability market. For example, speech synthesis, combined with [[speech recognition]], allows for interaction with mobile devices via [[natural language processing]] interfaces.\n\nText-to speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media.\n\nIn addition, speech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A [[voice quality]] synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at [[University of Bras\u00edlia|University of Brasilia]], simulates the physics of [[phonation]] and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries.<ref name=\":0\" />  The synthesizer has been used to mimic the [[timbre]] of [[dysphonic]] speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Hawking]] was one of the most famous people using a speech computer to communicate]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Chinese speech synthesis]]\n* [[Comparison of screen readers]]\n* [[Comparison of speech synthesizers]]\n* [[Euphonia (device)]]\n* [[Orca (assistive technology)]]\n* [[Paperless office]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Speech-generating device]]\n* [[Silent speech interface]]\n* [[Text to speech in digital television]]\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis/}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE6zy8aUwtQ Simulated singing with the singing robot Pavarobotti] or a description from the [[BBC]] on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqNM6Ccck8 how the robot synthesized the singing].\n\n\n{{sound synthesis types}}\n{{Speech synthesis}}\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speech Synthesis}}\n[[Category:Speech synthesis| ]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]]\n[[Category:Assistive technology]]\n[[Category:Auditory displays]]\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|Speech-generating device}}\n\n'''Speech synthesis''' is the artificial production of human [[speech]].

The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\n\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are ''concatenative synthesis'' and ''[[formant]] synthesis''. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\n\n=== Concatenation synthesis ===\n{{main|Concatenative synthesis}}\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the [[concatenation]] (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\n\n==== Unit selection synthesis ====\n\nUnit selection synthesis uses large [[database]]s of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual [[phone (phonetics)|phones]], [[diphone]]s, half-phones, [[syllable]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified [[speech recognition|speech recognizer]] set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the [[waveform]] and [[spectrogram]].<ref>[[Alan W. Black]], [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/papers/IEEE2002/allthetime/allthetime.html Perfect synthesis for all of the people all of the time.] IEEE TTS Workshop 2002.</ref> An [[index (database)|index]] of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the [[fundamental frequency]] ([[pitch (music)|pitch]]), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted [[decision tree]].\n\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the [[gigabyte]]s of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech.<ref>John Kominek and [[Alan W. Black]]. (2003). CMU ARCTIC databases for speech synthesis. CMU-LTI-03-177.

The number of diphones depends on the [[phonotactics]] of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of [[digital signal processing]] techniques such as [[linear predictive coding]], [[PSOLA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |title=Pitch-Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA) Synthesis |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222180903/http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref> or [[MBROLA]].<ref>T.

It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports.<ref>L.F. Lamel, J.L. Gauvain, B. Prouts, C. Bouhier, R. Boesch. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.6101&rep=rep1&type=pdf Generation and Synthesis of Broadcast Messages], ''Proceedings ESCA-NATO Workshop and Applications of Speech Technology'', September 1993.</ref>  The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] dialects of English the ''\"r\"'' in words like ''\"clear\"'' {{IPA|/\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259/}} is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. ''\"clear out\"'' is realized as {{IPA|/\u02cckl\u026a\u0259\u0279\u02c8\u028c\u028at/}}). Likewise in [[French language|French]], many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]. This [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]].\n\n=== Formant synthesis ===\n\n[[Formant]] synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using [[additive synthesis]] and an acoustic model ([[physical modelling synthesis]]).<ref>Dartmouth College: [http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html ''Music and Computers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608035309/http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html |date=2011-06-08 }}, 1993.</ref> Parameters such as [[fundamental frequency]], [[phonation|voicing]], and [[noise]] levels are varied over time to create a [[waveform]] of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called ''rules-based synthesis''; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components.\nMany systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a [[screen reader]]. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in [[embedded system]]s, where [[data storage device|memory]] and [[microprocessor]] power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]s can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\n\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the [[Texas Instruments]] toy [[Speak & Spell (game)|Speak & Spell]], and in the early 1980s [[Sega]] [[Video arcade|arcade]] machines<ref>Examples include [[Astro Blaster]], [[Space Fury]], and [[Star Trek (arcade game)|Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator]]</ref> and in many [[Atari, Inc.]] arcade games<ref>Examples include [[Star Wars (arcade game)|Star Wars]], [[Firefox (arcade game)|Firefox]], [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (arcade game)|Return of the Jedi]], [[Road Runner (video game)|Road Runner]], [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (arcade game)|The Empire Strikes Back]], [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]], [[720\u00b0]], [[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]], [[Gauntlet II]], [[A.P.B.

The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the mid-1970s by [[Philip Rubin]], Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at [[Bell Laboratories]] in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\n\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the [[NeXT]]-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the [[University of Calgary]], where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by [[Steve Jobs]] in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as [[gnuspeech]]. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\n\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronqui, traquea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cic.unb.br/~lucero/papers/768_Paper.pdf|title = Physics-based synthesis of disordered voices|last = Lucero|first = J.

===\n\n==== Formulation ====\nGiven an input text or some sequence of linguistic unit <math>Y</math>, the target speech <math>X</math> can be derived by \n\n<math>X=\\arg\\max P(X|Y, \\theta)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter.\n\nTypically, the input text will first be passed to an acoustic feature generator, \nthen the acoustic features are passed to the neural vocoder.\nFor the acoustic feature generator, the [[Loss function]] is typically L1 or L2 loss.\nThese loss functions put a constraint that the output acoustic feature distributions must be Gaussian or Laplacian.\nIn practice, since the human voice band ranges from approximately 300 to 4000 Hz, \nthe loss function will be designed to have more penality on this range:\n\n<math>loss=\\alpha loss_{human} + (1 - \\alpha) loss_{other}</math>\n\nwhere <math>loss_{human}</math> is the loss from human voice band and <math>\\alpha</math> is a scalar typically around 0.5.\nThe acoustic feature is typically [[Spectrogram]] or spectrogram in [[Mel scale]].\nThese features capture the time-frequency relation of speech signal and thus, \nit is sufficient to generate intelligent outputs with these acoustic features.\nThe [[Mel-frequency cepstrum]] feature used in the speech recognition task is not suitable for speech synthesis because it reduces too much information.\n\n==== Brief History ====\nIn September 2016, [[DeepMind]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499 WaveNet], a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. \nThis shows the community that deep learning-based models have the capability to model raw waveforms and perform well on generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or spectrograms in mel scale, \nor even from some preprocessed linguistic features. \nIn early 2017, [[Mila (research institute)]] proposed [https://mila.quebec/en/publication/char2wav-end-to-end-speech-synthesis/ char2wav], \na model to produce raw waveform in an end-to-end method. \nAlso, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135 Tacotron] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06588 VoiceLoop], respectively, \nto generate acoustic features directly from the input text.\nIn the later in the same year, Google proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884 Tacotron2] which combined the WaveNet vocoder with the revised Tacotron architecture to perform end-to-end speech synthesis.\nTacotron2 can generate high-quality speech approaching the human voice. \nSince then, end-to-end methods became the hottest research topic because many researchers around the world start to notice the power of the end-to-end speech synthesizer.\n\n==== Advantages and Disadvantages ====\n\nThe advantages of end-to-end methods are as follows:\n* Only need a single model to perform text analysis, acoustic modeling and audio synthesis, i.e. synthesizing speech directly from characters\n** Less feature engineering\n** Easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, e.g. speaker or language\n** Adaptation to new data is easier\n** More robust than multi-stage models because no component's error can compound\n* Powerful model capacity to capture the hidden internal structures of data\n* Capable to generate intelligible and natural speech\n* No need to maintain a large database, i.e. small footprint\n\nDespite there are many advantages mentioned, end-to-end methods still have many challenges to be solved:\n* Auto-regressive-based models suffer from slow inference problem\n* Output speech are not robust when data are not sufficient\n* Lack of controllability compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches\n* Tend to learn the flat prosody by averaging over training data\n* Tend to output smoothed acoustic features because the l1 or l2 loss is used\n\n==== Challenges ====\n\n- ''Slow inference problem''\n\nTo solve the slow inference problem, [[Microsoft]] research and [[Baidu]] research both proposed use non-auto-regressive models to make the inference process faster.\nThe [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263 FastSpeech] model proposed by Microsoft use Transformer architecture with a duration model to achieve the goal. \nBesides, the duration model which borrows from traditional methods makes the speech production more robust.\n\n- ''Robustness problem''\n\nResearchers found that the robustness problem is strongly related to the text alignment failures, \nand this drives many researchers to revise the attention mechanism which utilize the strong local relation and monotonic properties of speech. \n\n- ''Controllability problem''\n\nTo solve the controllability problem, many works about variational

''Flat prosody problem''\n\nGST-Tacotron can slightly alleviate the flat prosody problem, however, it still depends on the training data.\n\n- ''Smoothed acoustic output problem''\n\nTo generate more realistic acoustic features, GAN learning strategy can be applied.\n\nHowever, in practice, neural vocoder can generalize well even when the input features are more smooth than real data.\n\n==== Semi-supervised Learning ====\n\nCurrently, self-supervised learning gain a lot of attention because of better utilizing unlabelled data.\nResearch <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chung |first=Yu-An

|author-link= |eprint=1905.06791 |title=Almost Unsupervised Text to Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition |class=cs.CL |date=2019 }}</ref> shows that with the aid of self-supervised loss, the need of paired data decreases.\n\n==== Zero-shot Speaker Adaptation ====\n\nZero-shot speaker adaptation is promising because a single model can generate speech with various speaker styles and characteristic.\nIn June 2018, Google proposed to use pre-trained speaker verification model as speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Jia |first=Ye |author-link= |eprint=1806.04558 |title=Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref>.\nThe speaker encoder then becomes a part of the neural text-to-speech model and it can decide the style and characteristic of the output speech.\nThis shows the community that only using a single model to generate speech of multiple style is possible.\n\n==== Neural Vocoder ====\n\nNeural vocoder plays a important role in deep learning-based speech synthesis to generate high-quality speech from acoustic features.\nThe [[WaveNet]] model proposed in 2016 achieves great performance on speech quality.\nWavenet factorised the joint probability of a waveform <math>\\mathbf{x}=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\}</math> as a product of conditional probabilities as follows\n\n<math>p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1})</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter including many dilated convolution layers.\nTherefore, each audio sample <math>x_t</math> is therefore conditioned on the samples at all previous timesteps.\nHowever, the auto-regressive nature of WaveNet makes the inference process dramatically slow.\nTo solve the slow inference problem that comes from the auto-regressive characteristic of WaveNet model, \nParallel WaveNet<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=van den Oord |first=Aaron  |author-link= |eprint=1711.10433 |title=Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref> is proposed.\nParallel WaveNet is an inverse autoregressive flow-based model which is trained by knowledge distillation with a pre-trained teacher WaveNet model.\nSince inverse autoregressive flow-based model is non-auto-regressive when performing inference, the inference speed is faster than real-time.\nIn the meanwhile, [[Nvidia]] proposed a flow-based WaveGlow <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Prenger |first=Ryan |author-link= |eprint=1811.00002 |title=WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis |class=cs.SD |date=2018 }}</ref> model which can also generate speech with faster than real-time speed.\nHowever, despite the high inference speed, \nparallel WaveNet has the limitation of the need of a pre-trained WaveNet model and WaveGlow takes many weeks to converge with limited computing devices.\nThis issue is solved by Parallel WaveGAN <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Yamamoto |first=Ryuichi |author-link= |eprint=1910.11480 |title=Parallel WaveGAN: A fast waveform generation model based on generative adversarial networks with multi-resolution spectrogram |class=eess.AS |date=2019 }}</ref> which learns to produce speech by multi-resolution spectral loss and GANs learning strategy.\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Text normalization challenges ===\n\nThe process of normalizing text is rarely straightforward. Texts are full of [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s, [[number]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s that all require expansion into a phonetic representation. There are many spellings in English which are pronounced differently based on context. For example, \"My latest project is to learn how to better project my voice\" contains two pronunciations of \"project\".\n\nMost text-to-speech (TTS) systems do not generate [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantic]] representations of their input texts, as processes for doing so are unreliable, poorly understood, and computationally ineffective. As a result, various [[heuristic]] techniques are used to guess the proper way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s, like examining neighboring words and using statistics about frequency of occurrence.\n\nRecently TTS systems have begun to use HMMs (discussed above) to generate \"[[Part-of-speech tagging|parts of speech]]\" to aid in disambiguating homographs.  This technique is quite successful for many cases such as whether \"read\" should be pronounced as \"red\" implying past tense, or as \"reed\" implying present tense.  Typical error rates when using HMMs in this fashion are usually below five percent.  These techniques also work well for most European languages, although access to required training [[Text corpus|corpora]] is frequently difficult in these languages.\n\nDeciding how to convert numbers is another problem that TTS systems have to address. It is a simple programming challenge to convert a number into words (at least in English), like \"1325\" becoming \"one thousand three hundred twenty-five.\" However, numbers occur in many different contexts; \"1325\" may also be read as \"one three two five\", \"thirteen twenty-five\" or \"thirteen hundred and twenty five\". A TTS system can often infer how to expand a number based on surrounding words, numbers, and punctuation, and sometimes the system provides a way to specify the context if it is ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web | title = Speech synthesis | publisher = World Wide Web Organization | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.1.8}}</ref> Roman numerals can also be read differently depending on context.  For example, \"Henry VIII\" reads as \"Henry the Eighth\", while \"Chapter VIII\" reads as \"Chapter Eight\".\n\nSimilarly, abbreviations can be ambiguous. For example, the abbreviation \"in\" for \"inches\" must be differentiated from the word \"in\", and the address \"12 St John St.\" uses the same abbreviation for both \"Saint\" and \"Street\". TTS systems with intelligent front ends can make educated guesses about ambiguous abbreviations, while others provide the same result in all cases, resulting in nonsensical (and sometimes comical) outputs, such as \"[[Ulysses S. Grant]]\" being rendered as \"Ulysses South Grant\".\n\n=== Text-to-phoneme challenges ===\n\nSpeech synthesis systems use two basic approaches to determine the pronunciation of a word based on its [[spelling]], a process which is often called text-to-phoneme or [[grapheme]]-to-phoneme conversion ([[phoneme]] is the term used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] to describe distinctive sounds in a [[language]]). The simplest approach to text-to-phoneme conversion is the dictionary-based approach, where a large dictionary containing all the words of a language and their correct [[pronunciation]]s is stored by the program. Determining the correct pronunciation of each word is a matter of looking up each word in the dictionary and replacing the spelling with the pronunciation specified in the dictionary. The other approach is rule-based, in which pronunciation rules are applied to words to determine their pronunciations based on their spellings. This is similar to the \"sounding out\", or [[synthetic phonics]], approach to learning reading.\n\nEach approach has advantages and drawbacks. The dictionary-based approach is quick and accurate, but completely fails if it is given a word which is not in its dictionary. As dictionary size grows, so too does the memory space requirements of the synthesis system. On the other hand, the rule-based approach works on any input, but the complexity of the rules grows substantially as the system takes into account irregular spellings or pronunciations. (Consider that the word \"of\" is very common in English, yet is the only word in which the letter \"f\" is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}.) As a result, nearly all speech synthesis systems use a combination of these approaches.\n\nLanguages with a [[phonemic orthography]] have a very regular writing system, and the prediction of the pronunciation of words based on their spellings is quite successful. Speech synthesis systems for such languages often use the rule-based method extensively, resorting to dictionaries only for those few words, like foreign names and [[Loanword|borrowings]], whose pronunciations are not obvious from their spellings. On the other hand, speech synthesis systems for languages like [[English language|English]], which have extremely irregular spelling systems, are more likely to rely on dictionaries, and to use rule-based methods only for unusual words, or words that aren't in their dictionaries.\n\n=== Evaluation challenges ===\nThe consistent evaluation of speech synthesis systems may be difficult because of a lack of universally agreed objective evaluation criteria. Different organizations often use different speech data. The quality of speech synthesis systems also depends on the quality of the production technique (which may involve analogue or digital recording) and on the facilities used to replay the speech. Evaluating speech synthesis systems has therefore often been compromised by differences between production techniques and replay facilities.\n\nSince 2005, however, some researchers have started to evaluate speech synthesis systems using a common speech dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://festvox.org/blizzard |title=Blizzard Challenge |publisher=Festvox.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Prosodics and emotional content ===\n{{See also|Prosody (linguistics)}}\nA study in the journal ''Speech Communication'' by Amy Drahota and colleagues at the [[University of Portsmouth]], [[UK]], reported that listeners to voice recordings could determine, at better than chance levels, whether or not the speaker was smiling.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Smile -and the world can hear you |date=January 9, 2008 |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title,74220,en.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517102201/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title%2C74220%2Cen.html |publisher=University of Portsmouth |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Smile \u2013 And The World Can Hear You, Even If You Hide |work=Science Daily |date=January 2008 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080111224745.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Drahota\n |first1      = A.\n |title       = The vocal communication of different kinds of smile\n |doi         = 10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001\n |journal     = Speech Communication\n |volume      = 50\n |issue       = 4\n |pages       = 278\u2013287\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062330/https://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |archivedate = 2013-07-03\n}}<!-- also available here: http://ganymedes.lib.unideb.hu:8080/udpeer/bitstream/2437.2/2984/1/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf --></ref> It was suggested that identification of the vocal features that signal emotional content may be used to help make synthesized speech sound more natural. One of the related issues is modification of the [[pitch contour]] of the sentence, depending upon whether it is an affirmative, interrogative or exclamatory sentence.

It included the [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256 Narrator]] speech synthesizer chip on a removable cartridge. The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.\n\n===SAM===\n[[File:C64 Software Automatic Mouth demo.flac|thumb|A demo of SAM on the C64]]\nAlso released in 1982, [[Software Automatic Mouth]] was the first commercial all-software voice synthesis program. It was later used as the basis for [[Macintalk]]. The program was available for non-Macintosh Apple computers (including the Apple II, and the Lisa), various Atari models and the Commodore 64. The Apple version preferred additional hardware that contained DACs, although it could instead use the computer's one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card was not present. The Atari made use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disabled interrupt requests and shut down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when the screen is on. The Commodore 64 made use of the 64's embedded SID audio chip.\n\n=== Atari ===\nArguably, the first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] was the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers designed by [[Atari, Inc.]] using the Votrax SC01 chip in 1983. The 1400XL/1450XL computers used a Finite State Machine to enable World English Spelling text-to-speech synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/computers/8bits/1400xlmodem.pdf |title=1400XL/1450XL Speech Handler External Reference Specification |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> Unfortunately, the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers never shipped in quantity.\n\nThe [[Atari ST]] computers were sold with \"stspeech.tos\" on floppy disk.\n\n=== Apple ===\n\nThe first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] that shipped in quantity was [[Apple Computer]]'s [[PlainTalk#Original MacInTalk|MacInTalk]]. The software was licensed from 3rd party developers Joseph Katz and Mark Barton (later, SoftVoice, Inc.) and was featured during the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh computer. This January demo required 512 kilobytes of RAM memory. As a result, it could not run in the 128 kilobytes of RAM the first Mac actually shipped with.<ref name=\"demo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Intro_Demo.txt |title=It Sure Is Great To Get Out Of That Bag! |publisher=folklore.org |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> So, the demo was accomplished with a prototype 512k Mac, although those in attendance were not told of this and the synthesis demo created considerable excitement for the Macintosh. In the early 1990s Apple expanded its capabilities offering system wide text-to-speech support. With the introduction of faster PowerPC-based computers they included higher quality voice sampling. Apple also introduced [[speech recognition]] into its systems which provided a fluid command set. More recently, Apple has added sample-based voices. Starting as a curiosity, the speech system of Apple [[Macintosh]] has evolved into a fully supported program, [[PlainTalk]], for people with vision problems. [[VoiceOver]] was for the first time featured in 2005 in [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4). During 10.4 (Tiger) and first releases of 10.5 ([[Mac OS X Leopard|Leopard]]) there was only one standard voice shipping with Mac OS X. Starting with 10.6 ([[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]), the user can choose out of a wide range list of multiple voices. VoiceOver voices feature the taking of realistic-sounding breaths between sentences, as well as improved clarity at high read rates over PlainTalk. Mac OS X also includes [[say (software)|say]], a [[Command-line interface|command-line based]] application that converts text to audible speech. The [[AppleScript]] Standard Additions includes a [[say (software)|say]] verb that allows a script to use any of the installed voices and to control the pitch, speaking rate and modulation of the spoken text.\n\nThe Apple [[iOS]] operating system used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch uses [[VoiceOver]] speech synthesis for accessibility.<ref name=\"configure\">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3577 |title=iPhone: Configuring accessibility features (Including VoiceOver and Zoom) |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some third party applications also provide speech synthesis to facilitate navigating, reading web pages or translating text.\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:Amiga speech synthesis.flac|thumb|Example of speech synthesis with the included Say utility in Workbench 1.3]]\n[[File:SoftVoice.svg|right|upright]]\nThe second operating system to feature advanced speech synthesis capabilities was [[AmigaOS]], introduced in 1985. The voice synthesis was licensed by [[Commodore International]] from SoftVoice, Inc., who also developed the original MacinTalk text-to-speech system. It featured a complete system of voice emulation for American English, with both male and female voices and \"stress\" indicator markers, made possible through the [[Amiga]]'s audio [[chipset]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Miner, Jay |year=1991 |title=Amiga Hardware Reference Manual |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-201-56776-2|display-authors=etal|author-link=Jay Miner }}</ref> The synthesis system was divided into a translator library which converted unrestricted English text into a standard set of phonetic codes and a narrator device which implemented a formant model of speech generation.. AmigaOS also featured a high-level \"[[AmigaOS#Speech synthesis|Speak Handler]]\", which allowed command-line users to redirect text output to speech. Speech synthesis was occasionally used in third-party programs, particularly word processors and educational software. The synthesis software remained largely unchanged from the first AmigaOS release and Commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from AmigaOS 2.1 onward.\n\nDespite the American English phoneme limitation, an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis was developed. This made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of languages, given a set of rules for each language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |title=Translator Library (Multilingual-speech version) |last1=Devitt |first1=Francesco |date=30 June 1995 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226143859/https://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Microsoft Windows ===\n{{See also|Microsoft Agent}}\n\nModern [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] desktop systems can use [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 1-4 API family|SAPI 4]] and [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 5 API family|SAPI 5]] components to support speech synthesis and [[speech recognition]].

[[Windows 2000]] added [[Microsoft Narrator|Narrator]], a text-to-speech utility for people who have visual impairment. Third-party programs such as JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, Non-visual Desktop Access, Supernova and System Access can perform various text-to-speech tasks such as reading text aloud from a specified website, email account, text document, the Windows clipboard, the user's keyboard typing, etc. Not all programs can use speech synthesis directly.<ref name=\"Narrator\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/usingnarrator.aspx |title=Accessibility Tutorials for Windows XP: Using Narrator |publisher=Microsoft |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some programs can use plug-ins, extensions or add-ons to read text aloud.

Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by many TI-written video games (notable titles offered with speech during this promotion were [[Alpiner (video game)|Alpiner]] and [[Parsec (video game)|Parsec]]). The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit, which would increase the device's built-in vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge canceled that plan.\n\n==Text-to-speech systems==\n'''Text-to-Speech''' ('''TTS''') refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud. A '''TTS Engine''' converts written text to a phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound. TTS engines with different languages, dialects and specialized vocabularies are available through third-party publishers.<ref name=\"microsoft.com\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306902 |title=How to configure and use Text-to-Speech in Windows XP and in Windows Vista |publisher=Microsoft  |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Android ===\n\nVersion 1.6 of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] added support for speech synthesis (TTS).<ref>{{cite web |author = Jean-Michel Trivi |date=2009-09-23 |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/09/introduction-to-text-to-speech-in.html |title=An introduction to Text-To-Speech in Android |publisher=Android-developers.blogspot.com |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nCurrently, there are a number of [[application software|applications]], [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] and [[gadget]]s that can read messages directly from an [[e-mail client]] and web pages from a [[web browser]] or [[Google Toolbar]].

On one hand, online RSS-narrators simplify information delivery by allowing users to listen to their favourite news sources and to convert them to [[podcast]]s. On the other hand, on-line RSS-readers are available on almost any [[Personal computer|PC]] connected to the Internet. Users can download generated audio files to portable devices, e.g. with a help of [[podcast]] receiver, and listen to them while walking, jogging or commuting to work.\n\nA growing field in Internet based TTS is web-based [[assistive technology]], e.g. 'Browsealoud' from a UK company and [[Readspeaker]]. It can deliver TTS functionality to anyone (for reasons of accessibility, convenience, entertainment or information) with access to a web browser.

The most recent is [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] (SSML), which became a [[W3C recommendation]] in 2004. Older speech synthesis markup languages include Java Speech Markup Language ([[JSML]]) and [[SABLE]]. Although each of these was proposed as a standard, none of them have been widely adopted.\n\nSpeech synthesis markup languages are distinguished from dialogue markup languages. [[VoiceXML]], for example, includes tags related to speech recognition, dialogue management and touchtone dialing, in addition to text-to-speech markup.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSpeech synthesis has long been a vital [[assistive technology]] tool and its application in this area is significant and widespread. It allows environmental barriers to be removed for people with a wide range of disabilities. The longest application has been in the use of [[screen reader]]s for people with [[visual impairment]], but text-to-speech systems are now commonly used by people with [[dyslexia]] and other reading difficulties as well as by pre-literate children. They are also frequently employed to aid those with severe [[speech impairment]] usually through a dedicated [[voice output communication aid]].\n\nSpeech synthesis techniques are also used in entertainment productions such as games and animations. In 2007, Animo Limited announced the development of a software application package based on its speech synthesis software FineSpeech, explicitly geared towards customers in the entertainment industries, able to generate narration and lines of dialogue according to user specifications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-02/speech-synthesis-software |title=Speech Synthesis Software for Anime Announced |work=Anime News Network |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> The application reached maturity in 2008, when NEC [[Biglobe]] announced a web service that allows users to create phrases from the voices of [[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2]] characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-09/code-geass-voice-synthesis-service-offered-in-japan |title=Code Geass Speech Synthesizer Service Offered in Japan |publisher=Animenewsnetwork.com |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Text to Speech for disability and handicapped communication aids have become widely deployed in Mass Transit. Text to Speech is also finding new applications outside the disability market. For example, speech synthesis, combined with [[speech recognition]], allows for interaction with mobile devices via [[natural language processing]] interfaces.\n\nText-to speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media.\n\nIn addition, speech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A [[voice quality]] synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at [[University of Bras\u00edlia|University of Brasilia]], simulates the physics of [[phonation]] and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries.<ref name=\":0\" />  The synthesizer has been used to mimic the [[timbre]] of [[dysphonic]] speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Hawking]] was one of the most famous people using a speech computer to communicate]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Chinese speech synthesis]]\n* [[Comparison of screen readers]]\n* [[Comparison of speech synthesizers]]\n* [[Euphonia (device)]]\n* [[Orca (assistive technology)]]\n* [[Paperless office]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Speech-generating device]]\n* [[Silent speech interface]]\n* [[Text to speech in digital television]]\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis/}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE6zy8aUwtQ Simulated singing with the singing robot Pavarobotti] or a description from the [[BBC]] on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqNM6Ccck8 how the robot synthesized the singing].\n\n\n{{sound synthesis types}}\n{{Speech synthesis}}\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speech Synthesis}}\n[[Category:Speech synthesis| ]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]]\n[[Category:Assistive technology]]\n[[Category:Auditory displays]]\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]\n", "name_user": "2405:205:110e:d29d:f5e6:193c:ed53:841", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis"}

Not even time,\n:Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.\n:So that I might be sitting now beside my father\n:As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe\n:For the first time in the winter of 1959.\nIn his review of the collection, [[Joel Brouwer]] also quoted at length from this poem, writing that \"for Smith the abyss seems as much a space of possibility as of oblivion:\"<ref name=Brouwer />\n:Perhaps the great error is believing we\u2019re alone,\n:That the others have come and gone \u2014 a momentary blip \u2014\n:When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,\n:Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel\n:Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,\n:...\n[[Dan Chiasson]] writes of another aspect of the collection: \"The issues of power and paternalism suggest the deep ways in which this is a book about race. Smith\u2019s deadpan title is itself racially freighted: we can\u2019t think about one set of fifties images, of Martians and sci-fi comics, without conjuring another, of black kids in the segregated South. Those two image files are situated uncannily close to each other in the cultural cortex, but it took this book to connect them.\"<ref name=Chiasson />\n\nAbout ''The Body's Question'', [[Lucie Brock-Broido]] writes: \"How delightful it is to fall under the lucid and quite more than lovely spell of Tracy K. Smith's debut collection. Smith's work is deceptively plainspoken, but these are poems that are powerfully wrought, inspiring in all the clarity of their many gospel truths. ''The Body's Question'' announces a remarkable new voice, brilliantly bundled, ingeniously belted down.\"\n\n[[Yusef Komunyakaa]] writes: \"''The Body's Question'' is an answer to pure passion, but the beauty is that the brain isn't divorced from the body. The strength of character in these marvelous poems delights and questions. Here's a voice that can weave beauty and terror into one breath, and the unguarded revelations are never verbal striptease.\"\n\n\"Tracy Smith speaks many different languages. Besides the Spanish that graces the 'Gospels' of her book's opening section, Smith also seems perfectly at home speaking of grief and loss, of lust and hunger, of joy and desire, which here often means the desire for desire, and a desire for language itself....She seems to speak in tongues, to speak about that thing even beyond language, answering 'The Body's Question' of her title,\" said [[Kevin Young (poet)|Kevin Young]].\n\nAbout Smith's second book, ''Duende'', [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]] writes: \"Tracy K. Smith synthesizes the riches of many discursive and poetic traditions without regard to doctrine and with great technical rigor. Her poems are mysterious but utterly lucid and write a history that is sub-rosa yet fully within her vision. They are deeply satisfying and necessarily inconclusive. And they are pristinely beautiful without ever being precious. Writers and musicians have explored the concept of [[Duende (art)|duende]], which might in English translate to a kind of existential blues. Smith is not interested in sadness, per se. Rather, in the strange music of these poems I think Smith is trying to walk us close to the edge of death-in-life, the force of hovering death in both the personal and social realms, admitting its inevitability and sometimes-proximity, and understand its manifestations in quotidian acts. This dark force is nonetheless a life force, which, in the poem 'Flores Woman,' concludes 'Like a dark star. I want to last' If ''Duende'' were wine, it would certainly be red; if edible, it would be meat cooked rare, coffee taken black, stinky cheese, bittersweet chocolate. Tracy K. Smith's music is wholly her own, and ''Duende'' is a dolorous, beautiful book.\"\n\nSmith has received praise throughout her books for her questions on relationships, identity and sexuality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/magazine/poem-a-mans-world.html|title=Poem: A Man\u2019s World|last=Smith|first=Tracy K.|date=2018-11-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/books/review/leslie-jamison-sylvia-plath-joan-didion-jean-rhys.html|title=Cult of the Literary Sad Woman|last=Jamison|first=Leslie|date=2019-11-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Hilton Als]] of [[The New Yorker]] writes: \"Part of the gorgeous struggle in Smith\u2019s poetry is about how to understand and accept her twin selves: the black girl who was brought up to be a polite Christian and the woman who is willing to give herself over to unbridled sensation and desire.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/tracy-k-smiths-poetry-of-desire|title=Tracy K.

Not even time,\n:Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.\n:So that I might be sitting now beside my father\n:As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe\n:For the first time in the winter of 1959.\nIn his review of the collection, [[Joel Brouwer]] also quoted at length from this poem, writing that \"for Smith the abyss seems as much a space of possibility as of oblivion:\"<ref name=Brouwer />\n:Perhaps the great error is believing we\u2019re alone,\n:That the others have come and gone \u2014 a momentary blip \u2014\n:When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,\n:Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel\n:Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,\n:...\n[[Dan Chiasson]] writes of another aspect of the collection: \"The issues of power and paternalism suggest the deep ways in which this is a book about race. Smith\u2019s deadpan title is itself racially freighted: we can\u2019t think about one set of fifties images, of Martians and sci-fi comics, without conjuring another, of black kids in the segregated South. Those two image files are situated uncannily close to each other in the cultural cortex, but it took this book to connect them.\"<ref name=Chiasson />\n\nAbout ''The Body's Question'', [[Lucie Brock-Broido]] writes: \"How delightful it is to fall under the lucid and quite more than lovely spell of Tracy K. Smith's debut collection. Smith's work is deceptively plainspoken, but these are poems that are powerfully wrought, inspiring in all the clarity of their many gospel truths. ''The Body's Question'' announces a remarkable new voice, brilliantly bundled, ingeniously belted down.\"\n\n[[Yusef Komunyakaa]] writes: \"''The Body's Question'' is an answer to pure passion, but the beauty is that the brain isn't divorced from the body. The strength of character in these marvelous poems delights and questions. Here's a voice that can weave beauty and terror into one breath, and the unguarded revelations are never verbal striptease.\"\n\n\"Tracy Smith speaks many different languages. Besides the Spanish that graces the 'Gospels' of her book's opening section, Smith also seems perfectly at home speaking of grief and loss, of lust and hunger, of joy and desire, which here often means the desire for desire, and a desire for language itself....She seems to speak in tongues, to speak about that thing even beyond language, answering 'The Body's Question' of her title,\" said [[Kevin Young (poet)|Kevin Young]].\n\nAbout Smith's second book, ''Duende'', [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]] writes: \"Tracy K. Smith synthesizes the riches of many discursive and poetic traditions without regard to doctrine and with great technical rigor. Her poems are mysterious but utterly lucid and write a history that is sub-rosa yet fully within her vision. They are deeply satisfying and necessarily inconclusive. And they are pristinely beautiful without ever being precious. Writers and musicians have explored the concept of [[Duende (art)|duende]], which might in English translate to a kind of existential blues. Smith is not interested in sadness, per se. Rather, in the strange music of these poems I think Smith is trying to walk us close to the edge of death-in-life, the force of hovering death in both the personal and social realms, admitting its inevitability and sometimes-proximity, and understand its manifestations in quotidian acts.

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth.

Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature.

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<ref name=\"world-building\">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gillette |title=World-Building |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=978-0-89879-707-7|year=1996 }}</ref>\n\nOf the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon, while only 8 are based on silicon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html |title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon?

The [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance]] of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}</ref>\n\nEven so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide.

And those eyes opened and closed mechanically. After surveying the scene, it looked like we were in the ballpark with our costume idea to go glittery, silvery, and ethereal. These partygoers nailed it. We headed inside. At most clubs, people head to the smoking area so they can talk.

A fire took place on April 22, 2008 and forced a relocation.

These partygoers nailed it. We headed inside. At most clubs, people head to the smoking area so they can talk.

He became a [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen. By the early 1960s he was studying [[Shotokan]] [[karate]]-Do at the headquarters of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] at [[Nihon University]]. He spent 1967 to 1969 as a game warden in [[Ethiopia]], setting up the new [[Semien Mountains National Park]]. He returned to Japan, writing a book about his Ethiopian experiences entitled ''From the Roof of Africa'' (1971).\n\nSince taking up residence in Japan he wrote books and other literary works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television drama written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He continued to be an active [[environmentalist]] and lecture about the environment, addressing issues such as [[deforestation]] and the preservation of natural environments. He was particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast [[woodland]]s. The C. W. Nicol Afan Woodland in Kurohime, [[Shinano, Nagano|Shinano]]machi, Nagano Prefecture, was established in 1986.\n\nHe became a Japanese citizen (and thus lost his Canadian and British citizenship), which he wrote about in {{nihongo|''Why I became Japanese''|\u50d5\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u7406\u7531|Boku ga Nihonjin ni natta riy\u016b}}.\n\nHe wrote both fiction and non-fiction books, in both Japanese and in English. His subjects included [[whaling]] (for which he went on a trip on a whaling vessel), the environment, martial arts and children's fiction. His books have been translated between English and Japanese, as well as into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In 2005, he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nC. W. Nicol was the chairman of the Afan Woodland Trust.

He became a [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen. By the early 1960s he was studying [[Shotokan]] [[karate]]-Do at the headquarters of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] at [[Nihon University]]. He spent 1967 to 1969 as a game warden in [[Ethiopia]], setting up the new [[Semien Mountains National Park]]. He returned to Japan, writing a book about his Ethiopian experiences entitled ''From the Roof of Africa'' (1971).\n\nSince taking up residence in Japan he wrote books and other literary works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television drama written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He continued to be an active [[environmentalist]] and lecture about the environment, addressing issues such as [[deforestation]] and the preservation of natural environments. He was particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast [[woodland]]s. The C. W.

His subjects included [[whaling]] (for which he went on a trip on a whaling vessel), the environment, martial arts and children's fiction. His books have been translated between English and Japanese, as well as into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In 2005, he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nC. W. Nicol was the chairman of the Afan Woodland Trust.
