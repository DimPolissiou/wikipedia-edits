On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked. [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a \"demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights\", following users' agreement on their terms of service.

Upon his election, he appointed [[Silvestre Bello III]] as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, who considers making all companies put at least 80% of all employees under contract as per the president's orders. By the end of 2016, around 36000 workers have been regularized. Going into 2017, Duterte and Bello aimed for a new permanent policy that would end labor-only contractualization by the end of February, but Bello wound up not signing it. Instead he decided first for dialogue between the president and labor groups in order to get feedback. Eventually President Duterte met with the labor groups as Bello drafts a new Department Order that would stop labor contractualization. However, by March 16 Bello signs Department Order 174 which sets stricter guidelines on contractualization but doesn't immediately illegalize it. Duterte however continued his stand against contractualization, promising to sign an Executive Order against it. However, the Marawi crisis ends up postponing the signing. As of 2018, no Executive Order has been signed by President Duterte regarding the complete abolishment of contractualization. A rally was organized by labor groups on March 15, 2018 in protest against the president's delay of the EO. Eventually on May 1, Duterte signed an EO that would put an end to contractualization, although labor groups criticized the president for his actions since the one signed was not the draft agreed upon with them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomacruz |first1=Sofia |title=TIMELINE: Duterte's promise to abolish endo |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/201468-duterte-endo-contractualization-promise-2016-to-2018 |website=Rappler |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Land reform===\n{{Empty section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Law and order===\nOn June 13, 2018, the [[Philippine National Police]] launched \"Oplan RODY\" or \"Rid the Streets of Drunkards and Youths\".

Upon his election, he appointed [[Silvestre Bello III]] as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, who considers making all companies put at least 80% of all employees under contract as per the president's orders. By the end of 2016, around 36000 workers have been regularized. Going into 2017, Duterte and Bello aimed for a new permanent policy that would end labor-only contractualization by the end of February, but Bello wound up not signing it. Instead he decided first for dialogue between the president and labor groups in order to get feedback. Eventually President Duterte met with the labor groups as Bello drafts a new Department Order that would stop labor contractualization. However, by March 16 Bello signs Department Order 174 which sets stricter guidelines on contractualization but doesn't immediately illegalize it. Duterte however continued his stand against contractualization, promising to sign an Executive Order against it. However, the Marawi crisis ends up postponing the signing. As of 2018, no Executive Order has been signed by President Duterte regarding the complete abolishment of contractualization. A rally was organized by labor groups on March 15, 2018 in protest against the president's delay of the EO. Eventually on May 1, Duterte signed an EO that would put an end to contractualization, although labor groups criticized the president for his actions since the one signed was not the draft agreed upon with them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomacruz |first1=Sofia |title=TIMELINE: Duterte's promise to abolish endo |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/201468-duterte-endo-contractualization-promise-2016-to-2018 |website=Rappler |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Land reform===\n{{Empty section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Law and order===\nOn June 13, 2018, the [[Philippine National Police]] launched \"Oplan RODY\" or \"Rid the Streets of Drunkards and Youths\".

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nOnce again, Colchester finished high in the Fourth Division table, but ten points off [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Remarkably, the U's were paired against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in all three cup competitions they participated in, but only succeeded in beating them once, failing to defeat them in the first round of the League Cup and second round of the FA Cup, but won over two legs in the Associate Members' Cup.\n\n==Season overview==\nDespite chairman Maurice Cadman announcing the removal of win bonuses for the season, only three of the eight out-of-contract players chose to move on despite the new scheme. [[Steve Wignall]] however decided to leave for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].\n\nColchester were paired with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], where they were beaten 5\u20132 over two legs. The U's were then drawn against them in the second round of the [[FA Cup]] after seeing off [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the [[Essex derby]] following a replay. Again, Gillingham won, on this occasion scoring five in a single match and inflicting the heaviest ever home defeat on Colchester.\n\nIn-form [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[Tony Adcock]] continued his scoring form, with 28 goals to his name by January. However, with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] rumoured to be interested in signing him and [[Bobby Hunt (footballer, born 1942)|Bobby Hunt]]'s 38-goal record in sight, he suffered a serious knee injury which ruled him out for almost the remainder of the season.\n\nOnce more Colchester fell just short of promotion in seventh place, but ten points adrift of automatic promotion in fourth position. The club equalled its record away win with a 5\u20131 victory at [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 23 March.\n\nMeanwhile, Maurice Cadman found a new buyer for the club, with Jonathan Crisp paying the \u00a3150,000 asking price. He promised [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] football within five years, but in light of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] on 11 May, a move away from the timber-constructed [[Layer Road]] stands meant fabricating a move away or redevelopment of the stadium was of utmost importance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cu-fc.com/news/2012/july/the-1970s-and-1980s/ |title=The

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nOnce again, Colchester finished high in the Fourth Division table, but ten points off [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Remarkably, the U's were paired against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in all three cup competitions they participated in, but only succeeded in beating them once, failing to defeat them in the first round of the League Cup and second round of the FA Cup, but won over two legs in the Associate Members' Cup.\n\n==Season overview==\nDespite chairman Maurice Cadman announcing the removal of win bonuses for the season, only three of the eight out-of-contract players chose to move on despite the new scheme. [[Steve Wignall]] however decided to leave for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].\n\nColchester were paired with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], where they were beaten 5\u20132 over two legs. The U's were then drawn against them in the second round of the [[FA Cup]] after seeing off [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the [[Essex derby]] following a replay. Again, Gillingham won, on this occasion scoring five in a single match and inflicting the heaviest ever home defeat on Colchester.\n\nIn-form [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[Tony Adcock]] continued his scoring form, with 28 goals to his name by January. However, with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] rumoured to be interested in signing him and [[Bobby Hunt (footballer, born 1942)|Bobby Hunt]]'s 38-goal record in sight, he suffered a serious knee injury which ruled him out for almost the remainder of the season.\n\nOnce more Colchester fell just short of promotion in seventh place, but ten points adrift of automatic promotion in fourth position. The club equalled its record away win with a 5\u20131 victory at [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 23 March.\n\nMeanwhile, Maurice Cadman found a new buyer for the club, with Jonathan Crisp paying the \u00a3150,000 asking price. He promised [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] football within five years, but in light of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] on 11 May, a move away from the timber-constructed [[Layer Road]] stands meant fabricating a move away or redevelopment of the stadium was of utmost importance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cu-fc.com/news/2012/july/the-1970s-and-1980s/ |title=The

The General Alberts Primary School in Alberton is also named after him.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://gnlalberts.wixsite.com/albies/our-history-ons-geskiedenis |website=General Alberts Primary School |accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background and youth ==\nAlberts was the oldest son of Hendrik Abraham Alberts and Martha Magdalena Claassen of [[Heidelberg, Western Cape]]. He grew up on his father's farm, but little is known of his education other than that he was home-schooled by his mother at least sometimes. Later briefs and war correspondence show a high level of literacy.\n\nAfter marrying 17-year-old Petronella Johanna Oosthuizen of Ladismith when he was 19, they moved to near the other Heidelberg in [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) and settled near Heidelberg, where he would become a wealthy farmer by the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]].\n\n== Second Boer War ==\nWith the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899, he enlisted in the Heidelberg commandos and was deployed to the [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] front.\n\nHe participated in a number of battles, including the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] (January 24, 1900), in which he served as acting [[field cornet]]. After the occupation of [[Pretoria]] by [[British Army]] troops in June 1900, he retreated with the Heidelberg commandos to [[Machadodorp]], where he served as [[commandant]] in place of Cmdt. Cornelis Johannes Spruyt, who had been promoted to [[general officer|general]]. He continued to serve in Spruyt's place when needed, such as when the latter and Gen. [[Louis Botha]] fought Gen. [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] at the Battle of [[Lake Chrissie]] (February 6, 1901). When Gen. Spruyt was killed in action in July 1901, Alberts was promoted in his stead.\n\nHe became Gen. Botha's right-hand man in East Transvaal, such as in the [[Battle of Bakenlaagte]] on October 30, 1901, where they defeated Lt. Col. George Elliot Benson. Alberts was then deployed with several Transvaal commandos to the [[Orange Free State]], fighting over a wide area in tandem with Gen. [[Christiaan de Wet]]. At the Battle of Kalkkrans, in February 1902, he and the other [[Boer Republic]] forces were routed by the British lines, and he therefore had to join Gen. De Wet on a retreat into the [[Drakensberg]].\n\nAfterwards, he returned to East Transvaal to harass British supply lines, in order to relieve pressure on Gen. Botha's forces. In May 1902, he was at the signing ceremony of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]], where he spoke in favor of accepting the British peace proposal. When the commandos laid down their arms on June 5, 1902, at Kraal Station, he handed a letter of thanks to his officers.\n\n== Postwar ==\nAfter the war, Alberts returned to work on his farm, but he needed to rebuild his house and barn from scratch. In time, thanks to several profitable [[real estate]] transactions, he restored his finances. He remained a fervent supporter of Gen. Botha and an active participant in local politics, including the foundation of the [[Het Volk (political party)|Het Volk]] Party in the C.N.O. School in Transvaal. Alberts also led a syndicate that purchased the ground where the city of Alberton, bearing his name, would one day stand.\n\nIn 1905, he began to experience the [[heart disease]] that would soon end his life. A.P.J. van Rensburg wrote of him in the ''[[Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek]]'': \"fatherlander par excellence, deeply pious, friendly, and approachable, he won a lasting place among the heroes of South Africa.\" He was survived by three biological sons, two biological daughters, and an [[Adoption|adopted]] son.\n\n== Albert's Farm ==\nIn the 1890s, according to tradition, Alberts leased 114 acres of the old farm of [[Waterval]] to its owner. The original homestead is long gone, but the fenced family graveyard remains. In 1946, Albert's descendants sold 45,000 m\u00b2 for \u00a318,500 to the city council for public use.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://greymont.co.za/alberts-farm/ History of Albert's Farm].

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nColchester finished sixth in the league table come the end of the season, but were nine points distant of promoted [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in fourth place. The U's were knocked out of the FA Cup by [[Non-League football|non-League]] opposition in [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the first round, and exited the League Cup in the first round to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Despite a win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the Associate Members' Cup, Colchester were defeated by [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] who progressed from the group stages to the knockout phase of the competition.\n\nThree weeks prior to the end of the season, [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Cyril Lea]] was sacked and replaced by former U's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]].\n\n==Season overview==\nFollowing regulation changes in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] and the [[Bradford City stadium fire]], [[Layer Road]] was facing \u00a3500,000 of safety improvements to bring the ground up to standards. With the club ailing financially, sections of the ground were closed, reducing capacity to 4,900.\n\n[[Manager (association football)|Manager]] [[Cyril Lea]] continued a trend of recruiting former [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] by bringing in [[Forward (association football)|forwards]] [[Robin Turner]] and [[Trevor Whymark]] during the season.\n\nIn October, the club were top of the table, but after suffering six successive league defeats, four without scoring, the club slid down the table and crashed out of the [[FA Cup]] to [[Non-League football|non-League]] [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. They had already made an early exit to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and would soon follow suit in the [[EFL Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nLea struggled to find a strike partner for [[Tony Adcock]] following a car crash that ended [[Keith Bowen]]'s playing career. The side were otherwise free scoring, and despite a good record, Lea was sacked three weeks ahead of the end of the campaign and replaced by Reserve team coach [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]]. Walker, initially in a [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] capacity, took the U's on an unbeaten run for their final eight games of the season, winning five. This left the club in sixth position in the table, nine points shy of promotion.\n\nThe season was notable for [[hat-trick]]s, with [[Perry Groves]] twice achieving the feat against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and brothers [[Tommy English (footballer)|Tommy]] and [[Tony English]] scoring hat-tricks within five days of one another. The brothers were also both [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in April, a game which Colchester won 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nColchester finished sixth in the league table come the end of the season, but were nine points distant of promoted [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in fourth place. The U's were knocked out of the FA Cup by [[Non-League football|non-League]] opposition in [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the first round, and exited the League Cup in the first round to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Despite a win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the Associate Members' Cup, Colchester were defeated by [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] who progressed from the group stages to the knockout phase of the competition.\n\nThree weeks prior to the end of the season, [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Cyril Lea]] was sacked and replaced by former U's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]].\n\n==Season overview==\nFollowing regulation changes in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] and the [[Bradford City stadium fire]], [[Layer Road]] was facing \u00a3500,000 of safety improvements to bring the ground up to standards. With the club ailing financially, sections of the ground were closed, reducing capacity to 4,900.\n\n[[Manager (association football)|Manager]] [[Cyril Lea]] continued a trend of recruiting former [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] by bringing in [[Forward (association football)|forwards]] [[Robin Turner]] and [[Trevor Whymark]] during the season.\n\nIn October, the club were top of the table, but after suffering six successive league defeats, four without scoring, the club slid down the table and crashed out of the [[FA Cup]] to [[Non-League football|non-League]] [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. They had already made an early exit to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and would soon follow suit in the [[EFL Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nLea struggled to find a strike partner for [[Tony Adcock]] following a car crash that ended [[Keith Bowen]]'s playing career. The side were otherwise free scoring, and despite a good record, Lea was sacked three weeks ahead of the end of the campaign and replaced by Reserve team coach [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]]. Walker, initially in a [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] capacity, took the U's on an unbeaten run for their final eight games of the season, winning five. This left the club in sixth position in the table, nine points shy of promotion.\n\nThe season was notable for [[hat-trick]]s, with [[Perry Groves]] twice achieving the feat against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and brothers [[Tommy English (footballer)|Tommy]] and [[Tony English]] scoring hat-tricks within five days of one another. The brothers were also both [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in April, a game which Colchester won 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nThe [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] were introduced in 1987 for clubs finishing in fourth, fifth and sixth positions. United ended the campaign in fifth place, ten points adrift of automatic promotion. They faced fourth placed [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the semi-final, but were eliminated following a 2\u20130 defeat in the first leg and a 0\u20130 draw at [[Molineux Stadium]] in the second leg.\n\nColchester were eliminated from the FA Cup by eventual play-off winners [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in the second round, and were defeated by [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] respectively in the League Cup and Associate Members' Cup.\n\n==Season overview==\n[[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]] was appointed as permanent manager after finishing the previous campaign in a [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] capacity.\n\nEarly in the season, [[Perry Groves]] was sold to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for \u00a350,000, but despite this Colchester were [[bookmaker]]s favourites heading into the new term. Seven successive away defeats from December denied the U's this opportunity as they came home in fifth position, ten points shy of promoted Essex rivals [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. However, with the introduction of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] in 1987, Colchester had an opportunity to achieve promotion. They faced fourth-placed [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at a rain-soaked [[Layer Road]] in their semi-final first leg tie in front of a near-capacity 4,829. The visitors came away with a 2\u20130 victory, and a 0\u20130 draw at [[Molineux Stadium]] in the second leg meant Colchester would remain in the Fourth Division for at least another year.\n\nColchester did not fare well in cup competition once again, with an early exit in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] to [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in the first round. They needed a replay against [[Non-League football|non-League]] [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] in the [[FA Cup]] to reach the second round, but were defeated 3\u20132 at [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in the second round. The U's progressed from the preliminary round of the [[EFL Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]] to face [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the southern section first round, but were beaten 2\u20130 at

Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]].\n\nThe [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] were introduced in 1987 for clubs finishing in fourth, fifth and sixth positions. United ended the campaign in fifth place, ten points adrift of automatic promotion. They faced fourth placed [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the semi-final, but were eliminated following a 2\u20130 defeat in the first leg and a 0\u20130 draw at [[Molineux Stadium]] in the second leg.\n\nColchester were eliminated from the FA Cup by eventual play-off winners [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in the second round, and were defeated by [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] respectively in the League Cup and Associate Members' Cup.\n\n==Season overview==\n[[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]] was appointed as permanent manager after finishing the previous campaign in a [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] capacity.\n\nEarly in the season, [[Perry Groves]] was sold to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for \u00a350,000, but despite this Colchester were [[bookmaker]]s favourites heading into the new term. Seven successive away defeats from December denied the U's this opportunity as they came home in fifth position, ten points shy of promoted Essex rivals [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. However, with the introduction of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] in 1987, Colchester had an opportunity to achieve promotion. They faced fourth-placed [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at a rain-soaked [[Layer Road]] in their semi-final first leg tie in front of a near-capacity 4,829. The visitors came away with a 2\u20130 victory, and a 0\u20130 draw at [[Molineux Stadium]] in the second leg meant Colchester would remain in the Fourth Division for at least another year.\n\nColchester did not fare well in cup competition once again, with an early exit in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] to [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in the first round. They needed a replay against [[Non-League football|non-League]] [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] in the [[FA Cup]] to reach the second round, but were defeated 3\u20132 at [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in the second round. The U's progressed from the preliminary round of the [[EFL Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]] to face [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the southern section first round, but were beaten 2\u20130 at [[Priestfield Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cu-fc.com/news/2012/july/the-1970s-and-1980s/ |title=The 1970s and 1980s |last=Hudson |first=Matt |date=11 July 2012 |publisher=Colchester
