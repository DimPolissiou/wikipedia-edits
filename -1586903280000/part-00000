In its early years the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of [[Neil H. Jacoby]] as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the U.S. for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees.  Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered.\n\nIn 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration.  Five years later it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school\u2019s name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management.\n\nIn 1987, [[John E. Anderson]] (1917\u20132011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA\u2019s campus. He later donated additional $25 million. The 6-building, {{convert|285000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility, was designed by [[Henry N. Cobb]] of the architectural firm [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] and Executive Architects [[Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Associates]]. It cost $75 million to construct and opened officially in 1995. \n\nOn May 13, 2015, Marion Anderson, widow of the late John Anderson, announced a $100 million donation (4th single-largest donation to a business school in the United States) to the school for fellowships and research, along with $40 million earmarked for initiating development of what is now known as the Marion Anderson Hall.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.anderson.ucla.edu/anderson/2017/10/marion-anderson-hall-a-link-to-the-past-a-bridge-to-the-future.html|title=Marion Anderson Hall: A Link to the Past, a Bridge to the Future|website=UCLA Anderson School of Management Blog|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref> \n\nRecently, the school has been mostly self-funded, with only $6 million of government funding out of its $96 million budget in 2010-11.<ref name=\"insidehighered\">''Pushback on a B-School's Bold Plan'', Inside Higher Ed., November 23, 2010, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/23/ucla URL]</ref> In fall 2010, the school proposed \"financial self-sufficiency\": Giving up all state funding, in return for freedom from some state rules and freedom to raise tuition.<ref name=\"insidehighered\" /> Critics called this proposal \"privatization\", but the school rejected this description, with former Dean Judy Olian saying, \"This is not privatization....

Many notable scientists with an interest in ageing are either past or current members of the organisation, which has exerted a marked influence on ageing research within the United Kingdom and internationally.\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== Rationale ===\n\nAccording to the earliest rules of the British Society for Research on Ageing (1954):\n\n{{quote|the society is instituted for the purpose of advancing knowledge of the causes and processes of ageing, by clinical and other observations on human beings, or by related experimental studies on living organisms.}}\n\nHowever, in 1956 the Annual General Meeting of the society revised the rules such that:\n\n{{quote|the object of the Society shall be, through research, to increase knowledge of the processes and causes of ageing and, as indicated, of means for counteracting these both in human beings and in other organisms}}\n\nSince 1979 the objectives of the society have been as follows:\n\n# through research, to increase knowledge of the processes, causes and effects of ageing, and, as indicated, of means for counteracting these, both in human beings and in other organisms\n# to publish the results of all such research\n# to further public education therein\n\nThus, the Society seeks to improve understanding of the fundamental biology of ageing, as well as to educate the public regarding the scientific developments taking place in the field of modern gerontology. More recently the society has begun to directly fund research into the biology of ageing, including funding of \u00a354,750 to the end of a three-year PhD studentship at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bsra.org.uk/supporters/|title=Supporters - BSRA|work=BSRA|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific Meetings ===\n\nThe society currently organises at an annual scientific meeting<ref name=\"bsra.org.uk\"/>   and contributes to the activities of other organisations with similar goals on an ad hoc basic.

Good relations also exist with the ''[[Chemistry Central Journal]]'', which accepts work specifically relevant to the chemistry of ageing. In the past the society has maintained official journal status with ''[[Mechanisms of Ageing and Development]]'' and sponsored the creation of ''[[Age and Ageing]]'' jointly with the [[British Geriatrics Society]].  It no longer retains links with these latter journals.\n\n=== Election to membership ===\n\nMembership of the BSRA is open to those engaged in, directing, or interested in research to increase knowledge of the processes, causes and effects of ageing, both in human beings and in other organisms.  Typical candidates for membership are either qualified to doctoral level in a relevant scientific subject or working towards such a qualification (e.g. a PhD student).  However, the executive committee will assess each case on its merits and appropriate experiential or professional learning may be substituted.\n\nA candidate for membership must be proposed and seconded by two existing members, but should an application be made in the absence of such sponsors the executive committee may choose to act in their place.  This is intended to ensure that no worthy applicant is rejected due to a lack of prior contact with the disciplinary community.\n\n=== Life membership ===\n\nLife membership is both the oldest and highest honour that the British society for research on ageing can bestow.  It dates back to the very beginnings of the Society and was first awarded to its founder, Vladimir Korenchevsky (1880\u20131959) shortly before his death. Prior to 2011, only a four such awards had been made in the history of the BSRA, the last of these in 1966 to the pioneering gerontologist Professor Fritz Verzar (1886\u20131979). To qualify as an honorary life member, a nominee must be approved by at least nine-tenths of BSRA members.\n\nThe original award of honorary life membership was accompanied by a gift (the sum of one guinea per member of the executive committee). To retain this tradition honorary life members today receive a special silver badge. Conceived by Richard Faragher and noted jewellery designer Clara Vichi, the badge incorporates a stylised shell motif and the initials of the British Society for Research on Ageing. Vichi has achieved widespread recognition for designs of this type, which draw inspiration from calligraphy and typography. \nThe choice of a shell as the symbol of life membership combines insights from modern gerontology with the symbolism of medieval pilgrim badges. It is at once a reference to Arctica islandica (the longest-living non-colonial animal) and to the scallop shells worn by medieval pilgrims. To the original pilgrims the radial ridges on the shells they wore represented the different routes pilgrims travelled, eventually converging on their shared destination. Similarly, the membership of the BSRA study the biology of ageing in very different ways but share the common goal of creating a longer, healthier human lifespan.\n\n=== Lord Cohen of Birkenhead medal ===\n\nEstablished in 1979 and first awarded in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Lord Cohen Medal for Services to Gerontology|journal=Age and Ageing|volume=10|issue=3|year=1981|pages=200\u2013201|issn=0002-0729|doi=10.1093/ageing/10.3.200|pmid=7023208}}</ref> The Lord Cohen Medal honours a person who in the view of the Medal Committee has made a considerable contribution to ageing research, either through original discoveries or in the promotion of the subject of gerontology in its broadest aspects. The recipient is invited to give a keynote lecture to the Society\nNomination for the award can be made to the Committee by any member of the Society. The nominations must state the name, address and qualifications of the nominee, and should include sufficient information to allow the members of the Lord Cohen Medal Committee to assess the value of the contribution to ageing research. Current members of the executive committee are ineligible.\n\n=== Korenchevsky award ===\n\nThe Korenchevsky Award is made to a society member who has made an original contribution to ageing research of sufficient significance for the society to sponsor wider dissemination of these findings among the scientific community. The award holder is chosen on a competitive basis from among the oral presentations made be society members at the scientific meeting (including joint meetings) of the society. The criteria for the award are the scientific significance of the work and the aptitude of delivery displayed by the candidate.\n\nThe recipient receives a cash prize (currently \u00a31500) to be used to attend a suitable scientific meeting to present their work, promote the Objects of the Society and (in recognition of the tireless work of Korenchevsky in this arena) to facilitate international collaboration on ageing.\n\nThe current venue of choice is the Annual Meeting of the American Aging Association<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 AGE Program Speakers and Posters Abstracts|url=http://www.americanaging.org/2011/2011%20AGE%20Program%20-%20Speakers%20and%20Posters%20w%20Abstracts.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813102822/http://www.americanaging.org/2011/2011%20AGE%20Program%20-%20Speakers%20and%20Posters%20w%20Abstracts.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}</ref> but the applicant may select another meeting subject to the host organisation giving proper recognition to the BSRA and prior ratification the executive committee.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\n[[File:V. Korenchevsky 07-1935.jpg|thumb|100px|Korenchevsky, 1935]]\nThe British society for research on ageing began as the \"Club for Research on Ageing\" formed by Professor Vladimir Korenchevsky (1880\u20131959). Korenchevsky trained as a clinician in the Tzarist Medical Academy at Petrograd and, after serving as head of a military laboratory during the Russo-Japanese war, undertook postgraduate work with both lya Ilyich Mechnikov (1908) and Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1910\u201311). By 1915 he held the position of Professor of Experimental Pathology at the University of Petrograd but emigrated to Britain after he was removed from his chair by the Soviet government in 1920. He conducted research at the Lister Institute for Preventative Medicine in London from that time until 1945. Upon his retirement he founded the Nuffield Unit for Gerontological Research in Oxford where he worked until 1953. His primary research interest during his working life was the synthesis and action of sex hormones, an interest shared by several prominent members of the club for ageing in its early days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=K|title=Vladimir Korenchevsky. 30th January 1880\u20149th July|journal=Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology|year=1960|volume=80|pages=451\u2013461|doi=10.1002/path.1700800238|pmid=13710786}}</ref>\n\nThe precise date at which the \"Club for Research on Ageing\" was founded remains obscure but appears to predate Korenchevsky's visit to America in July 1939. It thus has a valid claim to be the oldest scientific society devoted to research into the biology of ageing in the world.  It is certainly the one which achieved the most significant global results in terms of influence and dissemination.\n\nWhilst in the USA he met with Vincent Cowdrey and a group of like-minded American researchers who had just completed the multi-author textbook \"Problems of Ageing: Biological and Medical Aspects\".  On Korenchevsky\u2019s recommendation approximately twenty of these researchers formed \u2018\u2018the American Division\u2019\u2019 of the Club for Research on Ageing. The first meeting of the \"American Branch\" of the Club for Ageing took place in early 1940 (early club members included Ross Harrison, Robert A. Moore and Edward J. Stieglitz). Evidence both for the continuing activities of the \"British branch\" of the club for ageing and for its continued contact with the American division is evidenced in the extant correspondence of Walter Bradford Cannon  (1871\u20131945) the distinguished Harvard physiologist and in that of the great British biologist Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (1890\u20131962) . In February 1942, Fisher was supplied by Korenchevsky with both a research proposal authored by Edward Stieglitz (probably the same document mentioned by Canon in correspondence dating from 1941) and a report on the importance of research into the biology of ageing. He collaborated with Korenchevsky during the war years and appears to have been a member of the club at that time (he attended a \"guiding group\" meeting on 10 September 1943 and appears to have had voting rights). From Fisher\u2019s correspondence it is also clear that Korenchevsky had interested Lord Nuffield in actively supporting gerontological research by 1942<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=HW|title=Edmund Vincent Cowdry and the Making of Gerontology as a Multidisciplinary Scientific Field in the United States|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=529\u2013572|doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9152-1|pmid=19244722|year=2008}}</ref>\nThe first formal conference of the \"British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing\" was held at Imperial College, London on 16 July 1946<ref name=\"korenchevsky468\">{{cite journal|last=Korenchevsky|first=V|title=Conditions desirable for the rapid progress of gerontological research|journal=British Journal of Medicine|year=1946|volume=2|issue=4473|page=468|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4473.468|pmid=20786942|pmc=2054398}}</ref> by which time, in addition to that in the USA, branches of the club had been established in Denmark, France, Sweden and Switzerland. In his address Korenchevsky told the conference:\n\n{{quote|the very great difficulty of the problem of ageing must be strongly emphasized. It is as difficult as, or perhaps more difficult than, the splitting of the atom, provided that the aim of gerontology is fully faced. This aim is not only a longer life but a stronger one-'to add life to years, not just years to life'}}\n\nThe resolution voted by the delegates at the conference of the British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing is also extant and remains true today:\n\n\"For the rapid advance of gerontology and geriatrics the following conditions are desirable: (1) Co-operative research work of scientists and medical research workers in civilised countries. (2) Large funds for financing this research. (3) The establishment of experimental and clinical Institutes for Research on Ageing in major countries. (4) The formation of groups of research workers in gerontology and geriatrics. (5) Large long-term grants to existing scientific and medical laboratories and research hospitals who will agree to start gerontological or geriatrical research work.\"<ref name=\"korenchevsky468\"/>\n\n=== Late 1940s\u20131960 ===\n\nThe chronology of the society between 1946 and 1954 is currently somewhat fragmentary. In 1945 the Research Club on Ageing (American division) became the Gerontological Society (of America) and in 1950, Korenchevsky and Cowdrey, together with Professor L. Brull, formed the International Association of Gerontology (IAG, now The International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics) which held its first Congress in Liege, Belgium on 10\u201312 July 1950.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\">{{cite book|last=III|first=Nathan W.

These were written at a time when the society was entering into a period of expansion but picture it (i) as active in the immediate past and (ii) active from a much earlier period (possibly pre-1939 since the Society is described as \"instrumental in the establishment of gerontological societies in European and American countries\").  The earliest extant List of Members and Rules of the Society available to the Society today dates from 1954<ref>{{cite book|title=British Society for Research on Ageing List of Members and Rules of the Society 3rd Edition|year=1957|publisher=Oxonian Press|location=Queen Street Oxford}}</ref>\nBased on internal document series and the number of members listed this was probably printed after October 1954 but before the close of the year (the executive committee meeting at which the new members were admitted taking place on 15 October). The combined List of Members and Rules of the Society is listed as the 3rd Edition which (assuming the annual or semi-annual printing that is normal practice for lists of society members) is consistent with a (now regrettably lost) 1st Edition probably printed 1950\u20131952.\n\nThis tallies closely with the chronology in Korenchevsky's BMJ article of 1952 as well as to his reference to an active executive committee for the BSRA in 1950 where it was funded by Lord Nuffield to participate in a round-table conference with the \"American delegation to the First International Gerontological Congress\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Korenchevsky|first=V.|title=Gerontology in the United Kingdom (Addendum)|journal=Journal of Gerontology|date=1 July 1952|volume=7|issue=3|pages=504|doi=10.1093/geronj/7.3.504|pmid=12981258}}</ref> This took place on 8 July 1950 under Lord Nuffield's chairmanship (preceding the IAG meeting by two days). This appears to be one of the earliest extant uses of the term \"British Society for Research on Ageing\" as opposed to the \"British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing\" and therefore represents a watershed date.\n\nThere are also references to the establishment of the Society in 1947 (e.g. Age and Ageing (1972) 1(1):2 and Korenchevsky's own correspondence to Cowdry).  There is also a reference to the \"Scottish Branch of the British Society for Research on Ageing\" which Korenchevsky described in 1951 as \"established and organised by Prof. Crew [Professor F.A.E Crew of Edinburgh University] in 1947 to stimulate and unite gerontologic and geriatric activities in Scotland\".\n\nUnder the circumstances, the decision was taken in 2010 by the chair of the BSRA to set the official date of the 1st BSRA annual general meeting (as opposed to its foundation date) as 1950 for meeting numeration purposes.  This corresponds to the foundation of the IAG and the ultimate cessation of the International Club for Research on Ageing. It is also consistent with Korenchevsky's statement of 1951 that the BSRA \"has organised its own annual conferences\". Thus, the 2010 annual scientific meeting of the British Society for Research on Ageing was the 60th annual general meeting.\n\nDuring this period support for the society was forthcoming from the Nuffield Foundation (established in 1943).\n\nKorenchevsky's report as Secretary(1 June 1954) to the society's four-man executive committee (chaired by Sir Charles Dodds FRS) showed that the BSRA had a notional 40 members paying an annual fee of 10s (equivalent to \u00a312 in 2014) and assets of approximately \u00a3680 (equivalent to ~\u00a315,800). By October 1954 this risen to 58, including possibly the BSRA's first foreign member (Professor J. Musso Fournier of Motevideo, Uruguay). A new Executive was elected for 1955 which included Professor Peter Medawar, who was to win a Nobel Prize shortly thereafter. The society restricted its interests to biological gerontology in contrast to both the IAG and the American geological Society. This was very much in accord with Korenchevsky's vision of how the organisation would operate and was to have significant consequences for the future development of the organisation.\n\nThe society's minutes during this period show a society dealing with the perennial problems in biological gerontology. These were (1) the limited number of scientists and clinicians interested in membership of \"the only society engaged in research on basic problems of gerontology\". (2) the question of whether or not to become practically involved in fundraising to conduct research into the biology of ageing. (3) how best to disseminate the scientific discoveries of members in the field of the biology of ageing and (4) how to work with societies with roughly cognate interests, either gerontological societies with broader disciplinary membership or with scientific societies (e.g. the nutrition Society) whose membership worked on problems directly relevant to the biology of ageing. How the executive committee chose to address these problems may be discerned from the summary below.\n\nAt this time, the BSRA did not hold a single scientific meeting which ran over several days (the standard format of many scientific conferences today). Instead, the preference was for short but frequent meetings held up to 4 times each year. In this respect, the society more closely resembled an organisation such as The Antibody Club which formed in 1960 (now part of the British society for immunology as the London immunology group, and which still organises seminars throughout the year) than many modern learned societies. The executive committee interspersed these short (in some cases only two hours) scientific meetings with co-ordinated activity with other interested organisations (e.g. with the Dutch gerontological Society, with the IAG and with open meetings at such as the one held on \"The Biology of Hair Growth\" held at the Royal College of Surgeons). Many routine secretarial functions were handled by the Institute of biology, of which the society remains a member today.\n\nBy 1958, the executive committee had decided that \"the time was not right to launch public campaigns for funds\". However, attempts to secure sustained funding for ageing research continued throughout the society's history.\n\nThe question of how best to disseminate the scientific findings of members was complicated by both the way in which the society operated and the variety of offers it received. As early as 1955, the organisation had considered sponsoring the European Journal of gerontology (probably analogous to the Journal of gerontology founded in 1946 shortly after the American branch of the club for ageing had become the GSA) but had decided not to do so. An invitation from Fritz Vezar and Karger that Gerontologica (now Gerontology) should become the official Journal of the BSRA was turned down in 1959, shortly after the Journal had been founded. The primary reason why neither formation of the society journal de novo or official linkage with a newly formed Journal was adopted seems to have been that the BSRA had formed a successful (and long lasting) linkage with the Ciba foundation. In early 1952 Prof RE Tunbridge (elected a member of the BSRA executive committee in 1954) had asked the Foundation if it was willing to hold a related conference on ageing close to the time of the third Congress of the IAG (July 1954). Not only did the Director of the foundation agree to this, but the Trustees took the decision in early 1954 \"to embark on special measures in support, internationally, of basic research relevant to the problems of ageing so that the conference already arranged became the first in what it is to be hoped will be a series of conferences on subjects in this field\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1955\">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=eds. for the Ciba Foundation: G.E.W. Wolstenholme ... [et|title=General Aspects|year=1955|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=9780470722350}}</ref> The Foundation launched a published series called \"Colloquia on Ageing\". The first of these (published 1955 on general aspects of ageing) was chaired by Prof Tunbridge and included contributions (either as speakers or discussants) from many prominent members of the BSRA including Medawar, Comfort, Olbers, and Krohn.  Prominent international scientists with connections to the BSRA and the IAGB also attended (e.g. Cowdry, Vezar and Brull)as did American researchers connected to the GSA such as Nathan Shock and McCay.\n\nCiba meetings had a distinct style in which \"leading research workers from different countries and different disciplines are invited to attend the colloquia. The size of the group is, however, very strictly limited in order to obtain a free conversational manner of discussion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1955\"/>  Close linkage with Ciba was thus a sensible decision for the executive committee because it both suited the style of meeting which the small membership of the BSRA preferred and provided a route for authoritative dissemination since \"the smallness of the groups [at the meeting] means the exclusion of many workers active and interested in the subjects discussed and therefore the proceedings of these conferences are published and made available throughout the world\". However, the disadvantage of this approach was that it was unsuited to the regular dissemination of peer-reviewed research that is so necessary today.\n\nAlthough the colloquia series proper seem to have been discontinued after five years<ref>{{cite book|title=The lifespan of animals|year=1959|publisher=J. & A. Churchill|location=London|isbn=9780470715253 |editor-last=Wolstenholme |editor-first=G.E.W. |editor-last2=O'Connor |editor-first2=Maeve |editor3=Ciba Foundation}}</ref> from 1955 to 1970 the executive committee of the society met at the Ciba Foundation (41 Portland Place, London).  Since the foundation headquarters also provided a library and guest facilities for visiting scientists this was to prove a remarkably durable and successful arrangement.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\n\nScientific meetings were regularly organised there and an annual Ciba lecture on ageing delivered at various locations throughout the UK until 1970 (the last probably by Leonard Hayflick). The society also undertook joint meetings with other organisations which had shared goals (e.g. with the Society for Experimental Biology in 1967) and its activities were always conducted with a view to harmonising them with the meetings of the IAG (which took place in Denmark, the USA, the USSR, Israel and Japan over this period) .  The disengagement of Ciba from support for ageing research in the early 1970s led to a number of distinct meeting venues being used by the executive committee (including the Royal College of Pathologists, St Pancras Hospital and the Leeds General infirmary).\n\nA particularly important point during this period was Age Action Year.  This was a concerted campaign to raise awareness of both the problems faced by older people and the potential of research into the mechanisms of ageing to alleviate them.  As Hugh Faulkner, founder of [[Help the Aged]], put it in a 1976 editorial:<ref name=\"Faulkner1976\">{{cite news |last1=Faulkner |first1=Hugh |title=Our Aim Must Be To Add Life To Years Not Just Years To Life|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/3rd-december-1976/8/our-aim-must-be-to-add-life-to-years-not-just-year |date=December 3, 1976 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323223931/http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/3rd-december-1976/8/our-aim-must-be-to-add-life-to-years-not-just-year |archivedate=March 23, 2014|publisher=[[The Catholic Herald]]}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Age Action Year will also see the provision of a foundation for co-ordinated research into ageing itself. This opens up exciting possibilities for everyone, because if we are to make old age a time of interest and healthy activity we have to know how to make people fit into later years, how to make the best use of available resources and how to gear our living throughout our lives so that we know how to make the best of our own 'bonus years'.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Britain badly needs this foundation, because although we are ahead of so many countries in the field of geriatric medicine, we do lag behind in not having a foundation to co-ordinate and direct various fields of research.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The research envisaged will tackle memory loss and [[senile dementia]], which affects 27 per cent of those over 85; it will tackle [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], which is both distressing and humiliating; [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], which is the cause of many heart attacks and strokes; [[retirement]], with its problems and opportunities, and other social matters.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The foundation will mean that every one of us can look to a more hopeful future. This new foundation which has such potential will require a lot of money, and it was this which prompted Sir Lindsay Ring (Lord Mayor of London till last month) to make Age Action Year his special appeal and put into it all his energy and enthusiasm.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>This was infectious, and the money has been coming in: first from individuals whose contributions are still required, then from companies and trusts, and recently a significant move has come from the trade union movement. Jack Jones challenged members of his own union and others to donate one penny a week from their wages.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>People in Britain have become more aware than ever before of the needs of the elderly. They have also seen that these needs can be met on the two fronts pioneered by Age Action Year. First, at the local level, so much can be done for the elderly among us. Secondly, at the research level: and we can all contribute to the setting up of the new foundation.</blockquote>\n\nThe BSRA had worked exceptionally hard to promote the Foundation which was originally known as the British Foundation for Ageing Research (or BFAR) but which was to become the respected charity Research Into Ageing.

Many notable scientists with an interest in ageing are either past or current members of the organisation, which has exerted a marked influence on ageing research within the United Kingdom and internationally.\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== Rationale ===\n\nAccording to the earliest rules of the British Society for Research on Ageing (1954):\n\n{{quote|the society is instituted for the purpose of advancing knowledge of the causes and processes of ageing, by clinical and other observations on human beings, or by related experimental studies on living organisms.}}\n\nHowever, in 1956 the Annual General Meeting of the society revised the rules such that:\n\n{{quote|the object of the Society shall be, through research, to increase knowledge of the processes and causes of ageing and, as indicated, of means for counteracting these both in human beings and in other organisms}}\n\nSince 1979 the objectives of the society have been as follows:\n\n# through research, to increase knowledge of the processes, causes and effects of ageing, and, as indicated, of means for counteracting these, both in human beings and in other organisms\n# to publish the results of all such research\n# to further public education therein\n\nThus, the Society seeks to improve understanding of the fundamental biology of ageing, as well as to educate the public regarding the scientific developments taking place in the field of modern gerontology. More recently the society has begun to directly fund research into the biology of ageing, including funding of \u00a354,750 to the end of a three-year PhD studentship at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bsra.org.uk/supporters/|title=Supporters - BSRA|work=BSRA|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific Meetings ===\n\nThe society currently organises at an annual scientific meeting<ref name=\"bsra.org.uk\"/>   and contributes to the activities of other organisations with similar goals on an ad hoc basic.

Good relations also exist with the ''[[Chemistry Central Journal]]'', which accepts work specifically relevant to the chemistry of ageing. In the past the society has maintained official journal status with ''[[Mechanisms of Ageing and Development]]'' and sponsored the creation of ''[[Age and Ageing]]'' jointly with the [[British Geriatrics Society]].  It no longer retains links with these latter journals.\n\n=== Election to membership ===\n\nMembership of the BSRA is open to those engaged in, directing, or interested in research to increase knowledge of the processes, causes and effects of ageing, both in human beings and in other organisms.  Typical candidates for membership are either qualified to doctoral level in a relevant scientific subject or working towards such a qualification (e.g. a PhD student).  However, the executive committee will assess each case on its merits and appropriate experiential or professional learning may be substituted.\n\nA candidate for membership must be proposed and seconded by two existing members, but should an application be made in the absence of such sponsors the executive committee may choose to act in their place.  This is intended to ensure that no worthy applicant is rejected due to a lack of prior contact with the disciplinary community.\n\n=== Life membership ===\n\nLife membership is both the oldest and highest honour that the British society for research on ageing can bestow.  It dates back to the very beginnings of the Society and was first awarded to its founder, Vladimir Korenchevsky (1880\u20131959) shortly before his death. Prior to 2011, only a four such awards had been made in the history of the BSRA, the last of these in 1966 to the pioneering gerontologist Professor Fritz Verzar (1886\u20131979). To qualify as an honorary life member, a nominee must be approved by at least nine-tenths of BSRA members.\n\nThe original award of honorary life membership was accompanied by a gift (the sum of one guinea per member of the executive committee). To retain this tradition honorary life members today receive a special silver badge. Conceived by Richard Faragher and noted jewellery designer Clara Vichi, the badge incorporates a stylised shell motif and the initials of the British Society for Research on Ageing. Vichi has achieved widespread recognition for designs of this type, which draw inspiration from calligraphy and typography. \nThe choice of a shell as the symbol of life membership combines insights from modern gerontology with the symbolism of medieval pilgrim badges. It is at once a reference to Arctica islandica (the longest-living non-colonial animal) and to the scallop shells worn by medieval pilgrims. To the original pilgrims the radial ridges on the shells they wore represented the different routes pilgrims travelled, eventually converging on their shared destination. Similarly, the membership of the BSRA study the biology of ageing in very different ways but share the common goal of creating a longer, healthier human lifespan.\n\n=== Lord Cohen of Birkenhead medal ===\n\nEstablished in 1979 and first awarded in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Lord Cohen Medal for Services to Gerontology|journal=Age and Ageing|volume=10|issue=3|year=1981|pages=200\u2013201|issn=0002-0729|doi=10.1093/ageing/10.3.200|pmid=7023208}}</ref> The Lord Cohen Medal honours a person who in the view of the Medal Committee has made a considerable contribution to ageing research, either through original discoveries or in the promotion of the subject of gerontology in its broadest aspects. The recipient is invited to give a keynote lecture to the Society\nNomination for the award can be made to the Committee by any member of the Society. The nominations must state the name, address and qualifications of the nominee, and should include sufficient information to allow the members of the Lord Cohen Medal Committee to assess the value of the contribution to ageing research. Current members of the executive committee are ineligible.\n\n=== Korenchevsky award ===\n\nThe Korenchevsky Award is made to a society member who has made an original contribution to ageing research of sufficient significance for the society to sponsor wider dissemination of these findings among the scientific community. The award holder is chosen on a competitive basis from among the oral presentations made be society members at the scientific meeting (including joint meetings) of the society. The criteria for the award are the scientific significance of the work and the aptitude of delivery displayed by the candidate.\n\nThe recipient receives a cash prize (currently \u00a31500) to be used to attend a suitable scientific meeting to present their work, promote the Objects of the Society and (in recognition of the tireless work of Korenchevsky in this arena) to facilitate international collaboration on ageing.\n\nThe current venue of choice is the Annual Meeting of the American Aging Association<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 AGE Program Speakers and Posters Abstracts|url=http://www.americanaging.org/2011/2011%20AGE%20Program%20-%20Speakers%20and%20Posters%20w%20Abstracts.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813102822/http://www.americanaging.org/2011/2011%20AGE%20Program%20-%20Speakers%20and%20Posters%20w%20Abstracts.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}</ref> but the applicant may select another meeting subject to the host organisation giving proper recognition to the BSRA and prior ratification the executive committee.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\n[[File:V. Korenchevsky 07-1935.jpg|thumb|100px|Korenchevsky, 1935]]\nThe British society for research on ageing began as the \"Club for Research on Ageing\" formed by Professor Vladimir Korenchevsky (1880\u20131959). Korenchevsky trained as a clinician in the Tzarist Medical Academy at Petrograd and, after serving as head of a military laboratory during the Russo-Japanese war, undertook postgraduate work with both lya Ilyich Mechnikov (1908) and Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1910\u201311). By 1915 he held the position of Professor of Experimental Pathology at the University of Petrograd but emigrated to Britain after he was removed from his chair by the Soviet government in 1920. He conducted research at the Lister Institute for Preventative Medicine in London from that time until 1945. Upon his retirement he founded the Nuffield Unit for Gerontological Research in Oxford where he worked until 1953. His primary research interest during his working life was the synthesis and action of sex hormones, an interest shared by several prominent members of the club for ageing in its early days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=K|title=Vladimir Korenchevsky. 30th January 1880\u20149th July|journal=Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology|year=1960|volume=80|pages=451\u2013461|doi=10.1002/path.1700800238|pmid=13710786}}</ref>\n\nThe precise date at which the \"Club for Research on Ageing\" was founded remains obscure but appears to predate Korenchevsky's visit to America in July 1939. It thus has a valid claim to be the oldest scientific society devoted to research into the biology of ageing in the world.  It is certainly the one which achieved the most significant global results in terms of influence and dissemination.\n\nWhilst in the USA he met with Vincent Cowdrey and a group of like-minded American researchers who had just completed the multi-author textbook \"Problems of Ageing: Biological and Medical Aspects\".  On Korenchevsky\u2019s recommendation approximately twenty of these researchers formed \u2018\u2018the American Division\u2019\u2019 of the Club for Research on Ageing. The first meeting of the \"American Branch\" of the Club for Ageing took place in early 1940 (early club members included Ross Harrison, Robert A. Moore and Edward J. Stieglitz). Evidence both for the continuing activities of the \"British branch\" of the club for ageing and for its continued contact with the American division is evidenced in the extant correspondence of Walter Bradford Cannon  (1871\u20131945) the distinguished Harvard physiologist and in that of the great British biologist Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (1890\u20131962) . In February 1942, Fisher was supplied by Korenchevsky with both a research proposal authored by Edward Stieglitz (probably the same document mentioned by Canon in correspondence dating from 1941) and a report on the importance of research into the biology of ageing. He collaborated with Korenchevsky during the war years and appears to have been a member of the club at that time (he attended a \"guiding group\" meeting on 10 September 1943 and appears to have had voting rights). From Fisher\u2019s correspondence it is also clear that Korenchevsky had interested Lord Nuffield in actively supporting gerontological research by 1942<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=HW|title=Edmund Vincent Cowdry and the Making of Gerontology as a Multidisciplinary Scientific Field in the United States|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=529\u2013572|doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9152-1|pmid=19244722|year=2008}}</ref>\nThe first formal conference of the \"British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing\" was held at Imperial College, London on 16 July 1946<ref name=\"korenchevsky468\">{{cite journal|last=Korenchevsky|first=V|title=Conditions desirable for the rapid progress of gerontological research|journal=British Journal of Medicine|year=1946|volume=2|issue=4473|page=468|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4473.468|pmid=20786942|pmc=2054398}}</ref> by which time, in addition to that in the USA, branches of the club had been established in Denmark, France, Sweden and Switzerland. In his address Korenchevsky told the conference:\n\n{{quote|the very great difficulty of the problem of ageing must be strongly emphasized. It is as difficult as, or perhaps more difficult than, the splitting of the atom, provided that the aim of gerontology is fully faced. This aim is not only a longer life but a stronger one-'to add life to years, not just years to life'}}\n\nThe resolution voted by the delegates at the conference of the British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing is also extant and remains true today:\n\n\"For the rapid advance of gerontology and geriatrics the following conditions are desirable: (1) Co-operative research work of scientists and medical research workers in civilised countries. (2) Large funds for financing this research. (3) The establishment of experimental and clinical Institutes for Research on Ageing in major countries.

In 1945 the Research Club on Ageing (American division) became the Gerontological Society (of America) and in 1950, Korenchevsky and Cowdrey, together with Professor L. Brull, formed the International Association of Gerontology (IAG, now The International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics) which held its first Congress in Liege, Belgium on 10\u201312 July 1950.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\">{{cite book|last=III|first=Nathan W.

In 1950, for several good reasons, the club was superseded by the International Gerontological Association.\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Korenchevsky|first=V|title=The International Association of Gerontology and rapid progress of gerontology|journal=British Journal of Medicine|year=1952|volume=1|issue=4754|pages=375\u20136|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4754.375|pmid=14896156|pmc=2022540}}</ref>\nContiguous internal minutes for the British Society for Research on Ageing (BSRA) are only currently available from June 1954 onwards. These were written at a time when the society was entering into a period of expansion but picture it (i) as active in the immediate past and (ii) active from a much earlier period (possibly pre-1939 since the Society is described as \"instrumental in the establishment of gerontological societies in European and American countries\").  The earliest extant List of Members and Rules of the Society available to the Society today dates from 1954<ref>{{cite book|title=British Society for Research on Ageing List of Members and Rules of the Society 3rd Edition|year=1957|publisher=Oxonian Press|location=Queen Street Oxford}}</ref>\nBased on internal document series and the number of members listed this was probably printed after October 1954 but before the close of the year (the executive committee meeting at which the new members were admitted taking place on 15 October). The combined List of Members and Rules of the Society is listed as the 3rd Edition which (assuming the annual or semi-annual printing that is normal practice for lists of society members) is consistent with a (now regrettably lost) 1st Edition probably printed 1950\u20131952.\n\nThis tallies closely with the chronology in Korenchevsky's BMJ article of 1952 as well as to his reference to an active executive committee for the BSRA in 1950 where it was funded by Lord Nuffield to participate in a round-table conference with the \"American delegation to the First International Gerontological Congress\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Korenchevsky|first=V.|title=Gerontology in the United Kingdom (Addendum)|journal=Journal of Gerontology|date=1 July 1952|volume=7|issue=3|pages=504|doi=10.1093/geronj/7.3.504|pmid=12981258}}</ref> This took place on 8 July 1950 under Lord Nuffield's chairmanship (preceding the IAG meeting by two days). This appears to be one of the earliest extant uses of the term \"British Society for Research on Ageing\" as opposed to the \"British Branch of the Club for Research on Ageing\" and therefore represents a watershed date.\n\nThere are also references to the establishment of the Society in 1947 (e.g. Age and Ageing (1972) 1(1):2 and Korenchevsky's own correspondence to Cowdry).  There is also a reference to the \"Scottish Branch of the British Society for Research on Ageing\" which Korenchevsky described in 1951 as \"established and organised by Prof. Crew [Professor F.A.E Crew of Edinburgh University] in 1947 to stimulate and unite gerontologic and geriatric activities in Scotland\".\n\nUnder the circumstances, the decision was taken in 2010 by the chair of the BSRA to set the official date of the 1st BSRA annual general meeting (as opposed to its foundation date) as 1950 for meeting numeration purposes.  This corresponds to the foundation of the IAG and the ultimate cessation of the International Club for Research on Ageing. It is also consistent with Korenchevsky's statement of 1951 that the BSRA \"has organised its own annual conferences\". Thus, the 2010 annual scientific meeting of the British Society for Research on Ageing was the 60th annual general meeting.\n\nDuring this period support for the society was forthcoming from the Nuffield Foundation (established in 1943).\n\nKorenchevsky's report as Secretary(1 June 1954) to the society's four-man executive committee (chaired by Sir Charles Dodds FRS) showed that the BSRA had a notional 40 members paying an annual fee of 10s (equivalent to \u00a312 in 2014) and assets of approximately \u00a3680 (equivalent to ~\u00a315,800). By October 1954 this risen to 58, including possibly the BSRA's first foreign member (Professor J. Musso Fournier of Motevideo, Uruguay). A new Executive was elected for 1955 which included Professor Peter Medawar, who was to win a Nobel Prize shortly thereafter. The society restricted its interests to biological gerontology in contrast to both the IAG and the American geological Society. This was very much in accord with Korenchevsky's vision of how the organisation would operate and was to have significant consequences for the future development of the organisation.\n\nThe society's minutes during this period show a society dealing with the perennial problems in biological gerontology. These were (1) the limited number of scientists and clinicians interested in membership of \"the only society engaged in research on basic problems of gerontology\". (2) the question of whether or not to become practically involved in fundraising to conduct research into the biology of ageing. (3) how best to disseminate the scientific discoveries of members in the field of the biology of ageing and (4) how to work with societies with roughly cognate interests, either gerontological societies with broader disciplinary membership or with scientific societies (e.g. the nutrition Society) whose membership worked on problems directly relevant to the biology of ageing. How the executive committee chose to address these problems may be discerned from the summary below.\n\nAt this time, the BSRA did not hold a single scientific meeting which ran over several days (the standard format of many scientific conferences today). Instead, the preference was for short but frequent meetings held up to 4 times each year. In this respect, the society more closely resembled an organisation such as The Antibody Club which formed in 1960 (now part of the British society for immunology as the London immunology group, and which still organises seminars throughout the year) than many modern learned societies. The executive committee interspersed these short (in some cases only two hours) scientific meetings with co-ordinated activity with other interested organisations (e.g. with the Dutch gerontological Society, with the IAG and with open meetings at such as the one held on \"The Biology of Hair Growth\" held at the Royal College of Surgeons). Many routine secretarial functions were handled by the Institute of biology, of which the society remains a member today.\n\nBy 1958, the executive committee had decided that \"the time was not right to launch public campaigns for funds\". However, attempts to secure sustained funding for ageing research continued throughout the society's history.\n\nThe question of how best to disseminate the scientific findings of members was complicated by both the way in which the society operated and the variety of offers it received. As early as 1955, the organisation had considered sponsoring the European Journal of gerontology (probably analogous to the Journal of gerontology founded in 1946 shortly after the American branch of the club for ageing had become the GSA) but had decided not to do so. An invitation from Fritz Vezar and Karger that Gerontologica (now Gerontology) should become the official Journal of the BSRA was turned down in 1959, shortly after the Journal had been founded. The primary reason why neither formation of the society journal de novo or official linkage with a newly formed Journal was adopted seems to have been that the BSRA had formed a successful (and long lasting) linkage with the Ciba foundation. In early 1952 Prof RE Tunbridge (elected a member of the BSRA executive committee in 1954) had asked the Foundation if it was willing to hold a related conference on ageing close to the time of the third Congress of the IAG (July 1954). Not only did the Director of the foundation agree to this, but the Trustees took the decision in early 1954 \"to embark on special measures in support, internationally, of basic research relevant to the problems of ageing so that the conference already arranged became the first in what it is to be hoped will be a series of conferences on subjects in this field\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1955\">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=eds. for the Ciba Foundation: G.E.W. Wolstenholme ... [et|title=General Aspects|year=1955|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=9780470722350}}</ref> The Foundation launched a published series called \"Colloquia on Ageing\". The first of these (published 1955 on general aspects of ageing) was chaired by Prof Tunbridge and included contributions (either as speakers or discussants) from many prominent members of the BSRA including Medawar, Comfort, Olbers, and Krohn.  Prominent international scientists with connections to the BSRA and the IAGB also attended (e.g. Cowdry, Vezar and Brull)as did American researchers connected to the GSA such as Nathan Shock and McCay.\n\nCiba meetings had a distinct style in which \"leading research workers from different countries and different disciplines are invited to attend the colloquia. The size of the group is, however, very strictly limited in order to obtain a free conversational manner of discussion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1955\"/>  Close linkage with Ciba was thus a sensible decision for the executive committee because it both suited the style of meeting which the small membership of the BSRA preferred and provided a route for authoritative dissemination since \"the smallness of the groups [at the meeting] means the exclusion of many workers active and interested in the subjects discussed and therefore the proceedings of these conferences are published and made available throughout the world\". However, the disadvantage of this approach was that it was unsuited to the regular dissemination of peer-reviewed research that is so necessary today.\n\nAlthough the colloquia series proper seem to have been discontinued after five years<ref>{{cite book|title=The lifespan of animals|year=1959|publisher=J. & A. Churchill|location=London|isbn=9780470715253 |editor-last=Wolstenholme |editor-first=G.E.W. |editor-last2=O'Connor |editor-first2=Maeve |editor3=Ciba Foundation}}</ref> from 1955 to 1970 the executive committee of the society met at the Ciba Foundation (41 Portland Place, London).  Since the foundation headquarters also provided a library and guest facilities for visiting scientists this was to prove a remarkably durable and successful arrangement.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\n\nScientific meetings were regularly organised there and an annual Ciba lecture on ageing delivered at various locations throughout the UK until 1970 (the last probably by Leonard Hayflick). The society also undertook joint meetings with other organisations which had shared goals (e.g. with the Society for Experimental Biology in 1967) and its activities were always conducted with a view to harmonising them with the meetings of the IAG (which took place in Denmark, the USA, the USSR, Israel and Japan over this period) .  The disengagement of Ciba from support for ageing research in the early 1970s led to a number of distinct meeting venues being used by the executive committee (including the Royal College of Pathologists, St Pancras Hospital and the Leeds General infirmary).\n\nA particularly important point during this period was Age Action Year.  This was a concerted campaign to raise awareness of both the problems faced by older people and the potential of research into the mechanisms of ageing to alleviate them.  As one newspaper{{which|date=March 2014}} put it:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/3rd-december-1976/8/our-aim-must-be-to-add-life-to-years-not-just-year |title=Our Aim Must Be To Add Life To Years Not Just Years To Life \u2013 from the Catholic Herald Archive |publisher=Archive.catholicherald.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Age Action Year will also see the provision of a foundation for co-ordinated research into ageing itself. This opens up exciting possibilities for everyone, because if we are to make old age a time of interest and healthy activity we have to know how to make people fit into later years, how to make the best use of available resources and how to gear our living throughout our lives so that we know how to make the best of our own 'bonus years'.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Britain badly needs this foundation, because although we are ahead of so many countries in the field of geriatric medicine, we do lag behind in not having a foundation to co-ordinate and direct various fields of research.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The research envisaged will tackle memory loss and [[senile dementia]], which affects 27 per cent of those over 85; it will tackle [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], which is both distressing and humiliating; [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], which is the cause of many heart attacks and strokes; [[retirement]], with its problems and opportunities, and other social matters.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The foundation will mean that every one of us can look to a more hopeful future. This new foundation which has such potential will require a lot of money, and it was this which prompted Sir Lindsay Ring (Lord Mayor of London till last month) to make Age Action Year his special appeal and put into it all his energy and enthusiasm.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>This was infectious, and the money has been coming in: first from individuals whose contributions are still required, then from companies and trusts, and recently a significant move has come from the trade union movement. Jack Jones challenged members of his own union and others to donate one penny a week from their wages.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>People in Britain have become more aware than ever before of the needs of the elderly. They have also seen that these needs can be met on the two fronts pioneered by Age Action Year. First, at the local level, so much can be done for the elderly among us. Secondly, at the research level: and we can all contribute to the setting up of the new foundation.</blockquote>\n\nThe BSRA had worked exceptionally hard to promote the Foundation which was originally known as the British Foundation for Ageing Research (or BFAR) but which was to become the respected charity Research Into Ageing.  This name change was initiated in 1988.\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\n\nThe BSRA obtained charitable status (1980) which it retains to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ |title=Find charities |publisher=Charity Commission}}</ref> There was a marked upswing in the activity and membership of the society from the mid-1990s onwards as a result of importance of research into the biology of ageing given in both the Office of Science and Technology (OST) Extend Quality Life (or EQUAL) initiative (1995) which sought to use \"the combined resources, expertise and capacity for innovation of the science and engineering base to extend the active period of people's lives and in the subsequent Technology Foresight review\"<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20000815202529/http://www.dti.gov.uk/Minspeech/sain130600.htm http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmsctech/43/4304.htm National Archives (UK)]</ref>\n\n=== Millennium to the present ===\n\nTo mark the 60th annual meeting of the BSRA, the membership voted to bestow honorary life membership on all Cohen Medallists then still living.

From 1910\u20131915 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. He took courses philosophy, architecture and [[agronomy]]. On his return to Krak\u00f3w he entered the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], and also worked in his father's studio. In 1915 he began to travel frequently to [[Zakopane]] where he spent extensive periods, to climb, ski and paint, until the [[outbreak of World War II]]. He joined the local [[Mountain rescue]] team, [[Tatrza\u0144skie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe|TOPR]]. However in 1917 on the south face of \"Zamar\u0142a Turnia\" he and his climbing companion, Stanis\u0142aw Bronikowski, were caught in a climbing accident in which his friend died, while Malczewski clung to a hook all night awaiting rescue.\n\nIn October 1917 he married Bronis\u0142awa Dziadosz, an English teacher four years his senior and a [[US citizen]] of Polish descent who had immigrated into Poland. In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child, Zofia. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1932 he joined the \"Rhythm Association of artists (Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d) and was a set designer for productions of [[Strindberg]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz]] at the ''Formistyczny Theatre'' in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\n[[File:Rafal Malczewski Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Rafa\u0142 Malczewski in [[Ottawa]]. He settled in [[Canada]] in 1942]]\nIn 1939 after the [[outbreak of World War II]], having already abandoned his wife and children, he escaped over the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, with his partner Zofia Mikucka, and via [[Budapest]] and [[Venice]] made his way to [[Paris]]. Here he fell on the generosity of the Polish embassy there to help him out of another financial difficulty. In 1940 they travelled on to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where they stayed for four months. At the beginning of 1941 they moved to [[Brazil]]. At first they stayed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where he was able to sell some of his paintings which consisted of water colour landscapes of Rio, [[Curitiba]] and of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Parana]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=CANADIAN ART CRITICS ON RAFA\u0141 MALCZEWSKI|author= Krzy\u017canowski, Jerzy R.|journal=The Polish Review|volume= 38, No. 2 |date=1993|pages=191-201}}</ref><ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nIn 1942 they moved to Curitiba to stay with his cousin, Maria Bochdan-Niedenthal. Shortly after, he succeeded in obtaining Canadian visas for himself and his girlfriend, Zofia, for travel to [[Ottawa]]. By December 1942 he held his first Canadian exhibition in the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. He managed to persuade the [[Canadian railways]] to sponsor him and Zofia to travel across [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] in search of artistic subjects. He spent the winter of 1943 in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which led to a series of canvases that kept him supplied for many exhibitions until 1949. A stay in [[New York City|New York]] in 1950 was fruitful enough for further sales of his work. \n\nDespite developing problems with his sight, like his father before him, the ensuing years saw a great flowering of his painting and writing. After his wife, Bronislawa died in Warsaw in 1953, he finally married Zofia Mikucka.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coraz trudniej \u017cy\u0107, a umrze\u0107 strach, Listy 1952\u20131955|trans-title=It gets more difficult to live, but perish the thought of dying.

He managed to obtain sponsorship from the CIA-controlled [[Radio Free Europe]] and from [[Quebec City]]. In 1959 the daughter of Zofia Malczewska-Kondracka invited him to visit Poland. Despite great nostalgia for the south of the country, he  resolved to remain in Canada, but his journey was described in his memoir, ''Wspomnieniach z Polski'' and serialised in the [[London]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 paper,[[Wiadomo\u015bci (London magazine)|Wiadomo\u015bci]]. From 1961 he was kept by his daughter, Zofia, and three years later, in 1964 his last exhibition took place in [[Montreal]]. He died and was buried there in 1965.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Characteristics of his art ==\nMagdalena Ma\u0142etko has emphasised several pointers to understand Malczewski's art. His successful artist father wished him to have a more reliable career than his own. While at the University of Vienna Malczewski studied [[Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]] as part of the philosophy course, but he failed to complete his degree. He never got over the death of his close friend and climbing partner Bronikowski, who died on a climb they did together in 1917. His first marriage was an attempt to get over his grief and was loveless, and more of a duty due to Bronis\u0142awa's pregnancy. Painting came to him instinctually as he watched his prolific father working in his studio. Malczewski was an artist difficult to categorise, although he developed his own distinctive style. This has been called \"hyper realism\" (Witkacy) and \"naive\". His themes were predominantly empty vistas, mountain scenery, snowscapes and glassy lakes. He also did portraits, cartoons and a series of rally cars and industrial scenery in [[Silesia]]. The great hiatus of his life was leaving his family and his beloved Zakopane in 1939. Three years later he had settled in Canada having travelled through Southern Europe and Brazil, where his palette responded to the colour and light. His later life was a struggle with increasing blindness and paralysis which allowed him only to use water colour, alongside his writing, which he managed to do until his death.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ma\u0142etko, Magdalena|title= Rafa\u0142 Malczewski i jego widzenie nowoczesno\u015bci|date=2009   |url=https://www.kul.pl/files/564/public/ARTykuly/ARTykuly002/ARTykuly_nr002_2009_MM_s22.pdf|lang=pl|publisher=www.kul.pl|access-date=2020-04-14|trans-title=Rafa\u0142 Malczewski and his vision of modernity}}</ref>\n\n== Selected exhibitions and awards==\nMalczewski's first public show was with [[Witkacy]] at Garlinski's Salon in Warsaw in 1924.<ref name = \"IK\"/> Solo shows followed in:\n* Zakopane (1926)\n* Warsaw (1928, 1929, 1935, 1938)\n* Krak\u00f3w (1930, 1932) \n* [[Lodz|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1935)\n* [[Katowice]] (1938) \n* Montreal Museum of Arts ( 1942)\n* Dominion Gallery (1949)  \n* Corcoran Gallery, [[Washington, D.C.]] (1944).<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nAs a member of the Society for the Propagation of Polish Art Abroad, he participated in the following group exhibitions:\n* [[Prague]] and [[Helsinki]] (1929)\n* Vienna and Paris (1928) \n* [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]] (1929)\n* Budapest and [[Copenhagen]] (1930)\n* Venice (13th Biennale) and [[Los Angeles]] (1932)\n* [[Moscow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[San Francisco]] (1933)\n* New York (1933)\n* [[Berlin]] (1936)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1938)\n* [[Ottawa]] (1942)\n* [[Detroit]] (1945) \n* [[Montreal]] (1954). \nAmong the many awards he received were:\n* President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] prize 1930\n* Golden laurel of ''Polska Akademia Literatury'' 1937\n* Gold Medal for his ''Wiosna w g\u00f3rach'' [\"Spring in the mountains\"] at the Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] 1937\n* ''The Visual Arts Prize'' of Paris-based Polish-language monthly, ''[[Kultura]]'' 1962.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Selected written work ==\nIn his writing Rafa\u0142 Malczewski evoked the atmosphere of [[Interbellum Poland|interbellum]] Zakopane:\n* ''Od cepra do wariata'', [From Lowland Dweller to Madman]\n* ''Narkotyk g\u00f3r.

From 1910\u20131915 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. He took courses philosophy, architecture and [[agronomy]]. On his return to Krak\u00f3w he entered the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], and also worked in his father's studio. In 1915 he began to travel frequently to [[Zakopane]] where he spent extensive periods, to climb, ski and paint, until the [[outbreak of World War II]]. He joined the local [[Mountain rescue]] team, [[Tatrza\u0144skie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe|TOPR]]. However in 1917 on the south face of \"Zamar\u0142a Turnia\" he and his climbing companion, Stanis\u0142aw Bronikowski, were caught in a climbing accident in which his friend died, while Malczewski clung to a hook all night awaiting rescue.\n\nIn October 1917 he married Bronis\u0142awa Dziadosz, an English teacher four years his senior and a [[US citizen]] of Polish descent who had immigrated into Poland. In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child, Zofia. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1932 he joined the \"Rhythm Association of artists (Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d) and was a set designer for productions of [[Strindberg]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz]] at the ''Formistyczny Theatre'' in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\n[[File:Rafal Malczewski Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Rafa\u0142 Malczewski in [[Ottawa]]. He settled in [[Canada]] in 1942]]\nIn 1939 after the [[outbreak of World War II]], having already abandoned his wife and children, he escaped over the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, with his partner Zofia Mikucka, and via [[Budapest]] and [[Venice]] made his way to [[Paris]]. Here he fell on the generosity of the Polish embassy there to help him out of another financial difficulty. In 1940 they travelled on to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where they stayed for four months. At the beginning of 1941 they moved to [[Brazil]]. At first they stayed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where he was able to sell some of his paintings which consisted of water colour landscapes of Rio, [[Curitiba]] and of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Parana]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=CANADIAN ART CRITICS ON RAFA\u0141 MALCZEWSKI|author= Krzy\u017canowski, Jerzy R.|journal=The Polish Review|volume= 38, No. 2 |date=1993|pages=191-201}}</ref><ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nIn 1942 they moved to Curitiba to stay with his cousin, Maria Bochdan-Niedenthal. Shortly after, he succeeded in obtaining Canadian visas for himself and his girlfriend, Zofia, for travel to [[Ottawa]]. By December 1942 he held his first Canadian exhibition in the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. He managed to persuade the [[Canadian railways]] to sponsor him and Zofia to travel across [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] in search of artistic subjects. He spent the winter of 1943 in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which led to a series of canvases that kept him supplied for many exhibitions until 1949. A stay in [[New York City|New York]] in 1950 was fruitful enough for further sales of his work. \n\nDespite developing problems with his sight, like his father before him, the ensuing years saw a great flowering of his painting and writing. After his wife, Bronislawa died in Warsaw in 1953, he finally married Zofia Mikucka.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coraz trudniej \u017cy\u0107, a umrze\u0107 strach, Listy 1952\u20131955|trans-title=It gets more difficult to live, but perish the thought of dying.

He managed to obtain sponsorship from the CIA-controlled [[Radio Free Europe]] and from [[Quebec City]]. In 1959 the daughter of Zofia Malczewska-Kondracka invited him to visit Poland. Despite great nostalgia for the south of the country, he  resolved to remain in Canada, but his journey was described in his memoir, ''Wspomnieniach z Polski'' and serialised in the [[London]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 paper,[[Wiadomo\u015bci (London magazine)|Wiadomo\u015bci]]. From 1961 he was kept by his daughter, Zofia, and three years later, in 1964 his last exhibition took place in [[Montreal]]. He died and was buried there in 1965.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Characteristics of his art ==\nMagdalena Ma\u0142etko has emphasised several pointers to understand Malczewski's art. His successful artist father wished him to have a more reliable career than his. While at the University of Vienna Malczewski studied [[Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]] as part of the philosophy course, but he failed to complete his degree. He never got over the death of his close friend and climbing partner Bronikowski, who died on a climb they did together in 1917. His first marriage was an attempt to get over his grief and was loveless, and more of a duty due to Bronis\u0142awa's pregnancy. Painting came to him instinctually as he watched his prolific father working in his studio. Malczewski was an artist difficult to categorise, although he developed his own distinctive style. This has been called \"hyper realism\" (Witkacy) and \"naive\". His themes were predominantly empty vistas, mountain scenery, snowscapes and glassy lakes. He also did portraits, cartoons and a series of rally cars and industrial scenery in [[Silesia]]. The great hiatus of his life was leaving his family and his beloved Zakopane in 1939. Three years later he had settled in Canada having travelled through Southern Europe and Brazil, where his palette responded to the colour and light. His later life was a struggle with increasing blindness and paralysis which allowed him only to use water colour, alongside his writing, which he managed to do until his death.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ma\u0142etko, Magdalena|title= Rafa\u0142 Malczewski i jego widzenie nowoczesno\u015bci|date=2009   |url=https://www.kul.pl/files/564/public/ARTykuly/ARTykuly002/ARTykuly_nr002_2009_MM_s22.pdf|lang=pl|publisher=www.kul.pl|access-date=2020-04-14|trans-title=Rafa\u0142 Malczewski and his vision of modernity}}</ref>\n\n== Selected exhibitions and awards==\nMalczewski's first public show was with [[Witkacy]] at Garlinski's Salon in Warsaw in 1924.<ref name = \"IK\"/> Solo shows followed in:\n* Zakopane (1926)\n* Warsaw (1928, 1929, 1935, 1938)\n* Krak\u00f3w (1930, 1932) \n* [[Lodz|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1935)\n* [[Katowice]] (1938) \n* Montreal Museum of Arts ( 1942)\n* Dominion Gallery (1949)  \n* Corcoran Gallery, [[Washington, D.C.]] (1944).<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nAs a member of the Society for the Propagation of Polish Art Abroad, he participated in the following group exhibitions:\n* [[Prague]] and [[Helsinki]] (1929)\n* Vienna and Paris (1928) \n* [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]] (1929)\n* Budapest and [[Copenhagen]] (1930)\n* Venice (13th Biennale) and [[Los Angeles]] (1932)\n* [[Moscow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[San Francisco]] (1933)\n* New York (1933)\n* [[Berlin]] (1936)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1938)\n* [[Ottawa]] (1942)\n* [[Detroit]] (1945) \n* [[Montreal]] (1954). \nAmong the many awards he received were:\n* President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] prize 1930\n* Golden laurel of ''Polska Akademia Literatury'' 1937\n* Gold Medal for his ''Wiosna w g\u00f3rach'' [\"Spring in the mountains\"] at the Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] 1937\n* ''The Visual Arts Prize'' of Paris-based Polish-language monthly, ''[[Kultura]]'' 1962.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Selected written work ==\nIn his writing Rafa\u0142 Malczewski evoked the atmosphere of [[Interbellum Poland|interbellum]] Zakopane:\n* ''Od cepra do wariata'', [From Lowland Dweller to Madman]\n* ''Narkotyk g\u00f3r.

The original model, '''HP-41C''', was the first of its kind to offer [[alphanumeric]] display capabilities. Later came the '''HP-41CV''' and '''HP-41CX''', offering more memory and functionality.\n\n== The alphanumeric \"revolution\" ==\nThe [[alphanumeric]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen of the HP-41C revolutionized the way a pocket calculator could be used, providing user friendliness (for its time) and expandability (keyboard-unassigned functions could be spelled out alphabetically). By using an alphanumeric display, the calculator could tell the user what was going on: it could display meaningful error messages (\"<tt>ZERO DIVIDE</tt>\") instead of simply a blinking zero; it could also specifically prompt the user for arguments (\"<tt>ENTER RADIUS</tt>\") instead of just displaying a question mark.\n\nEarlier calculators needed a key, or key combination, for every available function. The [[HP-67]] had three shift keys (gold \"f\", blue \"g\" and black \"h\" prefix keys); the competing [[Texas Instruments]] calculators had two (<u>2nd</u> and <u>INV</u>) and close to 50 keys (the [[TI-59]] had 45). Hewlett-Packard were constrained by their one byte only instruction format. The more flexible storage format for programs in the [[TI-59]] allowed combining more keys into one instruction. The longest instruction required eleven keypresses, re-using the shift keys four times. The TI-59 also made use of the <u>Op</u> key followed by two digits to access another 40 different functions, but the user had to remember the codes for them. Clearly, a more convenient and flexible method of executing the calculator's instructions was needed. The HP-41C had a relatively small keyboard, and only one shift key, but provided hundreds of functions. Every function that was not assigned to a key could be invoked through the <u>XEQ</u> key (pronounced ''E'''XEQ'''TE''&nbsp;&mdash; \"execute\") and spelled out in full, e.g. <u>XEQ</u> FACT for the [[factorial]] function.\n\nThe calculator had a special user mode where the user could assign any function to any key if the default assignments provided by HP were not suited to a specific application. For this mode, the HP-41C came with blank keyboard templates; i.e. plastic covers with holes for the keys, so the user could annotate customized keys. Hewlett-Packard even sold a version of the calculator where hardly any keys had function names printed on them, meant for users who would be using the HP-41C for custom calculations only (thus not needing the standard key layout at all); this version of the calculator was colloquially known, within HP's Corvallis calculator team, as a \"Blanknut\" (because the development code name for the HP-41C's processor was known as the \"coconut\").<ref name=\"Coconut\"/>\n\nAlphanumeric display also greatly eased editing programs, as functions were spelled out in full. Numeric-only calculators displayed programming steps as a list of numbers, each number generally mapped to a key on the keyboard, often via row and column coordinates. Encoding functions to the corresponding numeric codes, and vice versa, was left to the user, having to look up the function&ndash;code combinations in a reference guide. The busy programmer quickly learned most of the codes, but having to learn the codes intimidated the beginners. In addition to this, the user had to mentally keep function codes separate from numeric constants in the program listing.\n\nThe HP-41C displayed each character in a block consisting of 14 segments that could be turned on or off; a so-called [[fourteen segment display]] (similar to the much more common [[seven segment display]]s, which can be used to display digits only). The HP-41C used a liquid-crystal display instead of the ubiquitous [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays of the era, to reduce power consumption.\n\nWhile this allowed the display of uppercase letters, digits, and a few punctuation characters (the [[FOCAL character set]]), some designs needed to be twisted arbitrarily (e.g. to distinguish S from 5) and lowercase letters were unreadable (HP only provided display of lowercase letters a through e). HP's competitor [[Sharp Electronics|Sharp]], when introducing the [[Sharp PC-1211|PC-1211]], used a [[dot matrix]] of 5&times;7 dots and displayed the characters in principle as we see them today on computer screens (and, in fact, many LCD screens on various [[embedded system]]s); this was later used by HP with the [[HP-71B]] handheld computer.\n\n== The HP-41CV and CX ==\nMany users had used all four ports for memory expansion, leaving no room for other modules. HP designed the ''Quad Memory Module'' with four times the amount of memory, providing the maximum available memory and leaving three empty ports available. The '''HP-41CV''' (V being the [[Roman numeral]] for 5) included this memory module on the main board, thus providing five times the memory of the HP-41C, and four available slots.\n\nThe internal architecture prohibited the addition of more memory, so HP designed an extended memory module that could be seen as secondary storage. You could not access the data directly, but you could transfer it to and from main memory. To the calculator (and the user), data located in the extended memory looked like files on a modern hard disk do for a PC (user).\n\nThe final HP-41 model, the '''HP-41CX''', included extended memory, a built-in time module, and extended functions.  It was introduced in 1983 and discontinued in 1990.\n\n== Programming ==\n\nThe HP-41C is [[keystroke programmable]] meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. These keystroke programs, in addition to performing any operation normally available on the keyboard, can also make use of conditional and unconditional branching and looping instructions, allowing programs to perform repetitive operations and make decisions.\n\nThe HP-41C also supports indirect addressing ([[Computed GOTO|computed goto]]) with which it is possible to implement a [[Universal Turing machine]] and therefore the programming model of the HP-41C can be considered [[Turing complete]]. The combination of indirect addressing and gotos easily led to [[spaghetti code]].\n\nProgram steps are numbered starting from 1, but this numbering has no intrinsic meaning and changes as new instructions are added or removed in the middle of a program. A special LBL instruction is used to create a label that is then referenced by the user to invoke the program, or by the program itself as target of a GTO (unconditional goto) or XEQ (execute) instruction.\n\n=== Programming example ===\nHere is a sample program that computes the factorial of an integer number between 1 and 69 (70! needing an exponent greater than 99, the calculator's maximum), that integer being passed as a parameter via the X register. The program takes up 2 registers which is \u224814 bytes.\n\n '''Step  Op-code      Comment'''\n \n 01    LBL'Fac      ALPHA label makes program callable by 'XEQ Fac'\n 02    STO 00       Store X=parameter in register 0\n 03    1            Enter 1 in X, \"lifting\" the stack; Y=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                       X=1\n 04    LBL 00       Label for goto\n 05    RCL 00       Recall register 0 into X, lifting stack; Z=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                             Y=1 or interim or final factorial\n                                                             X=parameter or N-I decrement\n 06    *            Multiply X and Y, \"dropping\" the stack; Y=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                            X=interim or final factorial\n 07    DSE 00       '''D'''ecrement register 0 and '''S'''kip next command when register value is '''E'''qual to 0\n 08    GTO 00       Go to label 0\n 09    END          End program - result displayed in X\n\n=== FOCAL ===\n\nThough the programming language used on the 41 series is a version of the keystroke programming languages used all preceding programmable HP calculators, the range of technologies, and programming-related usability and extensibility features available in 41 series models (notably keyboard overlays, a fully remappable keyboard, I/O capabilities for storing and sharing programs, and alphanumeric support), led some users to propose a new name for the language, resulting in a competition that was won by \"FOCAL\" for \"Forty One Calculator Language\".<ref name=\"Wiley_1984\"/><ref name=\"Extend_1985\"/><ref name=\"HEPAX_1988\"/> As the name FOCAL was [[FOCAL (programming language)|already in use]] by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], the name was never formally adopted by HP.\n\n== Synthetic programming ==\nA large users' community was built around the HP-41C. Enthusiasts around the world found new ways of programming, created their own software (such as a codebreaking game,{{R|carbrey198012}} and a version of ''[[Hunt the Wumpus]]''<ref name=\"librach198102\"/>) and expansion modules, and sped up the clock (see [[overclocking]]). Most of these activities were coordinated by the PPC club and its president, Richard J. Nelson. The PPC club published the [[PPC Journal]] and produced the PPC ROM, a collection of highly optimized low-level programs for the HP-41C.\n\nOne of the discoveries of the community was that, because some FOCAL instructions were stored in memory as more than one byte, it is possible to exploit a bug in the program editor to assign strange functions to keys. The most important function was known as the byte jumper, a way to step partially through programming instructions and edit them in ways that were not otherwise allowed. The use of the resulting instructions was called ''[[Synthetic Programming (HP-41)|synthetic programming]]''.\n\nThrough synthetic instructions, a user could access memory and special status flags reserved for the operating system, and do very strange things, including completely locking the machine. It was possible to create sounds or display characters, and create animations not officially supported by the operating system. The system flags were also accessed as low-level shortcuts to boolean programming techniques. Hewlett-Packard did not officially support synthetic programming, but neither did it do anything to prevent it, and eventually even provided internal documentation to the user groups.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn its December 1980 issue, ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' magazine described the HP-41C as \"the most versatile machine ever\". The author praised HP's documentation as \"among the best in the industry\", and reported that the calculator was \"''much'' easier to program and debug\" than the TI-59. Stating \"I found the HP-41C far more pleasurable to program and use than its predecessors\" because of its alphanumeric display, the author concluded that it was \"maybe not quite\" a pocket computer.<ref name=\"carbrey198012\" /> In the next issue, another author wrote that \"The HP-41C&nbsp;... is among the programmable calculators that lie closest to the computer borderline. It comes close enough for the jargon of computers to be useful in describing it\", and praised the simplicity and reliability of the card reader and compatibility with HP-67 and HP-97 software. The review criticized the inaccuracies in calculations from the lack of [[guard digit]]s; \"There is something absurd about the world's fanciest calculator not being able to give results accurate to more than seven or eight decimal places\".<ref name=\"hayes198101\" /> Hewlett-Packard responded that the alleged imprecision was inherent to arithmetic on any computer with finite precision.<ref name=\"abell198104\" />\n\n== Use on the Space Shuttle ==\n[[File:NASA HP-41CV.jpg|thumb|NASA HP-41CV with Velcro to hold it in carrying case, 1983.]]\n[[File:STS007-14-629.jpg|thumb|left|Astronaut [[Sally Ride]] on mission [[STS-7]] with three HP-41C floating behind her]]\nA HP-41C that flew on nine early [[Space Shuttle]] missions is on display in the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C. HP-41Cs with some special hardware configurations (the addition of [[Velcro]] strips, pre-production time module, and louder beeper, as well as the removal of parts whose [[outgassing]] could cause contamination) were carried on early Shuttle missions for the purpose of performing mundane but necessary calculations, such as calculating the change to the center of gravity due to fuel consumption. The HP-41C was also programmed to handle calculations usually performed by the main on-board computer, such as determining ignition times for re-entry, in the case of a main computer failure.<ref name=\"NASM\" /><ref name=\"Jarett\" />\n\n== Expandability ==\nThe functions of the calculator could be expanded by adding modules at the top of the machine. Four slots were available to add more memory, pre-programmed solution packs containing programs covering engineering, surveying, physics, math, finance, games, etc. As such, an HP-41 could in fact be tailored to the personal needs of the user. Hardware extensions included a [[thermal printer]], a magnetic card reader (HP-67 compatible via converter software), and a barcode \"wand\" (reader).\n\nExtension modules could also add new instructions to the machine. The standard set of mathematical functions of the 41-series was somewhat limited when compared to the functionality of some  contemporary HP calculators (notably the [[HP-34C]] and the [[HP-15C]]). Among others, the standard function set offered no integration or root-finding capabilities and lacked support for matrices and complex numbers; these extra functions could be added by an extension module.\n\nAnother module, known as the [[HP-IL|Interface Loop]] allowed for connection of more peripherals: larger printers, [[microcassette]] tape recorders, 3\u00bd-inch [[floppy disk]] drives, [[RS-232]] communication interfaces, video display interfaces, etc. The Interface Loop could also be used with the [[HP-71B]], [[HP-75]] and [[HP-110]] computers.\n\n[[File:0978 - HP41CX Expansion Slots.jpg|thumb|Extension slots of the HP-41CX]]\n'''HP-41 extension (or expansion) modules''' allowed the user of a [[HP-41]] programmable calculator to extend the functionality of the machine. The HP-41 had room for up to four expansion modules at the back of calculator.\n\nThe HP-41 was not the only calculator of its generation that allowed expansion modules. The [[TI-58]] and [[TI-59]] also had pluggable ROM modules. The HP-41 modules were however much more versatile.\n\n=== Memory modules (HP-41C only) ===\n[[File:1028 - HP82106A.jpg|thumb|HP 82106A memory module for HP-41C]]\n[[File:HP-41C QUAD MEMORY.JPG|thumb|HP 82170A QUAD memory module for HP-41C]]\n\nMemory modules added [[random-access memory|RAM]] main memory to the calculator, allowing more programming steps and/or more data registers.\n\nThe original HP-41C had a main memory of 63 registers of 7 [[byte]]s each. Each register could hold either a number, a 6-character string, or up to seven program steps in the [[Focal (HP-41)|FOCAL]] language (program steps used a variable number of bytes).\n\nEach memory module added 64 registers, and the calculator could hold up to four of them, for a grand total of 319 registers. While this was considered huge for the time (a little more than 2 [[kilobyte]]s,) all expansion slots were used. User groups found a way to merge two memory chips in a single module, thus freeing two expansion slots. HP designed a module holding all four in one slot, the so-called ''Quad Memory Module''. The later HP-41CV had the quad module built-in.\n\n=== Application pacs ===\nThe [[read-only memory|ROM]]-based application 'pac' modules added up to 4 kilobytes of read-only memory (some up to 8 kilobytes, but these were simply two independent 4K modules in the same box). Most modules held dozens of programs written in the HP-41C programming language, FOCAL.\n\nPrograms in the ROM modules could be called from a user program, using the ubiquitous XEQ function. In the program code, XEQ appeared as \"<tt>XROM</tt>\" when it was used to call a ROM program.\n\n=== 82104A card reader ===\n[[File:1027 - 82104A.jpg|thumb|HP 82104A&nbsp;- card reader/writer]]\n[[File:HP magnetic card.jpg|thumb|HP magnetic card]]\nThe card reader was a device able to read and write small rectangular plastic cards with two magnetic strips. The card reader could copy contents of memory onto magnetic cards, and later read back the data into memory.\n\nAs the HP-41C had [[non-volatile memory]] (user programs and data were not wiped out when power was off) there was no absolute need for a permanent storage device, so the card reader was optional.\n\nEach card held two strips of 112 bytes each, that could hold 16 data registers or up to 112 program steps. This limited capacity resulted in typical programs requiring five or more magnetic cards to be saved. A full backup of the machine's 319 memory registers plus internal data required 11 magnetic cards (each card had to be inserted twice.)\n\nThe card reader could read magnetic cards from the earlier model [[HP-67]]. HP-67 programs were translated into HP-41C instructions, as the HP-67 and HP-41 share the same programming model and operation stack. Some instructions however were specific to the HP-67, and the card reader provided additional instructions to emulate the 67.\n\nMagnetic cards could be write-protected, and programs saved as private: once loaded back, the source code for the program could not be displayed. This made magnetic cards an obvious choice for program distribution.\n\nHowever, the electric motor put a heavy strain on the calculator batteries, and the price tag for blank cards put an even heavier strain on the user's wallet.\n\n=== 82182A time module ===\nThe time module added a real-time clock. The clock allowed use of real-world time in programs. The user could set alarms that triggered calls to user programs. The alarms were able to switch the calculator on, so it was possible to create programs that executed at some point during the day, then switch the calculator off until the next alarm. As the HP-41 was often used as a data-gathering device in labs, this allowed the calculator to read data from monitored devices at specific times every day, without having to remain fully powered up in between readings (thus saving battery capacity).\n\nThe HP-41CX had the time module built in.\n\n=== 82143A thermal printer/plotter ===\nThe printer used rolls of thermal paper to print lines of up to 24 characters. The thermal paper provided for a bluish printout, but was somewhat unstable, as the printout could vanish or the whole paper turn blue due to excessive heat.\n\nThe printer had some graphical capabilities, to allow the user to design character shapes, or even turn on or off individual pixels. However, the buffer memory could not hold sufficient information to print a whole line in graphic mode, and could not alter line spacing, so it was impossible to print continuous graphics in horizontal mode. The printer, nevertheless, provided some printing utilities that were able to graph a function vertically onto the narrow strip of printer paper.\n\n=== 82242A infrared printer interface ===\nInstead of using the aforementioned printer, this module could be used to interface a thermal printer with an infrared interface, namely the [[HP 82240A]] and the [[HP 82240B]]. This allows for on-the-go printing without using cables&nbsp;- but the printer itself needs batteries as well.\n\n=== 82153A optical wand ===\n[[File:HP-WAND.jpg|thumb|HP 82153A&nbsp;- optical wand]]\nThe optical wand was a barcode reader shaped like a thick pen, and was designed to read lines of HP-proprietary standard barcodes into the calculator memory. The barcodes, printed in e.g. HP solutions books, could consist of programs, numeric or alphabetical constants, and even keypresses (letting the calculator be operated without using the keyboard)&nbsp;&mdash; useful for diagnosing calculators where the keyboard was suspected to be faulty.\n\n=== 82180A extended functions module ===\n[[File:HP-41C Extended Functions Memory Module.JPG|thumb|X Functions module 82180A for HP-41C/CV]]\n\nThe Extended Functions module added many functionalities the users had wanted for ages, as the ability to programmatically assign functions to keys, repartition memory, etc.\n\nBut the most important new function was the management of extended memory: while the HP-41C could theoretically access up\nto 1024 registers, the early design limited main memory to 319 registers only. The Extended Functions module added instructions\nto manage a bank of additional memory in the available addressing space of the machine. As this memory was not directly\naddressable by user programs, it was seen as a set of named files containing either programs or data. Programs and data registers could\nbe copied back and forth from the extended memory to the main memory, where they could be accessed as usual.\n\nExtended memory could also hold [[ASCII]] files, and a rudimentary [[text editor]] was added also.\n\nThe Extended Functions module contained 124 registers of Extended memory. More could be added by ... Extended Memory modules.\nThe HP-41CX contained the Extended Functions module as standard.\n\n=== 82181A extended memory module ===\n[[File:0986 - HP41CX X Memory HP82181A.jpg|thumb|X Memory module HP82181A for HP-41CX]]\nExtended memory modules added more extended memory to the HP-41C. They required an extended functions module to be present, or the\nHP-41CX version of the calculator.\n\nEach module added 238 registers of extended memory. Up to two extended memory modules could be inserted, for a grand total of \n124 + 2*238 = 600 registers. Added to the 319 registers of main memory, this covered practically all of the machine's 1024\naddressable registers, for a total of 919 registers, or 6433 bytes.\n\n=== HP82160A HP interface loop (HP-IL) module ===\n''See the main article on [[HP-IL]].''\n\n== {{anchor|DM41|DM41L}}Clones ==\nThe continued popularity of the HP-41CX among users prompted [[SwissMicros]] to produce a miniature calculator approximating the size of an [[ID-1 format|ID-1]] credit card (88&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 59&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 7&nbsp;mm) in 2015. Named ''DM41'', it runs the original HP-41CX firmware with extended memory and realtime clock in an emulator on an [[ARM Cortex-M0]]-based [[NXP]] [[LPC1115]] processor.<ref name=\"SM\"/> Deviating from the original, it comes in a landscape form factor (as known from Hewlett-Packard's [[HP Voyager series|Voyager series]]) with rearranged keys, it features a dot-matrix display, switchable <!-- fonts and -->clock speeds, and, based on a [[Silicon Labs]] CP2102<!-- CP2102 or CP2102N? --> converter chip,<ref name=\"DM15\"/> it comes with a [[USB]] ([[USB Mini-B|Mini-B]]<ref name=\"SM_Serial\"/>) serial interface to exchange data with a PC etc. for backup purposes, to possibly communicate with applications (like PC-based emulators<ref name=\"DM15\"/>), or to update the firmware. In December 2015, SwissMicros introduced the ''DM41L'', a version of the calculator about the same size as the calculators of the [[HP Voyager series]]. It still comes with a USB Mini-B connector.\n\n== Images ==\n<gallery>\n  File:0934 - HP41CX.jpg|Alphanumeric display of a HP-41CX\n  File:0940 - HP-IL.jpg|HP-IL interface module\n  File:0960 1 2 - HP82162A HP41CX.jpg|HP82162A thermal printer (with HP-IL connection)\n  File:0969 70 71 - HP82161A.jpg|HP82161A cassette drive with storage medium (with HP-IL connection)\n  File:0975 6 7 - HP41 Interface Loop.jpg|Interface loop with thermal printer HP82162A (front left), a cassette drive HP82161A (back left) and a HP-41CX\n  File:1033 - HP82163B.jpg|HP 82163B&nbsp;- 32 columns video interface for HP-IL\n  File:0978 - HP41CX Expansion Slots.jpg|Extension slots of a HP-41CX\n  File:0943 - HP82242A IR-Interface.jpg|HP82242A IR-interface (to a thermal printer)\n  File:1027 - 82104A.jpg|HP 82104A&nbsp;- card reader/writer for HP-41C\n  File:0986 - HP41CX X Memory HP82181A.jpg|X Memory module HP82181A (memory extension)\n  File:0992 - HP41CX Stat I.jpg|Statistics module\n  File:1028 - HP82106A.jpg|HP 82106A memory module for HP-41C\n  File:1022 - HP82120A.jpg|HP 82120A battery pack for the HP-41CX with damaged NiCd cells (original)\n  File:0995 - HP41CX Bat Pack.jpg|HP 82120A battery pack for the HP-41CX (the original NiCd cells were replaced by NiMH cells)\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[FOCAL character set]]\n* [[HP calculators]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Coconut\">HP documentation released to the HP-41C hobbyist community in the early 1980s; available at [http://www.hp41.org/LibView.cfm?Command=List&CategoryID=20 HP-41 Internal Documentation].</ref>\n<ref name=\"librach198102\">{{cite journal |author-last=Librach |author-first=Hank |title=Hunt the Wumpus with Your HP-41C |journal=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] |date=February 1981 |pages=230, 232 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n231/mode/2up |access-date=2013-10-18}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"carbrey198012\">{{Cite journal |author-last=Carbrey |author-first=Bruce D. |date=December 1980 |title=A Pocket Computer?

The original model, '''HP-41C''', was the first of its kind to offer [[alphanumeric]] display capabilities. Later came the '''HP-41CV''' and '''HP-41CX''', offering more memory and functionality.\n\n== The alphanumeric \"revolution\" ==\nThe [[alphanumeric]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen of the HP-41C revolutionized the way a pocket calculator could be used, providing user friendliness (for its time) and expandability (keyboard-unassigned functions could be spelled out alphabetically). By using an alphanumeric display, the calculator could tell the user what was going on: it could display meaningful error messages (\"<tt>ZERO DIVIDE</tt>\") instead of simply a blinking zero; it could also specifically prompt the user for arguments (\"<tt>ENTER RADIUS</tt>\") instead of just displaying a question mark.\n\nEarlier calculators needed a key, or key combination, for every available function. The [[HP-67]] had three shift keys (gold \"f\", blue \"g\" and black \"h\" prefix keys); the competing [[Texas Instruments]] calculators had two (<u>2nd</u> and <u>INV</u>) and close to 50 keys (the [[TI-59]] had 45). Hewlett-Packard were constrained by their one byte only instruction format. The more flexible storage format for programs in the [[TI-59]] allowed combining more keys into one instruction. The longest instruction required eleven keypresses, re-using the shift keys four times. The TI-59 also made use of the <u>Op</u> key followed by two digits to access another 40 different functions, but the user had to remember the codes for them. Clearly, a more convenient and flexible method of executing the calculator's instructions was needed. The HP-41C had a relatively small keyboard, and only one shift key, but provided hundreds of functions. Every function that was not assigned to a key could be invoked through the <u>XEQ</u> key (pronounced ''E'''XEQ'''TE''&nbsp;&mdash; \"execute\") and spelled out in full, e.g. <u>XEQ</u> FACT for the [[factorial]] function.\n\nThe calculator had a special user mode where the user could assign any function to any key if the default assignments provided by HP were not suited to a specific application. For this mode, the HP-41C came with blank keyboard templates; i.e. plastic covers with holes for the keys, so the user could annotate customized keys. Hewlett-Packard even sold a version of the calculator where hardly any keys had function names printed on them, meant for users who would be using the HP-41C for custom calculations only (thus not needing the standard key layout at all); this version of the calculator was colloquially known, within HP's Corvallis calculator team, as a \"Blanknut\" (because the development code name for the HP-41C's processor was known as the \"coconut\").<ref name=\"Coconut\"/>\n\nAlphanumeric display also greatly eased editing programs, as functions were spelled out in full. Numeric-only calculators displayed programming steps as a list of numbers, each number generally mapped to a key on the keyboard, often via row and column coordinates. Encoding functions to the corresponding numeric codes, and vice versa, was left to the user, having to look up the function&ndash;code combinations in a reference guide. The busy programmer quickly learned most of the codes, but having to learn the codes intimidated the beginners. In addition to this, the user had to mentally keep function codes separate from numeric constants in the program listing.\n\nThe HP-41C displayed each character in a block consisting of 14 segments that could be turned on or off; a so-called [[fourteen segment display]] (similar to the much more common [[seven segment display]]s, which can be used to display digits only). The HP-41C used a liquid-crystal display instead of the ubiquitous [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays of the era, to reduce power consumption.\n\nWhile this allowed the display of uppercase letters, digits, and a few punctuation characters (the [[FOCAL character set]]), some designs needed to be twisted arbitrarily (e.g. to distinguish S from 5) and lowercase letters were unreadable (HP only provided display of lowercase letters a through e). HP's competitor [[Sharp Electronics|Sharp]], when introducing the [[Sharp PC-1211|PC-1211]], used a [[dot matrix]] of 5&times;7 dots and displayed the characters in principle as we see them today on computer screens (and, in fact, many LCD screens on various [[embedded system]]s); this was later used by HP with the [[HP-71B]] handheld computer.\n\n== The HP-41CV and CX ==\nMany users had used all four ports for memory expansion, leaving no room for other modules. HP designed the ''Quad Memory Module'' with four times the amount of memory, providing the maximum available memory and leaving three empty ports available. The '''HP-41CV''' (V being the [[Roman numeral]] for 5) included this memory module on the main board, thus providing five times the memory of the HP-41C, and four available slots.\n\nThe internal architecture prohibited the addition of more memory, so HP designed an extended memory module that could be seen as secondary storage. You could not access the data directly, but you could transfer it to and from main memory. To the calculator (and the user), data located in the extended memory looked like files on a modern hard disk do for a PC (user).\n\nThe final HP-41 model, the '''HP-41CX''', included extended memory, a built-in time module, and extended functions.  It was introduced in 1983 and discontinued in 1990.\n\n== Programming ==\n\nThe HP-41C is [[keystroke programmable]] meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. These keystroke programs, in addition to performing any operation normally available on the keyboard, can also make use of conditional and unconditional branching and looping instructions, allowing programs to perform repetitive operations and make decisions.\n\nThe HP-41C also supports indirect addressing ([[Computed GOTO|computed goto]]) with which it is possible to implement a [[Universal Turing machine]] and therefore the programming model of the HP-41C can be considered [[Turing complete]]. The combination of indirect addressing and gotos easily led to [[spaghetti code]].\n\nProgram steps are numbered starting from 1, but this numbering has no intrinsic meaning and changes as new instructions are added or removed in the middle of a program. A special LBL instruction is used to create a label that is then referenced by the user to invoke the program, or by the program itself as target of a GTO (unconditional goto) or XEQ (execute) instruction.\n\n=== Programming example ===\nHere is a sample program that computes the factorial of an integer number between 1 and 69 (70! needing an exponent greater than 99, the calculator's maximum), that integer being passed as a parameter via the X register. The program takes up 2 registers which is \u224814 bytes.\n\n '''Step  Op-code      Comment'''\n \n 01    LBL'Fac      ALPHA label makes program callable by 'XEQ Fac'\n 02    STO 00       Store X=parameter in register 0\n 03    1            Enter 1 in X, \"lifting\" the stack; Y=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                       X=1\n 04    LBL 00       Label for goto\n 05    RCL 00       Recall register 0 into X, lifting stack; Z=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                             Y=1 or interim or final factorial\n                                                             X=parameter or N-I decrement\n 06    *            Multiply X and Y, \"dropping\" the stack; Y=parameter (no longer used)\n                                                            X=interim or final factorial\n 07    DSE 00       '''D'''ecrement register 0 and '''S'''kip next command when register value is '''E'''qual to 0\n 08    GTO 00       Go to label 0\n 09    END          End program - result displayed in X\n\n=== FOCAL ===\n\nThough the programming language used on the 41 series is a version of the keystroke programming languages used all preceding programmable HP calculators, the range of technologies and programming-related usability and extensibility features available in 41 series models (notably keyboard overlays, a fully remappable keyboard, I/O capabilities for storing and sharing programs, and alphanumeric support), led some users to propose a new name for the language, resulting in a competition that was won by \"FOCAL\" for \"Forty One Calculator Language\".<ref name=\"Wiley_1984\"/><ref name=\"Extend_1985\"/><ref name=\"HEPAX_1988\"/> As the name FOCAL was [[FOCAL (programming language)|already in use]] by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], the name was never formally adopted by HP.\n\n== Synthetic programming ==\nA large users' community was built around the HP-41C. Enthusiasts around the world found new ways of programming, created their own software (such as a codebreaking game,{{R|carbrey198012}} and a version of ''[[Hunt the Wumpus]]''<ref name=\"librach198102\"/>) and expansion modules, and sped up the clock (see [[overclocking]]). Most of these activities were coordinated by the PPC club and its president, Richard J. Nelson. The PPC club published the [[PPC Journal]] and produced the PPC ROM, a collection of highly optimized low-level programs for the HP-41C.\n\nOne of the discoveries of the community was that, because some FOCAL instructions were stored in memory as more than one byte, it is possible to exploit a bug in the program editor to assign strange functions to keys. The most important function was known as the byte jumper, a way to step partially through programming instructions and edit them in ways that were not otherwise allowed. The use of the resulting instructions was called ''[[Synthetic Programming (HP-41)|synthetic programming]]''.\n\nThrough synthetic instructions, a user could access memory and special status flags reserved for the operating system, and do very strange things, including completely locking the machine. It was possible to create sounds or display characters, and create animations not officially supported by the operating system. The system flags were also accessed as low-level shortcuts to boolean programming techniques. Hewlett-Packard did not officially support synthetic programming, but neither did it do anything to prevent it, and eventually even provided internal documentation to the user groups.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn its December 1980 issue, ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' magazine described the HP-41C as \"the most versatile machine ever\". The author praised HP's documentation as \"among the best in the industry\", and reported that the calculator was \"''much'' easier to program and debug\" than the TI-59. Stating \"I found the HP-41C far more pleasurable to program and use than its predecessors\" because of its alphanumeric display, the author concluded that it was \"maybe not quite\" a pocket computer.<ref name=\"carbrey198012\" /> In the next issue, another author wrote that \"The HP-41C&nbsp;... is among the programmable calculators that lie closest to the computer borderline. It comes close enough for the jargon of computers to be useful in describing it\", and praised the simplicity and reliability of the card reader and compatibility with HP-67 and HP-97 software. The review criticized the inaccuracies in calculations from the lack of [[guard digit]]s; \"There is something absurd about the world's fanciest calculator not being able to give results accurate to more than seven or eight decimal places\".<ref name=\"hayes198101\" /> Hewlett-Packard responded that the alleged imprecision was inherent to arithmetic on any computer with finite precision.<ref name=\"abell198104\" />\n\n== Use on the Space Shuttle ==\n[[File:NASA HP-41CV.jpg|thumb|NASA HP-41CV with Velcro to hold it in carrying case, 1983.]]\n[[File:STS007-14-629.jpg|thumb|left|Astronaut [[Sally Ride]] on mission [[STS-7]] with three HP-41C floating behind her]]\nA HP-41C that flew on nine early [[Space Shuttle]] missions is on display in the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C. HP-41Cs with some special hardware configurations (the addition of [[Velcro]] strips, pre-production time module, and louder beeper, as well as the removal of parts whose [[outgassing]] could cause contamination) were carried on early Shuttle missions for the purpose of performing mundane but necessary calculations, such as calculating the change to the center of gravity due to fuel consumption. The HP-41C was also programmed to handle calculations usually performed by the main on-board computer, such as determining ignition times for re-entry, in the case of a main computer failure.<ref name=\"NASM\" /><ref name=\"Jarett\" />\n\n== Expandability ==\nThe functions of the calculator could be expanded by adding modules at the top of the machine. Four slots were available to add more memory, pre-programmed solution packs containing programs covering engineering, surveying, physics, math, finance, games, etc. As such, an HP-41 could in fact be tailored to the personal needs of the user. Hardware extensions included a [[thermal printer]], a magnetic card reader (HP-67 compatible via converter software), and a barcode \"wand\" (reader).\n\nExtension modules could also add new instructions to the machine. The standard set of mathematical functions of the 41-series was somewhat limited when compared to the functionality of some  contemporary HP calculators (notably the [[HP-34C]] and the [[HP-15C]]). Among others, the standard function set offered no integration or root-finding capabilities and lacked support for matrices and complex numbers; these extra functions could be added by an extension module.\n\nAnother module, known as the [[HP-IL|Interface Loop]] allowed for connection of more peripherals: larger printers, [[microcassette]] tape recorders, 3\u00bd-inch [[floppy disk]] drives, [[RS-232]] communication interfaces, video display interfaces, etc. The Interface Loop could also be used with the [[HP-71B]], [[HP-75]] and [[HP-110]] computers.\n\n[[File:0978 - HP41CX Expansion Slots.jpg|thumb|Extension slots of the HP-41CX]]\n'''HP-41 extension (or expansion) modules''' allowed the user of a [[HP-41]] programmable calculator to extend the functionality of the machine. The HP-41 had room for up to four expansion modules at the back of calculator.\n\nThe HP-41 was not the only calculator of its generation that allowed expansion modules. The [[TI-58]] and [[TI-59]] also had pluggable ROM modules. The HP-41 modules were however much more versatile.\n\n=== Memory modules (HP-41C only) ===\n[[File:1028 - HP82106A.jpg|thumb|HP 82106A memory module for HP-41C]]\n[[File:HP-41C QUAD MEMORY.JPG|thumb|HP 82170A QUAD memory module for HP-41C]]\n\nMemory modules added [[random-access memory|RAM]] main memory to the calculator, allowing more programming steps and/or more data registers.\n\nThe original HP-41C had a main memory of 63 registers of 7 [[byte]]s each. Each register could hold either a number, a 6-character string, or up to seven program steps in the [[Focal (HP-41)|FOCAL]] language (program steps used a variable number of bytes).\n\nEach memory module added 64 registers, and the calculator could hold up to four of them, for a grand total of 319 registers. While this was considered huge for the time (a little more than 2 [[kilobyte]]s,) all expansion slots were used. User groups found a way to merge two memory chips in a single module, thus freeing two expansion slots. HP designed a module holding all four in one slot, the so-called ''Quad Memory Module''. The later HP-41CV had the quad module built-in.\n\n=== Application pacs ===\nThe [[read-only memory|ROM]]-based application 'pac' modules added up to 4 kilobytes of read-only memory (some up to 8 kilobytes, but these were simply two independent 4K modules in the same box). Most modules held dozens of programs written in the HP-41C programming language, FOCAL.\n\nPrograms in the ROM modules could be called from a user program, using the ubiquitous XEQ function. In the program code, XEQ appeared as \"<tt>XROM</tt>\" when it was used to call a ROM program.\n\n=== 82104A card reader ===\n[[File:1027 - 82104A.jpg|thumb|HP 82104A&nbsp;- card reader/writer]]\n[[File:HP magnetic card.jpg|thumb|HP magnetic card]]\nThe card reader was a device able to read and write small rectangular plastic cards with two magnetic strips. The card reader could copy contents of memory onto magnetic cards, and later read back the data into memory.\n\nAs the HP-41C had [[non-volatile memory]] (user programs and data were not wiped out when power was off) there was no absolute need for a permanent storage device, so the card reader was optional.\n\nEach card held two strips of 112 bytes each, that could hold 16 data registers or up to 112 program steps. This limited capacity resulted in typical programs requiring five or more magnetic cards to be saved. A full backup of the machine's 319 memory registers plus internal data required 11 magnetic cards (each card had to be inserted twice.)\n\nThe card reader could read magnetic cards from the earlier model [[HP-67]]. HP-67 programs were translated into HP-41C instructions, as the HP-67 and HP-41 share the same programming model and operation stack. Some instructions however were specific to the HP-67, and the card reader provided additional instructions to emulate the 67.\n\nMagnetic cards could be write-protected, and programs saved as private: once loaded back, the source code for the program could not be displayed. This made magnetic cards an obvious choice for program distribution.\n\nHowever, the electric motor put a heavy strain on the calculator batteries, and the price tag for blank cards put an even heavier strain on the user's wallet.\n\n=== 82182A time module ===\nThe time module added a real-time clock. The clock allowed use of real-world time in programs. The user could set alarms that triggered calls to user programs. The alarms were able to switch the calculator on, so it was possible to create programs that executed at some point during the day, then switch the calculator off until the next alarm. As the HP-41 was often used as a data-gathering device in labs, this allowed the calculator to read data from monitored devices at specific times every day, without having to remain fully powered up in between readings (thus saving battery capacity).\n\nThe HP-41CX had the time module built in.\n\n=== 82143A thermal printer/plotter ===\nThe printer used rolls of thermal paper to print lines of up to 24 characters. The thermal paper provided for a bluish printout, but was somewhat unstable, as the printout could vanish or the whole paper turn blue due to excessive heat.\n\nThe printer had some graphical capabilities, to allow the user to design character shapes, or even turn on or off individual pixels. However, the buffer memory could not hold sufficient information to print a whole line in graphic mode, and could not alter line spacing, so it was impossible to print continuous graphics in horizontal mode. The printer, nevertheless, provided some printing utilities that were able to graph a function vertically onto the narrow strip of printer paper.\n\n=== 82242A infrared printer interface ===\nInstead of using the aforementioned printer, this module could be used to interface a thermal printer with an infrared interface, namely the [[HP 82240A]] and the [[HP 82240B]]. This allows for on-the-go printing without using cables&nbsp;- but the printer itself needs batteries as well.\n\n=== 82153A optical wand ===\n[[File:HP-WAND.jpg|thumb|HP 82153A&nbsp;- optical wand]]\nThe optical wand was a barcode reader shaped like a thick pen, and was designed to read lines of HP-proprietary standard barcodes into the calculator memory. The barcodes, printed in e.g. HP solutions books, could consist of programs, numeric or alphabetical constants, and even keypresses (letting the calculator be operated without using the keyboard)&nbsp;&mdash; useful for diagnosing calculators where the keyboard was suspected to be faulty.\n\n=== 82180A extended functions module ===\n[[File:HP-41C Extended Functions Memory Module.JPG|thumb|X Functions module 82180A for HP-41C/CV]]\n\nThe Extended Functions module added many functionalities the users had wanted for ages, as the ability to programmatically assign functions to keys, repartition memory, etc.\n\nBut the most important new function was the management of extended memory: while the HP-41C could theoretically access up\nto 1024 registers, the early design limited main memory to 319 registers only. The Extended Functions module added instructions\nto manage a bank of additional memory in the available addressing space of the machine. As this memory was not directly\naddressable by user programs, it was seen as a set of named files containing either programs or data. Programs and data registers could\nbe copied back and forth from the extended memory to the main memory, where they could be accessed as usual.\n\nExtended memory could also hold [[ASCII]] files, and a rudimentary [[text editor]] was added also.\n\nThe Extended Functions module contained 124 registers of Extended memory. More could be added by ... Extended Memory modules.\nThe HP-41CX contained the Extended Functions module as standard.\n\n=== 82181A extended memory module ===\n[[File:0986 - HP41CX X Memory HP82181A.jpg|thumb|X Memory module HP82181A for HP-41CX]]\nExtended memory modules added more extended memory to the HP-41C. They required an extended functions module to be present, or the\nHP-41CX version of the calculator.\n\nEach module added 238 registers of extended memory. Up to two extended memory modules could be inserted, for a grand total of \n124 + 2*238 = 600 registers. Added to the 319 registers of main memory, this covered practically all of the machine's 1024\naddressable registers, for a total of 919 registers, or 6433 bytes.\n\n=== HP82160A HP interface loop (HP-IL) module ===\n''See the main article on [[HP-IL]].''\n\n== {{anchor|DM41|DM41L}}Clones ==\nThe continued popularity of the HP-41CX among users prompted [[SwissMicros]] to produce a miniature calculator approximating the size of an [[ID-1 format|ID-1]] credit card (88&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 59&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 7&nbsp;mm) in 2015. Named ''DM41'', it runs the original HP-41CX firmware with extended memory and realtime clock in an emulator on an [[ARM Cortex-M0]]-based [[NXP]] [[LPC1115]] processor.<ref name=\"SM\"/> Deviating from the original, it comes in a landscape form factor (as known from Hewlett-Packard's [[HP Voyager series|Voyager series]]) with rearranged keys, it features a dot-matrix display, switchable <!-- fonts and -->clock speeds, and, based on a [[Silicon Labs]] CP2102<!-- CP2102 or CP2102N? --> converter chip,<ref name=\"DM15\"/> it comes with a [[USB]] ([[USB Mini-B|Mini-B]]<ref name=\"SM_Serial\"/>) serial interface to exchange data with a PC etc. for backup purposes, to possibly communicate with applications (like PC-based emulators<ref name=\"DM15\"/>), or to update the firmware. In December 2015, SwissMicros introduced the ''DM41L'', a version of the calculator about the same size as the calculators of the [[HP Voyager series]]. It still comes with a USB Mini-B connector.\n\n== Images ==\n<gallery>\n  File:0934 - HP41CX.jpg|Alphanumeric display of a HP-41CX\n  File:0940 - HP-IL.jpg|HP-IL interface module\n  File:0960 1 2 - HP82162A HP41CX.jpg|HP82162A thermal printer (with HP-IL connection)\n  File:0969 70 71 - HP82161A.jpg|HP82161A cassette drive with storage medium (with HP-IL connection)\n  File:0975 6 7 - HP41 Interface Loop.jpg|Interface loop with thermal printer HP82162A (front left), a cassette drive HP82161A (back left) and a HP-41CX\n  File:1033 - HP82163B.jpg|HP 82163B&nbsp;- 32 columns video interface for HP-IL\n  File:0978 - HP41CX Expansion Slots.jpg|Extension slots of a HP-41CX\n  File:0943 - HP82242A IR-Interface.jpg|HP82242A IR-interface (to a thermal printer)\n  File:1027 - 82104A.jpg|HP 82104A&nbsp;- card reader/writer for HP-41C\n  File:0986 - HP41CX X Memory HP82181A.jpg|X Memory module HP82181A (memory extension)\n  File:0992 - HP41CX Stat I.jpg|Statistics module\n  File:1028 - HP82106A.jpg|HP 82106A memory module for HP-41C\n  File:1022 - HP82120A.jpg|HP 82120A battery pack for the HP-41CX with damaged NiCd cells (original)\n  File:0995 - HP41CX Bat Pack.jpg|HP 82120A battery pack for the HP-41CX (the original NiCd cells were replaced by NiMH cells)\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[FOCAL character set]]\n* [[HP calculators]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Coconut\">HP documentation released to the HP-41C hobbyist community in the early 1980s; available at [http://www.hp41.org/LibView.cfm?Command=List&CategoryID=20 HP-41 Internal Documentation].</ref>\n<ref name=\"librach198102\">{{cite journal |author-last=Librach |author-first=Hank |title=Hunt the Wumpus with Your HP-41C |journal=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] |date=February 1981 |pages=230, 232 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n231/mode/2up |access-date=2013-10-18}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"carbrey198012\">{{Cite journal |author-last=Carbrey |author-first=Bruce D. |date=December 1980 |title=A Pocket Computer?
