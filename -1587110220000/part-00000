In Havana he constructed a system for water purification and reconstructed the Gran Teatro.<ref name=\"museoaica.it\"/><ref name=\"smeucci\"/>\n \nIn 1848 his contract with the governor expired. Meucci was asked by a friend's doctors to work on [[Franz Anton Mesmer]]'s therapy system on patients suffering from [[rheumatism]].

On Staten Island he helped several countrymen committed to the Italian unification movement and who had escaped political persecution. Meucci invested the substantial capital he had earned in Cuba into a tallow candle factory (the first of this kind in America) employing several Italian exiles. For two years Meucci hosted friends at his cottage, including General [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], and Colonel Paolo Bovi Campeggi, who arrived in New York two months after Meucci.

He installed a telephone-like device within his house in order to communicate with his wife who was ill at the time.<ref name=\"smeucci\"/> Some of Meucci's notes written in 1857 describe the basic principle of electromagnetic voice transmission or in other words, the telephone:\n\n{{quote|''Consiste in un diaframma vibrante e in un magnete elettrizzato da un filo a spirale che lo avvolge.

His drawing was used to accompany the stamp in a commemorative publication of the Italian Postal and Telegraph Society.<ref name=StampWithDrawingAroundIt/>\n\nMeucci intended to develop his prototype but did not have the financial means to keep his company afloat in order to finance his invention. His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable for anybody to invest.<ref name=\"museoaica.it\"/>\n\n==Bankruptcy==\nAt the same time, Meucci was led to poverty by some fraudulent debtors. On 13 November 1861 his cottage was auctioned. The purchaser allowed the Meuccis to live in the cottage without paying rent, but Meucci's private finances dwindled and he soon had to live on public funds and by depending on his friends.

Their close working friendship continued until 1867.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1870, Meucci reportedly was able to capture a transmission of articulated human voice at the distance of a mile by using a copper plate as a conductor, insulated by cotton. He called this device the \"telettrofono\". While he was recovering from injuries that befell him in a boiler explosion aboard a [[Staten Island Ferry|Staten Island ferry]], the ''Westfield'', Meucci's financial and health state was so bad that his wife sold his drawings and devices to a second-hand dealer to raise money.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Patent caveat==\n<!--this section heading is linked to [[Invention of the telephone]]-->\nOn 12 December 1871 Meucci set up an agreement with Angelo Zilio Grandi (Secretary of the Italian [[Consulate]] in New York), Angelo Antonio Tremeschin ([[entrepreneur]]), Sereno G.P.

It forms a Speaking Telegraph, without the necessity for any hollow tube.\n \nI claim that a portion or the whole of the effect may also be realized by a corresponding arrangement with a metallic tube.  I believe that some metals will serve better than others, but propose to try all kinds of metals.\n \nThe system on which I propose to operate and calculate consists in isolating two persons, separated at considerable distance from each other, by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire.\n \nI believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph, but will experiment on this. Each of these persons holds to his mouth an instrument analogous to a speaking trumpet, in which the word may easily be pronounced, and the sound concentrated upon the wire.  Another instrument is also applied to the ears, in order to receive the voice of the opposite party.\n \nAll these, to wit, the mouth utensil and the ear instruments, communicate to the wire at a short distance from the persons.  The ear utensils being of a convex form, like a clock glass, enclose the whole exterior part of the ear, and make it easy and comfortable for the operator. The object is to bring distinctly to the hearing the word of the person at the opposite end of the telegraph.  \n \nTo call attention, the party at the other end of the line may be warned by an electric telegraph signal, or a series of them.  The apparatus for this purpose, and the skill in operating it, need be much less than for the ordinary telegraphing.\n \nWhen my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should remain alone in their respective rooms, and every practicable precaution should be taken to have the surroundings perfectly quiet. The closed mouth utensil or trumpet, and the enclosing the persons also in a room alone, both tend to prevent undue publicity to the communication.\n \nI think it will be easy, by these means, to prevent the communication being understood by any but the proper persons.\n \nIt may be found practicable to work with the person sending the message insulated, and with the person receiving it, in the free electrical communication with the ground.  Or these conditions may possibly be reversed and still operate with some success.\n \nBoth the conductors or utensils for mouth and ears should be, in fact I must say must be, metallic, and be so conditioned as to be good conductors of electricity.\n \nI claim as my invention, and desire to have considered as such, for all the purposes of this Caveat,\n \nThe new invention herein set forth in all its details, combinations, and sub-combinations.\n \nAnd more especially, I claim\n \nFirst. A continuous sound conductor electrically insulated.\n \nSecond. The same adapted for telegraphing by sound or for conversation between distant parties electrically insulated. \n \nThird. The employment of a sound conductor, which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound between distant points.\n \nFourth. The same in combination with provisions for electrically insulating the sending and receiving parties.\n \nFifth. The mouthpiece or speaking utensil in combination with an electrically insulating conductor.\n \nSixth. The ear utensils or receiving vessels adapted to apply upon the ears in combination with an electrically insulating sound conductor.\n \nSeventh. The entire system, comprising the electrical and sound conductor, insulated and furnished with a mouthpiece and ear pieces at each end, adapted to serve as specified.\n \nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand in presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n \nANTONIO MEUCCI\n\nWitnesses:\n\nShirley McAndrew.\n\nFred'k Harper.\n \nEndorsed:\n\nPatent Office\n\nDec. 28, 1871\n| source = \n| width  = 95%\n| align  = full\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Analysis of Meucci's caveat===\nMeucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat, page 17 top</ref> The mouth piece is like a \"speaking trumpet\" so that \"the sound concentrated upon the wire\" is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\">Caveat page 17</ref> \"Another instrument is also applied to the ears,\" but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\"/> In the third claim, he claims \"a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound\"<ref>Caveat page 18</ref> which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that somehow get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.\"<ref>\"metallic tube\" in Caveat, page 16 bottom.</ref>\n\nMeucci emphasizes that the conductors \"for mouth and ears ... must be metallic\", but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat pages 17 bottom line \u2013 18 top line</ref> He mentions \"communication with the ground\"<ref>Caveat, page 17 bottom.</ref> but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only \"the wire\" (singular, not plural) is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators (\"...{{nbsp}}consists in isolating two persons ... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire\").<ref>Caveat page 17, 3rd paragraph.</ref>\n\nRobert V.

D. Stetson), who filed a caveat on behalf of Meucci with the patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the $250 fee, so all that was prepared was a caveat, since the fee for that was only $20. However, the caveat did not contain a clear description of how the asserted invention would actually function.

Grant, Vice President of American District Telegraph Co. of New York (not [[Western Union]] as sometimes stated), to ask for help. Meucci asked him for permission to test his apparatus on the company's telegraph lines. He gave Grant a description of his prototype and a copy of his caveat. After waiting two years, Meucci went to Grant and asked for his documents back, but Grant allegedly told him they had been lost.<ref name=\"museoaica.it\"/>\n\nAround 1873, a man named Bill Carroll from Boston, who had news about Meucci's invention, asked him to construct a telephone for divers.

Critics dispute the claim that Meucci could not afford to file for a patent or renew his caveat, as he filed for and was granted full patents in 1872, 1873, 1875, and 1876, at the cost of $35 each, as well as one additional $10 patent caveat, all totaling $150, for inventions unrelated to the telephone.<ref name=\"USP&TO\"/><ref name=\"patentmodelassociation.com\"/><ref>Estreich Bob.

Purportedly too poor to hire a legal team, Meucci was represented only by lawyer Joe Melli, an orphan whom Meucci treated as his own son. While ''American Bell Telephone Company v. Globe Telephone Company, Antonio Meucci, et al.'' was still proceeding, Bell also became involved with ''The U.S. Government v. American Bell Telephone Company'', instigated by the Pan-Electric Telephone Company, which had secretly given the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] 10% of its shares, employed him as a director, and then asked him to void Bell's patent.

In the trial, Antonio Meucci was accused of having produced records after Bell's invention and [[back-date]]d them. As proof, the prosecutor brought forward the fact that the Rider & Clark company was founded only in 1863. At trial, Meucci said William E.

During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) of New York.

Tomas Farley also writes that, \"Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys [Bell and Watson] were the first to transmit speech one could understand.\"<ref name=Bellis/>\n\nIn 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"[[Teatro della Pergola]]\" in [[Florence]]. This telephone was constructed on the model of [[Speaking tube|pipe-telephones]] on ships and is still functional.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an [[electroscope]]\u2014which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (talking telegraph).<ref name=\"mam_voce\"/>{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone\u2014such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], and others\u2014he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the \"make-and-break\" method). Instead, he looked for a \"continuous\" solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium [[dichromate]] and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMeucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so-called \"local effect\"\u2014using what we would call today a four-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short-circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses (clicks) that were louder than normal conversation.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron).{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device \"telettrofono\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others (the court's findings, reported in 31 Fed. Rep. 729).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nN. Herbert in his ''History of the Telephone'' said:\n\n{{quote|To bait the Bell Company became almost a national sport.

On Staten Island he helped several countrymen committed to the Italian unification movement and who had escaped political persecution.

It forms a Speaking Telegraph, without the necessity for any hollow tube.\n \nI claim that a portion or the whole of the effect may also be realized by a corresponding arrangement with a metallic tube.  I believe that some metals will serve better than others, but propose to try all kinds of metals.\n \nThe system on which I propose to operate and calculate consists in isolating two persons, separated at considerable distance from each other, by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire.\n \nI believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph, but will experiment on this. Each of these persons holds to his mouth an instrument analogous to a speaking trumpet, in which the word may easily be pronounced, and the sound concentrated upon the wire.  Another instrument is also applied to the ears, in order to receive the voice of the opposite party.\n \nAll these, to wit, the mouth utensil and the ear instruments, communicate to the wire at a short distance from the persons.  The ear utensils being of a convex form, like a clock glass, enclose the whole exterior part of the ear, and make it easy and comfortable for the operator. The object is to bring distinctly to the hearing the word of the person at the opposite end of the telegraph.  \n \nTo call attention, the party at the other end of the line may be warned by an electric telegraph signal, or a series of them.  The apparatus for this purpose, and the skill in operating it, need be much less than for the ordinary telegraphing.\n \nWhen my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should remain alone in their respective rooms, and every practicable precaution should be taken to have the surroundings perfectly quiet. The closed mouth utensil or trumpet, and the enclosing the persons also in a room alone, both tend to prevent undue publicity to the communication.\n \nI think it will be easy, by these means, to prevent the communication being understood by any but the proper persons.\n \nIt may be found practicable to work with the person sending the message insulated, and with the person receiving it, in the free electrical communication with the ground.  Or these conditions may possibly be reversed and still operate with some success.\n \nBoth the conductors or utensils for mouth and ears should be, in fact I must say must be, metallic, and be so conditioned as to be good conductors of electricity.\n \nI claim as my invention, and desire to have considered as such, for all the purposes of this Caveat,\n \nThe new invention herein set forth in all its details, combinations, and sub-combinations.\n \nAnd more especially, I claim\n \nFirst. A continuous sound conductor electrically insulated.\n \nSecond. The same adapted for telegraphing by sound or for conversation between distant parties electrically insulated. \n \nThird. The employment of a sound conductor, which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound between distant points.\n \nFourth. The same in combination with provisions for electrically insulating the sending and receiving parties.\n \nFifth. The mouthpiece or speaking utensil in combination with an electrically insulating conductor.\n \nSixth. The ear utensils or receiving vessels adapted to apply upon the ears in combination with an electrically insulating sound conductor.\n \nSeventh. The entire system, comprising the electrical and sound conductor, insulated and furnished with a mouthpiece and ear pieces at each end, adapted to serve as specified.\n \nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand in presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n \nANTONIO MEUCCI\n\nWitnesses:\n\nShirley McAndrew.\n\nFred'k Harper.\n \nEndorsed:\n\nPatent Office\n\nDec. 28, 1871\n| source = \n| width  = 95%\n| align  = full\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Analysis of Meucci's caveat===\nMeucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat, page 17 top</ref> The mouth piece is like a \"speaking trumpet\" so that \"the sound concentrated upon the wire\" is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\">Caveat page 17</ref> \"Another instrument is also applied to the ears,\" but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\"/> In the third claim, he claims \"a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound\"<ref>Caveat page 18</ref> which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that somehow get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.\"<ref>\"metallic tube\" in Caveat, page 16 bottom.</ref>\n\nMeucci emphasizes that the conductors \"for mouth and ears ... must be metallic\", but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat pages 17 bottom line \u2013 18 top line</ref> He mentions \"communication with the ground\"<ref>Caveat, page 17 bottom.</ref> but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only \"the wire\" (singular, not plural) is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators (\"...{{nbsp}}consists in isolating two persons ... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire\").<ref>Caveat page 17, 3rd paragraph.</ref>\n\nRobert V.

The [[:it:Associazione Elettrotecnica|Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica]] has devoted a museum to Meucci making a chronology of his inventing the telephone and tracing the history of the two trials opposing Meucci and Bell.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusione], aei.it. {{in lang|it}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206035330/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm |date=6 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm Museo Storico Virtuale dell'AEIT Sala Antonio Meucci], aei.it. {{in lang|it}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510071411/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm |date=10 May 2006 }}</ref> They support the claim that Antonio Meucci was the real inventor of the telephone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci_faq.htm#6|title=Antonio Meucci \u2013 Questions and Answers|website=www.chezbasilio.org}}</ref>\nHowever, some scholars outside Italy do not recognize the claims that Meucci's device had any bearing on the development of the telephone. Tomas Farley also writes that, \"Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys [Bell and Watson] were the first to transmit speech one could understand.\"<ref name=Bellis/>\n\nIn 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"[[Teatro della Pergola]]\" in [[Florence]]. This telephone was constructed on the model of [[Speaking tube|pipe-telephones]] on ships and is still functional.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an [[electroscope]]\u2014which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (talking telegraph).<ref name=\"mam_voce\"/>{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone\u2014such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], and others\u2014he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the \"make-and-break\" method). Instead, he looked for a \"continuous\" solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium [[dichromate]] and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMeucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so-called \"local effect\"\u2014using what we would call today a four-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short-circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses (clicks) that were louder than normal conversation.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron).{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device \"telettrofono\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others (the court's findings, reported in 31 Fed. Rep. 729).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nN. Herbert in his ''History of the Telephone'' said:\n\n{{quote|To bait the Bell Company became almost a national sport. Any sort of claimant, with any sort of wild tale of prior invention, could find a speculator to support him. On they came, a motley array, 'some in rags, some on nags, and some in velvet gowns.' One of them claimed to have done wonders with an iron hoop and a file in 1867; a second had a marvellous table with glass legs; a third swore that he had made a telephone in 1860, but did not know what it was until he saw Bell's patent; and a fourth told a vivid story of having heard a bullfrog croak via a telegraph wire which was strung into a certain cellar in Racine, in 1851.<ref>Casson, Herbert N.

It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic, it may derive from 'Aille' literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful place or valley<ref>The Place names of Elginshire by Donald Matheson. Pg.139</ref>. Another possibility is 'ealg', meaning both 'Ireland' and 'worthy'.<ref>Mackay, George, 2000. Scottish Place Names</ref> The termination 'gin' or 'in' are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence Elgin could mean beautiful place, worthy place or little Ireland.\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

Graves|pages=193\u2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe cathedral is known as the ''Lantern of the North.'' When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

8460</small>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{for|economy of Moray|Moray}}\n\nThe Elgin \u2013 Forres \u2013 Lossiemouth triangle is heavily dependent on [[Royal Air Force]] stations for the employment of civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

These wards are Elgin North and Elgin South.\n\n==Transport==\nElgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations. Elgin's bus station is operated mainly by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], and provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness. There is a 'Jet' bus service which runs to the [[Inverness Airport]] at Dalcross, Inverness has flights to mainly UK destinations while [[Aberdeen Airport]] has UK and international flights.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Elgin, Gordon Street, Moray College Of Further Education.jpg|thumb|Moray School of Art]]\n\n===Nursery schools===\n* Ark Childcare, Mosstowie\n* Jack 'n' Jill Pre-School Centre, Kinder House, 22 Wardend Place, New Elgin\n* Moray Leisure Centre Pre-School Nursery, Borough Briggs Road, Elgin\n* Magic Roundabout Pre-School Nursery, Thornhill Drive, Elgin\n*St Sylvesters Nursery\n*Bishopmill Nursery\n*Seafield Nursery\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Bishopmill Primary School, Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* East End Primary School, Institution Road\n* Greenwards Primary School, Edgar Road, New Elgin\n* New Elgin Primary School, Bezack Street, New Elgin\n* Seafield Primary School, Deanshaugh Terrace, Bishopmill\n* West End Primary School, Mayne Road\n* St Sylvester's RC Primary School, Abbey Street\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]], Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* [[Elgin High School (Scotland)|Elgin High School]], High School Drive, New Elgin\n\n===Further education===\n* [[Moray College]], Moray Street, Elgin, Moray\n\n==Community care==\n\n===Hospitals===\n* [[Dr Gray's Hospital]]\n\n===Health centres===\n* The Maryhill Health Centre.\n* Linkwood Medical at the Glassgreen Centre (Formerly the Victoria Crescet Medical Centre before its relocation in 2009)\n* Elgin Community Surgery, Highfield House.\n\n===Hospice===\n* [[The Oaks, Elgin|The Oaks Hospice]], Sherrifmill\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Elgin.jpg|thumb|St Giles church in Elgin's town centre]]\n\nThe following denominations have places of worship in Elgin:\n\n'''[[Church of Scotland]]'''\n* St Giles', High Street\n* St Columba's South, Moss Street\n* Birnie Kirk, A941, Elgin \n* Elgin High, North Guildry Street\n'''[[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]'''\n* Free Church, South Street\n'''[[Baptist Union of Scotland]]'''\n* Elgin Baptist Church, Reidhaven Street<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070125003856/http://www.elginbaptistchurch.co.uk/ Elgin Baptist Church]</ref>\n'''Roman Catholic Church'''\n* St Sylvester's, Institution Road\n* [[Greyfriars Sisters of Mercy Convent in Elgin]]\n'''[[Scottish Episcopal Church]]'''\n* Holy Trinity, Trinity Place<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729093237/http://www.episcopalmoray.org.uk/elgin.htm Holy Trinity]</ref>\n'''Other denominations'''\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Pansport Road\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Linkwood\n* Calvary Christian Life Centre, Lesmurdie Road\n* [[True Jesus Church]], Lesmurdie Road\n* [[Pentecostal Church of God]], New Elgin Hall Annex\n* [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]], Riverside Gospel Hall, North Street\n* Oasis Church COTN, The Hub, Tyock Industrial Estate<ref>[http://www.oasischurchelgin.co.uk/ Oasis Church]</ref>\n\n== Culture and leisure==\n* Elgin Museum, 1 High Street\n* Elgin Library, Cooper Park\n* Elgin Golf Club, Hardhillock, Birnie Road\n* Glassgreen Golf Range, Birnie Road\n* Cooper Park: boating, pitch and putt, tennis\n* Biblical Gardens\n* Moray Leisure Centre, Borough Briggs Road, containing swimming pool, ice rink and a gymnasium\n*Moray Sports Centre, Linkwood\n* Town Hall with auditorium for production of shows\n* Community Centre, Trinity Road: badminton\n* The Lantern Gallery, 18 South Guildry Street\n* Red Shoes Theatre and music venue, High Street\n* Elgin Youth Caf\u00e9, Francis Place\n* Moray Jazz Club, ground floor of the Elgin City Football Club, Borough Briggs Road\n\n==Music==\nDuring the 1960s [[The Beatles]], [[The Who]], [[Pink Floyd]],<ref>[http://tworedshoes.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/pink-floyd-ttrs.jpg Image of Two Red Shoes Ballroom poster featuring Pink Floyd]</ref> [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] all performed at the Two Red Shoes dancehall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1963/01/03/live-two-red-shoes-ballroom-elgin-scotland |title=Two Red Shoes Ballroom, Elgin, Scotland |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date=1963-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html \"Red Shoes future in doubt\"], Northern Scot  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002629/http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html |date=27 July 2010 }}</ref> and [[The Kinks]] played Elgin Town Hall.

It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic. It may derive from 'Aille' literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful place or valley<ref>The Place names of Elginshire by Donald Matheson. Pg.139</ref>, another possibility is 'ealg', meaning both 'Ireland' and 'worthy'.<ref>Mackay, George, 2000. Scottish Place Names</ref>. The termination 'gin' or 'in' are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence Elgin could mean beautiful place, worthy place or little Ireland.\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

Graves|pages=193\u2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe cathedral is known as the ''Lantern of the North.'' When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

These wards are Elgin North and Elgin South.\n\n==Transport==\nElgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations. Elgin's bus station is operated mainly by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], and provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness. There is a 'Jet' bus service which runs to the [[Inverness Airport]] at Dalcross, Inverness has flights to mainly UK destinations while [[Aberdeen Airport]] has UK and international flights.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Elgin, Gordon Street, Moray College Of Further Education.jpg|thumb|Moray School of Art]]\n\n===Nursery schools===\n* Ark Childcare, Mosstowie\n* Jack 'n' Jill Pre-School Centre, Kinder House, 22 Wardend Place, New Elgin\n* Moray Leisure Centre Pre-School Nursery, Borough Briggs Road, Elgin\n* Magic Roundabout Pre-School Nursery, Thornhill Drive, Elgin\n*St Sylvesters Nursery\n*Bishopmill Nursery\n*Seafield Nursery\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Bishopmill Primary School, Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* East End Primary School, Institution Road\n* Greenwards Primary School, Edgar Road, New Elgin\n* New Elgin Primary School, Bezack Street, New Elgin\n* Seafield Primary School, Deanshaugh Terrace, Bishopmill\n* West End Primary School, Mayne Road\n* St Sylvester's RC Primary School, Abbey Street\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]], Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* [[Elgin High School (Scotland)|Elgin High School]], High School Drive, New Elgin\n\n===Further education===\n* [[Moray College]], Moray Street, Elgin, Moray\n\n==Community care==\n\n===Hospitals===\n* [[Dr Gray's Hospital]]\n\n===Health centres===\n* The Maryhill Health Centre.\n* Linkwood Medical at the Glassgreen Centre (Formerly the Victoria Crescet Medical Centre before its relocation in 2009)\n* Elgin Community Surgery, Highfield House.\n\n===Hospice===\n* [[The Oaks, Elgin|The Oaks Hospice]], Sherrifmill\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Elgin.jpg|thumb|St Giles church in Elgin's town centre]]\n\nThe following denominations have places of worship in Elgin:\n\n'''[[Church of Scotland]]'''\n* St Giles', High Street\n* St Columba's South, Moss Street\n* Birnie Kirk, A941, Elgin \n* Elgin High, North Guildry Street\n'''[[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]'''\n* Free Church, South Street\n'''[[Baptist Union of Scotland]]'''\n* Elgin Baptist Church, Reidhaven Street<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070125003856/http://www.elginbaptistchurch.co.uk/ Elgin Baptist Church]</ref>\n'''Roman Catholic Church'''\n* St Sylvester's, Institution Road\n* [[Greyfriars Sisters of Mercy Convent in Elgin]]\n'''[[Scottish Episcopal Church]]'''\n* Holy Trinity, Trinity Place<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729093237/http://www.episcopalmoray.org.uk/elgin.htm Holy Trinity]</ref>\n'''Other denominations'''\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Pansport Road\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Linkwood\n* Calvary Christian Life Centre, Lesmurdie Road\n* [[True Jesus Church]], Lesmurdie Road\n* [[Pentecostal Church of God]], New Elgin Hall Annex\n* [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]], Riverside Gospel Hall, North Street\n* Oasis Church COTN, The Hub, Tyock Industrial Estate<ref>[http://www.oasischurchelgin.co.uk/ Oasis Church]</ref>\n\n== Culture and leisure==\n* Elgin Museum, 1 High Street\n* Elgin Library, Cooper Park\n* Elgin Golf Club, Hardhillock, Birnie Road\n* Glassgreen Golf Range, Birnie Road\n* Cooper Park: boating, pitch and putt, tennis\n* Biblical Gardens\n* Moray Leisure Centre, Borough Briggs Road, containing swimming pool, ice rink and a gymnasium\n*Moray Sports Centre, Linkwood\n* Town Hall with auditorium for production of shows\n* Community Centre, Trinity Road: badminton\n* The Lantern Gallery, 18 South Guildry Street\n* Red Shoes Theatre and music venue, High Street\n* Elgin Youth Caf\u00e9, Francis Place\n* Moray Jazz Club, ground floor of the Elgin City Football Club, Borough Briggs Road\n\n==Music==\nDuring the 1960s [[The Beatles]], [[The Who]], [[Pink Floyd]],<ref>[http://tworedshoes.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/pink-floyd-ttrs.jpg Image of Two Red Shoes Ballroom poster featuring Pink Floyd]</ref> [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] all performed at the Two Red Shoes dancehall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1963/01/03/live-two-red-shoes-ballroom-elgin-scotland |title=Two Red Shoes Ballroom, Elgin, Scotland |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date=1963-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html \"Red Shoes future in doubt\"], Northern Scot  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002629/http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html |date=27 July 2010 }}</ref> and [[The Kinks]] played Elgin Town Hall.

These hard-working arrivals influenced the tastes of a nation \u2013 in the arts, dance, religion, food. Oranjehof tells those eye-opening stories in interactive ways, which include digital displays and hands-on games. \n\nThe history of the Dutch in Aotearoa goes all the way back to Tasman's arrival in 1642, some 127 years before Captain Cook<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman</ref>.\n\n== Oranjehof Museum ==\n[[File:Kunst - Art and design.jpg|thumb|Kunst - Art and design]]\nOranjehof is a museum that is quintessential Dutch, with a colourful sense of humour of its own, plenty of gezelligheid, and a sense of clear Dutch design. \n\nDutch artists represented, include photographer [http://suite.co.nz/answestra Ans Westra], sculptor [http://www.gibbsfarm.org.nz/vandeneijkel.php Leon van den Eijkel]<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_van_den_Eijkel</ref>, and ceramicists [https://www.cordys.co.nz/auctions/Z12/catalogue Anneke Borren] and [http://www.newzealandpottery.net/t3512-melis-van-der-sluis Melis van der Sluis].

The battalions of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment fought in the [[Middle East]], [[North African Campaign]], [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Persia]], [[Battle of Malaya]], [[Battle of Singapore]] and [[Burma Campaign]].<ref name=\"History of the Kumaon Regiment\"/>\n\nThe Kumaon Rifles were based in [[Hong Kong]] at the beginning of the [[Second World War]] but were transferred to the Middle East as part of the [[24th Indian Infantry Brigade]].

They remained in Persia as part of the garrison throughout the rest of the war.<ref name=\"The Kumaon Rifles in WW2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=9686&Tab=Sup|title=Orders of Battle.com|last=Gardner|first=Brian|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe 4th Battalion was part of the [[12th Indian Infantry Brigade]] based in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] when the Japanese Army invaded in December 1941. The 4/19th Hyderabads were one of the few battalions in Malaya that were relatively well trained in jungle warfare. Although the battalion performed well in the fighting retreat in north-west Malaya, they were practically annihilated at the disastrous [[Battle of Slim River]] on 7 January 1942. The few survivors of the 4th Battalion were withdrawn to [[Singapore]] where they took part in the brief [[Battle of Singapore|defence of the island]] before it surrendered on 15 February 1942.\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48===\n1 and 4 Kumaon was dispatched to [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to participate in the defence of Srinigar. 4 Kumaon elements were decisive in the [[Battle of Badgam]].\n\n===Sino-Indian War of 1962===\n====Battle of Walong====\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{{POV|date=January 2017}}\n}}\nThis was the only battle of the war in which an [[India]]n unit attacked the Chinese, rather than defending. On 14 November 1962, 6 Kumaon attacked and captured Chinese defenses in the Walong sector, [[Arunachal Pradesh]], without any [[artillery]] or aerial support.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe Chinese retaliated with artillery and multiple [[human wave attacks]]. The Kumaonis were vastly outnumbered by over 10 to 1, but held their ground and repulsed every attack until all their ammunition was exhausted, without any logistical support. They then engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and fought to the last man and bullet. Five times as many Chinese soldiers died in the [[battle]]. The [[China|Chinese]] succeeded in retaking the defences when there was no Kumaoni left standing.\n\nFive [[Vir Chakra]]s were awarded to [[soldiers]] from 6 Kumaon for their actions in the battle; the battalion celebrates 14 November as Walong Day.\n\n====Battle of Rezang La====\n120 men of C Company of 13 Kumaon, commanded by Maj. [[Shaitan Singh]], made a [[last stand]] at the [[Rezang La]] pass on 18 November 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/dont-forget-the-heroes-of-rezang-la/article4112584.ece|title=Don\u2019t forget the heroes of Rezang La|author=Mohan Guruswamy|work=The Hindu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe area assigned to C Company was defended by three [[platoon]] positions, but the surrounding terrain isolated 13 Kumaon from the rest of the regiment. The Indian artillery was located behind a hill feature blocking the line of fire so the infantry had to fight the battle without artillery support. The Chinese suffered no such disadvantage and brought heavy artillery fire upon C Company.\n\nThe Chinese attack, which was expected, came through a dry [[river]] bed. It was repulsed with heavy [[machine gun]] fire by the Indian soldiers. The Chinese regrouped and attacked persistently with more reinforcements. Maj. Shaitan Singh went from post to post raising the morale of his men and continued to fight even after being seriously wounded. Of C Company's 120 troops, 114 men were martyred, Of the 6 survivors, 5 were severely injured and captured by the Chinese. A memorial in [[Rewari]] claims that 1,300 Chinese soldiers were killed in the battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/-nobody-believed-we-had-killed-so-many-chinese-at-rezang-la.-our-commander-called-me-crazy-and-warned-that-i-could-be-courtmartialled-/1023745/0|title=\u2018Nobody believed we had killed so many Chinese at Rezang La.

On 7 September, 9 Kumaon, under the command of Capt. V.K. Bogra, further advanced and captured Maharajke. Nk. Ganesh Dutt of 9 Kumaon was awarded the Vir Chakra for his role in capturing Maharjke against Pakistani defenses.\n\n====Battle of Chhamb====\nTo preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half. On 2 September, the battalion was ordered to withdraw after they had destroyed four Pakistani tanks. One Vir Chakra was awarded for the action.\n\n===Indo-Pakistan War of 1971===\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistan War of 1971}}\nKumaon battalions were deployed and fought on both the Eastern and the Western fronts during the war.<ref name=kumaon-1971>{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp16P31C.aspx?MnId=xkFw09/aom0=&ParentID=1/O4fj0Mcdg=|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Meghdoot===\n{{Main|Siachen Conflict}}\nThe Indian Army's initiative to hold the [[Siachen Glacier]] consisted of units of the Kumaon Regiment and the [[Ladakh Scouts]]. It was led by Maj. R.S. Sandhu, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for his leadership. Capt. Sanjay Kulkarni's unit was the first to land on [[Bilafond La]] and hoist the Indian tricolour.

Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across [[Zoji La]], through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier.\n\n19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100&nbsp;km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.<ref>Gorichen to Siachen, The Untold Saga of Hoisting the Tricolour on Saltoro By Brig DK Khanna, VSM -{{ISBN|978-93-86367-10-5}} Publisher Alpha Editions, Chapter 16, Page 116</ref>\n\nNk. (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the [[Shaurya Chakra]] for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.\n\n===Operation Pawan===\n{{Main|Operation Pawan}}\nKumaon units were deployed to [[Sri Lanka]] during [[Operation Pawan]]. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in [[Jaffna]] at the Palali airfield.<ref name=\"kumaon-op\"/> It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to [[Mallakam]]. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured.\n\nAnother battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the [[Trincomalee]] Sector. Among the areas in which Kumaon units were deployed and operated included Kilividdi of Muttur Sector, [[Sampur, Trincomalee|Sampur]], Vellvutturai and [[Point Pedro]].\n\n===Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nKumaon units were deployed during [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] to oust Pakistan Army regulars who had infiltrated the [[Kargil district|Kargil]] sector in [[Ladakh]] posing as insurgents.

In addition, two battalions known as the Elichpur Brigade, were raised by Nawab Salabat Khan, Subedar of Berar, as a part of the Nizam's forces. The men of the Russell Brigade were chiefly [[Hindu]]s, recruited from [[Oudh]] and other parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]].

Over time, the class composition changed to Kumaonis and Ahirs.<ref name=\"IndArmy\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a Kumaon battalion was raised at [[Ranikhet]] on 23 October 1917 as 4/39th Kumaon Rifles. In 1918, it was redesignated as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was raised. These were merged with the Hyderabad Contingent into the [[19th Hyderabad Regiment]] in 1923. The first battalion of the 50th Kumaon Rifles survived to become the 1st Kumaon Rifles, and is today the 3rd Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (Rifles) of the Indian Army. Some units of the Berar and Elichpur infantry were demobilized after World War I.

A 2nd Battalion was also raised in 1918 but disbanded in 1923. The Hyderabad Contingent, with its mixed Kumaoni, Jats, [[Ahir]]s and Deccan Muslims, continued and fought with distinction in the Great War. In 1922, during the Indian Army reorganisation, the six regiments of the Hyderabad Contingent were renamed as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment and infantry companies formed from the Kumaon region replaced many of the Deccan Muslim-based companies.

The 4/19th Hyderabads were one of the few battalions in Malaya that were relatively well trained in jungle warfare. Although the battalion performed well in the fighting retreat in north-west Malaya, they were practically annihilated at the disastrous [[Battle of Slim River]] on 7 January 1942. The few survivors of the 4th Battalion were withdrawn to [[Singapore]] where they took part in the brief [[Battle of Singapore|defence of the island]] before it surrendered on 15 February 1942.\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48===\n1 and 4 Kumaon was dispatched to [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to participate in the defence of Srinigar. 4 Kumaon elements were decisive in the [[Battle of Badgam]].\n\n===Sino-Indian War of 1962===\n====Battle of Walong====\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{{POV|date=January 2017}}\n}}\nThis was the only battle of the war in which an [[India]]n unit attacked the Chinese, rather than defending.

The Kumaonis were vastly outnumbered by over 10 to 1, but held their ground and repulsed every attack until all their ammunition was exhausted, without any logistical support. They then engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and fought to the last man and bullet. Five times as many Chinese soldiers died in the [[battle]]. The [[China|Chinese]] succeeded in retaking the defences when there was no Kumaoni left standing.\n\nFive [[Vir Chakra]]s were awarded to [[soldiers]] from 6 Kumaon for their actions in the battle; the battalion celebrates 14 November as Walong Day.\n\n====Battle of Rezang La====\n120 men of C Company of 13 Kumaon, commanded by Maj.

The Indian artillery was located behind a hill feature blocking the line of fire so the infantry had to fight the battle without artillery support. The Chinese suffered no such disadvantage and brought heavy artillery fire upon C Company.\n\nThe Chinese attack, which was expected, came through a dry [[river]] bed. It was repulsed with heavy [[machine gun]] fire by the Indian soldiers. The Chinese regrouped and attacked persistently with more reinforcements. Maj. Shaitan Singh went from post to post raising the morale of his men and continued to fight even after being seriously wounded. Of C Company's 120 troops, 114 men were martyred, Of the 6 survivors, 5 were severely injured and captured by the Chinese.

On 7 September, 9 Kumaon, under the command of Capt. V.K. Bogra, further advanced and captured Maharajke. Nk. Ganesh Dutt of 9 Kumaon was awarded the Vir Chakra for his role in capturing Maharjke against Pakistani defenses.\n\n====Battle of Chhamb====\nTo preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half.

Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across [[Zoji La]], through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier.\n\n19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100&nbsp;km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.<ref>Gorichen to Siachen, The Untold Saga of Hoisting the Tricolour on Saltoro By Brig DK Khanna, VSM -{{ISBN|978-93-86367-10-5}} Publisher Alpha Editions, Chapter 16, Page 116</ref>\n\nNk. (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the [[Shaurya Chakra]] for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.\n\n===Operation Pawan===\n{{Main|Operation Pawan}}\nKumaon units were deployed to [[Sri Lanka]] during [[Operation Pawan]]. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in [[Jaffna]] at the Palali airfield.<ref name=\"kumaon-op\"/> It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to [[Mallakam]]. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured.\n\nAnother battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the [[Trincomalee]] Sector.

Most of the toys are a variety of foam-based weaponry, with other Nerf products including balls for sports like [[American football]], basketball and baseball. The most notable of the toys are the dart guns (referred to by Hasbro as \"blasters\") that shoot ammunition made from Nerf foam. Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball. The slogan, which has been frequently used since advertising in the 1990s, is ''\"It's Nerf or Nothin'!\"''.

They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters.

The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front.

This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts.  Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length.  They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |title=Parents, Beware: Nerf\u2019s Newest Blasters Won\u2019t Fire Knockoff Darts |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2019-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |archive-date=2019-10-03 |url-status=live }}https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |date=2019-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe first blaster in the Ultra line was the Nerf Ultra ''One'', a drum-fed (25-dart capacity), flywheel design with integral (non-detachable) stock and fixed barrel with no N-Strike barrel attachments. It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side.
