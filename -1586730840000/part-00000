[Bob] Weir didn't like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/> Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.\n\n===Career with the Grateful Dead===\n[[File:Jerry Garcia 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jerry Garcia in 1969]]\nGarcia served as lead guitarist, as well as one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for its entire career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/hole-notes-acoustic-stylings-late-jerry-garcia|title=The Acoustic Stylings of the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia|work=Guitar World|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-us}}</ref> Garcia composed such songs as \"[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\">{{cite web|url=http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/|title=The Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics|accessdate=July 12, 2007|year=2007|author=Dodd, David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404063019/http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Franklin's Tower\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> and \"[[Scarlet Begonias]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> among many others.

His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/> Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist [[Bob Weir]], remarking that \"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and [[Chuck Berry]]), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com.

Garcia was also a fan of [[jazz]] artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played [[pedal steel guitar]] for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with [[Bob Dylan]] in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, [[Pete Sears]], who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, [[Mickey Hart]] and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a [[Grateful Dead]] show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and [[Pete Sears]] at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery<ref>Jerry Garcia, Collected Artwork, pp.176\u2013177</ref> in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Years after Garcia's death, his estate granted the license to Mulberry Street which resulted in a lawsuit and settlement with the original manufacturer, and new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold.\n\n==Personal life==\nGarcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal Garcia, in 1963.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> She was working at the coffee house in the back of [[Kepler's Books]], where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed.

She died on September 28, 1970.\n\nIn the midst of a March 1973 Grateful Dead engagement at the [[Nassau Coliseum]] near New York City, Garcia met Deborah Koons, an aspiring filmmaker from a wealthy [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]-based family who would much later marry him and become his widow.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|2000|p=259}}</ref><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> After a brief correspondence, he began his relationship with her in mid-1974; this gradually strained his relationship with Adams and culminated in Garcia leaving Adams for Koons in late 1975. The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household; however, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area (near Kesey) in 1978. Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore (a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\" and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen) circa 1980\u20131981, and their brief liaison inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \"Run for the Roses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://insiderlouisville.com/lifestyle_culture/grateful-dead-manager-rock-scullys-louisville-years/ | title=Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully's Louisville years | first=David | last=Serchuk | work=Insider Louisville | date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdams and Garcia were married (largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies) on December 31, 1981. Despite the legal codification of their union, she remained in Oregon while Garcia continued to live near the Grateful Dead's offices in [[San Rafael, California]] with a variety of housemates, including band publicist/Jerry Garcia Band manager [[Rock Scully]] (who was dismissed by the group in 1984 for enabling Garcia's addictions and allegedly embezzling the Garcia Band's profits) and Nora Sage, a housekeeper and law student who served as Garcia's platonic companion at the nadir of his opiate addiction and later became his art representative.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Day of the Dead: From Hotel Suites to Wet Suits, Jerry Garcia's Art Is Becoming an Empire| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-14/news/ls-42434_1_jerry-garcia| last=Lacher| first=Irene| date=March 14, 1995| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> After briefly reuniting following his diabetic coma, Garcia and Adams officially divorced in 1994.

Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], who abstained from all drugs as a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAccording to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of [[cocaine]] accelerated throughout the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkavBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cocaine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhMfr9IbPAhWB6iYKHbpCDWEQ6AEIPzAG#v=snippet&q=%22cocaine%22&f=false | title=Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead | first1=Bill | last1=Kreutzmann | first2=Benjy | last2=Eisen | date=2015 | publisher=Macmillan | accessdate=May 5, 2017 | via=Google Books}}</ref> After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined [[opium]]) colloquially known as \"Persian\" or \"Persian Base\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and [[Bruce Hornsby]]. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited [[Phil Lesh]] over to his home in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Aces Back to Back: The History of the Grateful Dead (1965\u20132013) | first=Scott W. | last=Allen | date=2014 | publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc. | isbn=978-1-4787-1943-4 | page=135}}</ref> Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight.

In March and April 1971 \u2013 the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Grateful Dead'']] \u2013 Garcia played the \"Peanut,\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rickturnerblog.com/2017/12/05/garcias-turner-peanut-guitar/ |title=Garcia's Turner \"Peanut Guitar\" |last=Turner |first=Rick |date=December 17, 2017 |website=rickturnerblog.com |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by [[Graham Nash]].

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil [[DiMarzio]] SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a [[rose]], covers a plate just below the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ({{inflation|US|11000|1990|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"rosebud\"/>\n\nIn 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.<ref name=\"guithis\"/> After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay.<ref name=\"lightbolt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitar/Bolt.html|title=The Lightning Bolt guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to \"wing it.\"<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/>\n\nCripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name Top Hat. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.\n\nAfter Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question.

Around this time, the psychedelic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: \"Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it for it to be shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/>\n\nIn 1965, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the Warlocks, with the addition of Phil Lesh on bass guitar and [[Bill Kreutzmann]] on [[Drum kit|percussion]]. However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the [[Velvet Underground]]) had recently selected the same name. In response, Garcia came up with \"Grateful Dead\" by opening a [[Funk & Wagnalls]] dictionary to an entry for \"[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful dead]]\".<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> The definition for \"Grateful dead\" was \"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\".<ref>Stories about the \"Grateful Dead\" appear in many cultures.</ref> The band's first reaction was disapproval.<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and [[Chuck Berry]]), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com.

Garcia was also a fan of [[jazz]] artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played [[pedal steel guitar]] for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with [[Bob Dylan]] in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, [[Pete Sears]], who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, [[Mickey Hart]] and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a [[Grateful Dead]] show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and [[Pete Sears]] at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery<ref>Jerry Garcia, Collected Artwork, pp.176\u2013177</ref> in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Years after Garcia's death, his estate granted the license to Mulberry Street which resulted in a lawsuit and settlement with the original manufacturer, and new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold.\n\n==Personal life==\nGarcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal Garcia, in 1963.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> She was working at the coffee house in the back of [[Kepler's Books]], where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed.

The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household; however, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area (near Kesey) in 1978. Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore (a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\" and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen) circa 1980\u20131981, and their brief liaison inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \"Run for the Roses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://insiderlouisville.com/lifestyle_culture/grateful-dead-manager-rock-scullys-louisville-years/ | title=Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully's Louisville years | first=David | last=Serchuk | work=Insider Louisville | date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdams and Garcia were married (largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies) on December 31, 1981.

On October 2, 1967, 710 Ashbury Street in San Francisco (where the Grateful Dead had taken up residence the year before) was raided after a police [[Informant|tip-off]].<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan were apprehended on marijuana charges which were later dropped, although Garcia himself was not arrested.<ref name=\"ew-svetky-03-93\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305844,00.html | title=The essential Grateful Dead History | last=Svetkey | first=Benjamin | date=March 12, 1993 | work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=September 21, 2009}}</ref> The following year, Garcia's picture was used in a campaign commercial for [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1968/youth \"Youth\"], Nixon campaign ad (at 0:12)</ref>\n\nMost of the band were arrested again in January 1970, after they flew to New Orleans from Hawaii.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> After returning to their hotel from a performance, the band checked into their rooms, only to be quickly raided by police. Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], who abstained from all drugs as a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAccording to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of [[cocaine]] accelerated throughout the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkavBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cocaine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhMfr9IbPAhWB6iYKHbpCDWEQ6AEIPzAG#v=snippet&q=%22cocaine%22&f=false | title=Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead | first1=Bill | last1=Kreutzmann | first2=Benjy | last2=Eisen | date=2015 | publisher=Macmillan | accessdate=May 5, 2017 | via=Google Books}}</ref> After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined [[opium]]) colloquially known as \"Persian\" or \"Persian Base\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and [[Bruce Hornsby]]. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited [[Phil Lesh]] over to his home in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Aces Back to Back: The History of the Grateful Dead (1965\u20132013) | first=Scott W. | last=Allen | date=2014 | publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc. | isbn=978-1-4787-1943-4 | page=135}}</ref> Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight.

Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. \n\nIn light of his second drug relapse and current condition, Garcia checked himself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] during July 1995. His stay was limited, lasting only two weeks.

Beginning in late 1967 and ending in 1968, Garcia played black or gold mid-1950s [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitars with [[P-90]] pickups. In 1969, he picked up the [[Gibson SG]] and used it for most of that year and 1970, except for a small period in between where he used a [[Sunburst (finish)|sunburst]] [[Fender Stratocaster]].\n\nDuring Garcia's \"pedal steel flirtation period\" (as Bob Weir referred to it in ''[[Anthem to Beauty]]''), from approximately 1969 to 1972, he initially played a Fender instrument before upgrading to the ZB Custom D-10,<ref>{{cite book|title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History|first=Bob|last=Gulla|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=978-0-31335-806-7|p=87}}</ref> especially in his earlier public performances. Although this was a double neck guitar, Garcia often would choose not to attach the last 5 pedal rods for the rear or \"[[Western swing]]\" neck.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Additionally, he was playing an Emmons D-10<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGdLAAAAYAAJ&q=emmons+d10+garcia&dq=emmons+d10+garcia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SaWpU7zeD4LcOYeQgNAF&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ|title=Beat Instrumental & International Recording|issue=117|page=52}}</ref> at the time of the Grateful Dead's and New Riders of the Purple Sage's final appearances at the Fillmore East in late April 1971.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1969, Garcia played pedal steel on three notable outside recordings: the track \"The Farm\" on the [[Jefferson Airplane]] album ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'', the track \"Oh Mommy\" by [[Brewer and Shipley]] and the [[hit single]] \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] from their album ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', released in 1970.

In March and April 1971 \u2013 the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Grateful Dead'']] \u2013 Garcia played the \"Peanut,\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rickturnerblog.com/2017/12/05/garcias-turner-peanut-guitar/ |title=Garcia's Turner \"Peanut Guitar\" |last=Turner |first=Rick |date=December 17, 2017 |website=rickturnerblog.com |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by [[Graham Nash]].

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil [[DiMarzio]] SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a [[rose]], covers a plate just below the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ({{inflation|US|11000|1990|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"rosebud\"/>\n\nIn 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.<ref name=\"guithis\"/> After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay.<ref name=\"lightbolt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitar/Bolt.html|title=The Lightning Bolt guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar.

Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.\n\nAfter Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings.

Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p.

Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s. In Japan, the film has aired on the Japanese version of ''[[The Magical World of Disney]]'', although Disney had nothing to do with its production or release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpgHF2JPQ3I|title=Disney Channel Japan  - The Wizard of Oz: Promo|first=|last=pdptappl|date=16 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast Television Airdates ==\nEastern Time (taken from TV Guide and from The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History).\n*1956 - CBS - Saturday, November 3\u20139:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The film's first showing on television. It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\n*1968 - NBC - Saturday, April 20 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

As the Lynx, the team was affiliated with the [[Montreal Expos]] from 1993\u20132002, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] from 2003\u20132006, and the Philadelphia Phillies for the 2007 season only. The Lynx were the only International League franchise based in [[Canada]] at the time of their existence, and during the club's last years there, the team had difficulty attracting fans. The Phillies were unhappy with the local ownership of their previous affiliate, the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]], and affiliated with the Lynx when the Orioles ended their relationship. The Red Barons are now the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] and serve as the affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]]. The Phillies signed a one-year Player Development Contract (PDC) with the Lynx while [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]] was being constructed, and relocated the team to Allentown upon its completion. The IronPigs have been extremely well received in Allentown, given the Phillies' large fan base there, and the move permits Phillies' players to rehab without significant transportation time. The name \"IronPigs\" was well received by the fans in the Lehigh Valley.\n[[File:Cokepark allentown.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View from the club level at [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], home of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.]]\n\n===Before the IronPigs===\nPrior to the arrival of the IronPigs, the Lehigh Valley had not had a Minor League-affiliated baseball team since 1960, when the [[Allentown Red Sox]] left for [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern League History|publisher=Ballpark Digest|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/leagues/eastern_league.htm|accessdate=July 28, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026213400/http://www.ballparkdigest.com/leagues/eastern_league.htm|archivedate=October 26, 2006}}</ref> The Allentown Red Sox played at [[Breadon Field]] (later called Max Hess Stadium) from 1958\u20131960, at the site where the [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] stands today.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan, Sheehan|author2=Jay Hart|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-07-01/news/3628867_1_minor-league-baseball-ottawa-lynx-class-aaa-team|title=Will baseball be very, very good to the Valley with a AAA team?|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe region was previously home to two [[independent baseball]] teams: the [[Allentown Ambassadors]] of the [[Northeast League]] and the [[Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]]. The Ambassadors played at [[Bicentennial Park (Allentown)|Bicentennial Park]] in Allentown until the team was disbanded in 2004. The Black Diamonds moved from [[Newburgh, New York]] in 1999 and were expected to move into a new ballpark near [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] called the [[Lehigh Valley Multi-Purpose Sport Complex]], but the project never came to completion and ultimately was terminated. While the Black Diamonds waited for their new stadium, they played as a traveling team.\n\n===Pursuit of a Single-A franchise or Orioles affiliate===\nIn 2003, Joseph Finley and Craig Stein began actively pursuing their interest in bringing affiliated baseball back to Allentown. Initially, the duo pursued a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] franchise when the [[Ottawa Lynx]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] at the time, were rumored to be moving to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. When the city of Harrisburg did not upgrade [[Metro Bank Park]] to Triple-A standards, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] shifted their interest to Allentown because of its proximity to the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]. The Phillies also looked into moving their Triple-A operations to Allentown from the Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre region.  For the 2007 season, the Phillies shifted their Triple-A affiliate to Ottawa, leaving Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre after 18 seasons, while the Orioles affiliated with the [[Norfolk Tides]]. The Lynx relocated to Allentown as the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Phillies]] instead of being relocated as the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] Triple-A affiliate.\n\n==Season highlights==\n\n===2008 season===\nIn 2008, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs opened their first season with an 11-game losing streak. On April 14, the team broke the streak, defeating the [[Richmond Braves]] 3\u20131 at their new home stadium Coca-Cola Park. The win was both the team's first home win and their first ever as the IronPigs. Early on in the season Philadelphia Phillies center fielder [[Shane Victorino]] made a rehab start with the IronPigs. In July, Phillies starter [[Brett Myers]] pitched a few games for the team after running up a dismal 3\u20139 record in the first part of the season.\n\n===2009 season===\nIn 2009, former Phillies' pitchers [[Kyle Kendrick]] and [[J. C. Romero]] pitched for the team.  Kendrick was assigned to the IronPigs after failing to make the Phillies starting roster for 2009.  Romero pitched for the IronPigs in May 2009 following a 50-game suspension for failing Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy, after he tested positive for the use of [[androstenedione]].\n\n===2010 season===\nOn July 14, Coca-Cola Park hosted the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]], and the game was broadcast on the [[MLB Network]].\n\nOn July 7, left-handed pitcher [[J.A. Happ]] started a rehab assignment with the IronPigs. On July 29, Happ was traded to the [[Houston Astros]] for right-handed pitcher [[Roy Oswalt]].  Relief pitcher [[Michael Schwimer]] had a 1.35 ERA and held batters to a .080 batting average with runners in scoring position.<ref name=\"mcall1\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2011-08-06/sports/mc-ironpigs-sunday-0806-20110806_1_major-league-scott-mathieson-drew-carpenter|title=Michael Schwimer patiently waiting his turn|work=The Morning Call|date=August 6, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe team finished in fifth place in the International League North Division with a record of 58\u201386.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ironpigsbaseball.com/pressbox/gamecenter|title=Standings 2010 Season|website=ironpigsbaseball.com}}</ref>  The IronPigs finished the 2010 season ranked first among all affiliated Minor League Baseball teams in average attendance per home game.\n\n===2011 season===\nFormer [[MLB]] player [[Ryne Sandberg]] replaced [[Dave Huppert]] as manager prior to the season.\n\nOn April 7, 2011, the IronPigs won their season opener against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees at Coca-Cola Park, registering the first win-loss percentage above .500 in the team's history.<ref>International League Statistics</ref>{{full|date=January 2016}} Before he was promoted to the majors, All-Star closer [[Michael Schwimer]] was 9\u20131 with a 1.88 ERA, and 10 saves, with 86 strikeouts in 67.0 innings (averaging 11.6 strikeouts per 9 innings).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-18/sports/29900967_1_phillies-notes-phillies-manager-michael-schwimer|title=Phillies' Schwimer adjusting to big leagues|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=August 18, 2011|author=Gelb, Matt|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-18/sports/29900965_1_phillies-notebook-sports-hernia-roster-move|title=Schwimer called up after Polanco placed on DL|work=Philadelphia Daily News|author=David Murphy|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130131122700/http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-18/sports/29900965_1_phillies-notebook-sports-hernia-roster-move|archivedate=January 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://phillysportsdaily.com/phillies/2011/08/17/phillies-officially-call-up-michael-schwimer/|title=Phillies Officially Call Up Michael Schwimer|work=Philadelphia Sports Daily|date=August 17, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2011|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330020153/http://phillysportsdaily.com/phillies/2011/08/17/phillies-officially-call-up-michael-schwimer/|archivedate=March 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-07-14/sports/29773665_1_rehab-work-rehab-appearance-logs|title=Madson logs inning of rehab work|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2011|archivedate=September 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906044003/http://articles.philly.com/2011-07-14/sports/29773665_1_rehab-work-rehab-appearance-logs}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, the IronPigs made it to the [[Governors' Cup]] finals, losing to the [[Columbus Clippers]] three games to one.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.milb.com/lehigh-valley/news/pigs-fall-to-clippers-in-governors-cup-finals/c-24770264|title='Pigs Fall to Clippers in Governors' Cup Finals|website=MiLB.com|date=September 16, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref> The team's 2011 regular season record of 80-64 was the best record since the team was started.\n\n===2012 season===\nThe IronPigs finished the 2012 season with 75 wins and 68 losses, for a win-loss percentage of .524.

As the Lynx, the team was affiliated with the [[Montreal Expos]] from 1993\u20132002, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] from 2003\u20132006, and the Philadelphia Phillies for the 2007 season only. The Lynx were the only International League franchise based in [[Canada]] at the time of their existence, and during the club's last years there, the team had difficulty attracting fans. The Phillies were unhappy with the local ownership of their previous affiliate, the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]], and affiliated with the Lynx when the Orioles ended their relationship. The Red Barons are now the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] and serve as the affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]]. The Phillies signed a one-year Player Development Contract (PDC) with the Lynx while [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]] was being constructed, and relocated the team to Allentown upon its completion. The IronPigs have been extremely well received in Allentown, given the Phillies' large fan base there, and the move permits Phillies' players to rehab without significant transportation time. The name \"IronPigs\" was well received by the fans in the Lehigh Valley.\n[[File:Cokepark allentown.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View from the club level at [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], home of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.]]\n\n===Before the IronPigs===\nPrior to the arrival of the IronPigs, the Lehigh Valley had not had a Minor League-affiliated baseball team since 1960, when the [[Allentown Red Sox]] left for [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern League History|publisher=Ballpark Digest|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/leagues/eastern_league.htm|accessdate=July 28, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026213400/http://www.ballparkdigest.com/leagues/eastern_league.htm|archivedate=October 26, 2006}}</ref> The Allentown Red Sox played at [[Breadon Field]] (later called Max Hess Stadium) from 1958\u20131960, at the site where the [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] stands today.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan, Sheehan|author2=Jay Hart|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-07-01/news/3628867_1_minor-league-baseball-ottawa-lynx-class-aaa-team|title=Will baseball be very, very good to the Valley with a AAA team?|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe region was previously home to two [[independent baseball]] teams: the [[Allentown Ambassadors]] of the [[Northeast League]] and the [[Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]]. The Ambassadors played at [[Bicentennial Park (Allentown)|Bicentennial Park]] in Allentown until the team was disbanded in 2004. The Black Diamonds moved from [[Newburgh, New York]] in 1999 and were expected to move into a new ballpark near [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] called the [[Lehigh Valley Multi-Purpose Sport Complex]], but the project never came to completion and ultimately was terminated. While the Black Diamonds waited for their new stadium, they played as a traveling team.\n\n===Pursuit of a Single-A franchise or Orioles affiliate===\nIn 2003, Joseph Finley and Craig Stein began actively pursuing their interest in bringing affiliated baseball back to Allentown. Initially, the duo pursued a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] franchise when the [[Ottawa Lynx]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] at the time, were rumored to be moving to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. When the city of Harrisburg did not upgrade [[Metro Bank Park]] to Triple-A standards, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] shifted their interest to Allentown because of its proximity to the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]. The Phillies also looked into moving their Triple-A operations to Allentown from the Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre region.  For the 2007 season, the Phillies shifted their Triple-A affiliate to Ottawa, leaving Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre after 18 seasons, while the Orioles affiliated with the [[Norfolk Tides]]. The Lynx relocated to Allentown as the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Phillies]] instead of being relocated as the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] Triple-A affiliate.\n\n==Season highlights==\n\n===2008 season===\nIn 2008, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs opened their first season with an 11-game losing streak. On April 14, the team broke the streak, defeating the [[Richmond Braves]] 3\u20131 at their new home stadium Coca-Cola Park. The win was both the team's first home win and their first ever as the IronPigs. Early on in the season Philadelphia Phillies center fielder [[Shane Victorino]] made a rehab start with the IronPigs. In July, Phillies starter [[Brett Myers]] pitched a few games for the team after running up a dismal 3\u20139 record in the first part of the season.\n\n===2009 season===\nIn 2009, former Phillies' pitchers [[Kyle Kendrick]] and [[J. C. Romero]] pitched for the team.  Kendrick was assigned to the IronPigs after failing to make the Phillies starting roster for 2009.  Romero pitched for the IronPigs in May 2009 following a 50-game suspension for failing Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy, after he tested positive for the use of [[androstenedione]].\n\n===2010 season===\nOn July 14, Coca-Cola Park hosted the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]], and the game was broadcast on the [[MLB Network]].\n\nOn July 7, left-handed pitcher [[J.A. Happ]] started a rehab assignment with the IronPigs. On July 29, Happ was traded to the [[Houston Astros]] for right-handed pitcher [[Roy Oswalt]].

Local cable outlet [[Service Electric]] TV2 carries the IronPigs games, covering most of the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of [[Pennsylvania]]. In addition, TV2 feeds the telecasts to [[Blue Ridge Communications|Blue Ridge Cable]] TV-13 for broadcast to other areas in the eastern part of the state. In addition, select Saturday night home games are telecast on [[WFMZ-TV]] 69, which serves the Lehigh Valley as well as the northern Philadelphia market and western [[New Jersey]]. All 144 IronPigs games are also broadcast on [[WEEX]], an [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]]-based [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate.
