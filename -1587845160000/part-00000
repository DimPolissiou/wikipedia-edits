According to ''Ju-On'', when a person dies with a deep and powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in the place where that person has died or where they were frequently at, and repeats itself there. The spirits of the deceased haunt the location, potentially killing anyone who encounters the curse by any means, such as entering a cursed house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. The curse's manifestation is mainly death, where the victims' bodies may or may not disappear. The following deaths may create more curses and spread them to other locations.\n\nThe franchise consists, to date, of 13 films (9 Japanese productions, 4 American) alongside various additional media and [[merchandise]] products.<ref>[http://juon-movie.jp/juon-series/index.html Ju-on (\u546a\u6028) series]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nShimizu stated in an interview that the inspiration for ''Ju-On'' came from his own personal fears as a child, and from a Japanese dance group that would paint their nude bodies white and perform. Shimizu found the performance frightening and decided to \"paint [his] ghosts white\". He also mentioned that the rise in the number of domestic abuse cases emerging in Japan during production of his previous films gave him ideas about the origins of the story.<ref name=\"Neomag\">{{cite web|title=Ju-On: The Interview|url=http://www.neomag.co.uk/art/asian-film/article/1443/juon-the-interview|year=2013|publisher=NeoMag|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109164052/http://www.neomag.co.uk/art/asian-film/article/1443/juon-the-interview|archive-date=November 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the Japanese films translates roughly to \"Curse Grudge\", or more abstractly, a curse created due to an individual bearing a grudge against someone or something. The first two films in the series were so-called [[V-Cinema]], or [[direct-to-video]] releases, but became [[sleeper hit|surprise hit]]s as the result of favorable word of mouth. Both films were shot in nine days and feature a story that is a variation on the classic [[haunted house]] theme, as well as a popular Japanese horror trope, the \"[[vengeful ghost]]\" (''[[onry\u014d]]''). The titular [[curse]], ''ju-on'', is one which takes on a life of its own and seeks new victims. Anyone who encounters a ghost killed by the curse is killed themselves and the curse is able to be spread to other areas.\n\nUnder very tight budgetary constraints, Shimizu's films garnered much acclaim from both critics and genre fans for their effective use of limited locations and eerie atmosphere to generate chills. Shimizu was at the same time perfectly willing to show his ghosts onscreen, in contrast to some directors who might choose only to hint at their appearance. But critics noted that Shimizu's minimalist approach to directing and storytelling\u2014a necessary by-product of the production's limited overall resources\u2014allows the films to retain their ability to unnerve viewers. Very few scenes in the movies are graphically bloody, making such scenes more disturbing when they occur.<ref name=\"Neomag\"/>\n\nFollowing the success of the two direct-to-video films, and the international success of [[Hideo Nakata]]'s ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' (1998), Kurosawa and ''Ring'' screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi helped Shimizu develop a theatrical ''Ju-On'' sequel starring [[Megumi Okina]] and [[Takako Fuji]]. The first theatrical feature film, ''Ju-On: The Grudge'', was released in 2003 to critical acclaim and the [[The Grudge|US remake]] rights were purchased, with Shimizu himself attached to direct and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] starring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/the_grudge_an_i.html |title=The Grudge \u2013 An Interview with Sam Rami and Rob Tappert |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref> Later that year, another Japanese theatrical installment, ''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' was released. Due to the major success of the remake, [[The Grudge 2|an American sequel]] was released. The film was not a remake and followed a unique storyline, albeit still drawing inspiration from several Japanese films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/thegrudge2/a/grudgets080106.htm |title=Takashi Shimizu Interview on Grudge 2 and the Ju-On Movies |publisher=Movies.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923140009/http://movies.about.com/od/thegrudge2/a/grudgets080106.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 2014's ''The Beginning of The End'', in turn drew inspiration from ''The Grudge 2''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/thegrudge2/a/grudgets080106.htm |title=Takashi Shimizu Interview |access-date=September 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923140009/http://movies.about.com/od/thegrudge2/a/grudgets080106.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The most recent American sequel, 2009's ''[[The Grudge 3]]'', is set shortly after the events of the second film. The same year, the tenth anniversary of the series, two new sequels, ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Ju-On: Black Ghost'' premiered in simultaneous screenings in Japanese theaters. The films' storyline deviated from the cursed Saeki family, which all previous films had followed, instead focusing on two unrelated but also ill-fated families. \n\nIn 2014, the fifteenth anniversary of the ''Ju-On'' franchise, a new installment was released, titled ''Ju-On: The Beginning of the End''. The film is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series that features a new backstory regarding the curse while still featuring the Saeki family as an integral part of the plot. The film was followed by a 2015 sequel, ''Ju-On: The Final Curse'', which served as the supposed final film in the series. Both films had no significant input from series creator Shimizu. In 2016, a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film, ''[[Sadako vs. Kayako]]'' was released.\n\nOn March 20, 2014, it was announced that an American reboot was in the works, written by Jeff Buhler and produced by Sam Raimi, as with all previous American installments. The film was released in January 2020 and is the only release in the franchise, along with ''The Grudge 3'', to have a primarily American setting.<ref name=\"deadline.com\">{{cite news|title=Horror Hit \u2018The Grudge\u2019 Going Reboot Route|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/03/horror-hit-the-grudge-going-reboot-route/|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=deadline.com|date=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Ju-On'' timeline===\n''Ju-On'' originally started off with two short films which were included as vignettes in ''Gakk\u014d no kaidan G''. The story of these shorts was later further explored in two low-budget, V-Cinema, Japanese television movies in 2000, both shot in the course of nine days. Three years later, due to the success of the videos, director Takashi Shimizu made a theatrical sequel to the V-Cinema videos, titled ''Ju-On: The Grudge''. Another sequel was released in 2003, titled ''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' (or simply ''Ju-On 2''). A year later Takashi Shimizu directed ''The Grudge'', the American remake. It is primarily based on the first theatrical version of ''Ju-On'', but it contains scenes re-enacted from all of the ''Ju-On'' movies. Following ''The Grudge 2'' and ''3'' (released in Japan as ''Juon: Pandemic'', and ''Juon - The Grudge 3''), in 2009, two films titled ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Black Ghost'' were released in honour of the series' tenth anniversary. 2014's ''Ju-On: The Beginning of the End'' and 2015's ''Ju-On: The Final Curse'' are set in an [[Reboot (fiction)|alternate continuity]] that altered much of the series' original backstory.\n\n====1998====\n* [[Katasumi and 4444444444|''Katasumi'' and ''4444444444'']]'' (shown within [[television movie]] ''Gakk\u014d no kaidan G'')\n:''Katasumi'' follows the demise of Kanna and her classmate, Hisayo. They are feeding rabbits at school when Kayako, the ghost in the series and the curse's fulfiller, attacks them both.\n:''4444444444'' follows the death of Tsuyoshi, Kanna's older brother. Tsuyoshi comes to school to meet his girlfriend, Mizuho, and finds a mysterious ringing cell phone whose caller ID shows a strange number, 4444444444 (The number 4 in Japanese is a [[homophone]] of the Japanese character for \"death\"). The ghost of Toshio, Kayako's son and also one of the curse's fulfillers, appears and takes Tsuyoshi; his body is never found.\n\nThe stories of Kanna and Tsuyoshi are further extended in ''Ju-On: The Curse''.\n\n====2000====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Curse]]'' (V-Cinema)\n:The first ''Ju-On'' follows the lives of the people connected to a house in Nerima, Tokyo where a gruesome murder of a housewife occurred. School teacher Shunsuke Kobayashi visits the home of his absent student, Toshio, where he discovers the boy beaten and bruised. He waits for Toshio's parents to come but soon realizes what the Saeki family has become and is killed, his wife and unborn child being murdered as well by Kayako's crazed husband Takeo after he learned Kayako was obsessively in love with Kobayashi. Takeo is in turn killed by Kayako's ghost. The movie also explores the fates of the next family to live in the house, the Murakami family, as well as two people who come in contact with them, including Mizuho Tamura, who is killed while waiting for her boyfriend Tsuyoshi at the school. The film extends the stories of Tsuyoshi and Kanna from ''Katasumi and 4444444444''. The last segment shows a snippet of Kyoko Suzuki's arrival, a psychic who was invited by her brother to explore the house that he was going to sell, which was the cursed Saeki house. This movie showed death or vanishing as the curse's result.[[File:Ju-on The Curse.png|thumb|right|Chiaki Kuriyama as Mizuho Tamura in ''Ju-On: The Curse'']]\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Curse 2]]'' (V-Cinema); (Available only in Japan, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, France and Belgium)\n:''Ju-on: The Curse 2'' continues the story of Kyoko Suzuki and shows how the curse fatally affected her and everyone in her family. A large portion of this film is a recap of the previous installment. It also portrays the story of a couple, the Kitadas, living in the house as the wife becomes possessed by Kayako's spirit and murders her husband. The film features the extended storyline of Detective Kamio from ''Ju-on: The Curse''. ''The Curse 2'' also introduces a group of school girls who had sneaked into the house, one of them being Izumi Toyama, whose story would be continued in ''Ju-On: The Grudge''.\n\n====2002====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge]]''\n:''Ju-On: The Grudge'' centers around the fate of social worker Rika Nishina. Rika comes to visit the house of Tokunagas (the old Saeki house) where she was summoned after the social worker assigned to the house has disappeared. Surviving a terrible experience in that house, she discovers the truth behind the deaths connected to the house. It was later revealed that Rika was the one destined to play out the curse: she was to die the same way Kayako did and become the next fulfiller of the Ju-on. In this movie, it was revealed that the curse has some time-traveling capabilities (or [[residual haunting]]) where a victim may see another victim from another time frame. An example is Det. Yuji Toyama seeing what will happen to his daughter, Izumi, years after his death when she enters the house. Izumi was only 12 years old when Yuji died and when she entered the house at 16, she sees her father just before he encounters Kayako.  However, this is not just prior to his death, because he runs out of the house and it is later revealed by Izumi's mother that he went insane before he died.\nIt is worth noting that this film and its sequel are not remakes of the V-Cinema films, as is commonly believed but are, in fact, sequels.\n\n====2003====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge 2]]''\n:''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' revolves around the actress Kyoko Harase and her pregnancy. After a car accident caused by Toshio's ghost, Kyoko apparently miscarries. When her doctor assures her of a healthy pregnancy, Kyoko becomes perplexed. It is revealed that Kyoko was involved with a horror television production filmed at a haunted house - the house of the Saekis in Nerima. Producer Keisuke finds Kyoko and informs her that most members of the film crew have either been killed or gone missing. The outcome of Kyoko's pregnancy is horrifyingly revealed as she gives birth to Kayako. Several years later, a child version of Kayako pushes her new mother, Kyoko, off an overpass and kills her. She is then seen walking away into the streets.\n\n====2004====\n* ''[[The Grudge]]''\n: This was largely a remake of ''Ju-On: The Grudge'', following the story of Karen Davis ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), a social worker assigned to take care of Emma Williams. The movie varies slightly from the original, because Karen burns the house and survives the curse. However, the house is saved.\n\n====2006====\n* ''Tales from the Grudge''\nThree short films (''Hotel'', ''School'', ''House'') titled ''Tales from the Grudge'' were released as part of marketing [[The Grudge 2]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203734/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/3578583/news?item_id=3906279</ref>\n\n* ''[[The Grudge 2]]''\n: The film tells the story of a school-girl called Allison who was pressured to enter the house by her friends Vanessa and Miyuki. The curse follows her to Chicago even though she tries to escape it, causing her Chicago apartment to be cursed. The film also follows the story of Aubrey, Karen's younger sister, on her quest to stop the curse after Karen falls to her death from a hospital roof.\n\n====2009====\n*''[[The Grudge 3]]'' was released on [[DVD]] on May 12, 2009. This film is a continuation of the events that took place in the Chicago, Illinois vignette of The Grudge 2.\n*''[[Ju-On: Black Ghost]]''\n*''[[Ju-On: White Ghost]]''\n:In honor of the 10th anniversary of the ''Ju-On'' series ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Ju-On: Black Ghost'' premiered in simultaneous screenings in theaters in Japan on June 27, 2009.<ref>[https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17712 White Ghost, Black Ghost in 'Ju-On' Sequels]</ref> [[Takashi Shimizu]] and Taka Ichise returned to supervise the films' production, each with a different director. \n:''Black Ghost'' revolves around a girl named Fukie who has been having bizarre attacks accompanied by a death rattle. Test results show a cyst inside Fukie\u2019s body, but that cyst is actually the physical remnant of a twin that Fukie's body partially absorbed in the womb. The cyst holds a grudge for not being born and influences several characters to commit murder sprees via [[spiritual possession]]. Fukie's mother, Kiwako takes the spirit (inside Fukie's body) and jumps off the hospital rooftop with it, killing them both. However, this leads to the spirit being released from the body.\n:''White Ghost'' revolves around a son that brutally murdered all five of his family members and ultimately hanged himself. One of the victims was his niece Mirai, who he had sexually abused. Mirai's former friend Akane saw evidence that she was being sexually abused by her uncle, but did not help her. Several years later Mirai's spirit came to haunt her.\nThough there is no evidence, these two movies are believed to be in continuity with the original films.\n\n====2014====\n*''[[Ju-On: The Beginning of the End]]''\n:Produced and co-written by Takashige Ichise with [[Masayuki Ochiai (film director)|Masayuki Ochiai]] directing and co-writing,<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/ju-on-owari-no-hajimari-the-grudge/233519/director-ochiai-masayuki-will-carry-the-grudge-in-new-ju-on-pic Seventh Ju-on]</ref> this is the first film in the franchise that has no involvement from series creator Takashi Shimizu. Unlike ''White Ghost'' and ''Black Ghost'', the film features the Saeki family, including Takeo, Kayako, and Toshio, albeit with an altered backstory.\n:''The Beginning of the End'' includes two storylines, one set in 2004 that focuses on four schoolgirls who disappeared one by one since their visit to the cursed house, and one set ten years afterward in 2014, which follows Yui Shono, a new elementary schoolteacher whose life is tainted with the curse after a visit to the house of an absent student, Toshio Saeki.\n\n====2015====\n*''[[Ju-On: The Final Curse]]''\n:The eleventh and final installment was released in 2015, again produced and co-written by Takashige Ichise and directed and co-written by Masayuki Ochiai.

The novels were all published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] and only the first novel received an English translation.\n\n===Comics===\nTwo manga adaptations were released in 2003 in Japan and 2006 in the US, titled ''Ju-On: Video Side'' and ''Ju-On: Vol. 2''. The manga follows events from the series that were omitted in the novels.\n\n==Video game==\n{{main|Ju-On: The Grudge (video game)}}\nIn honor of the series' 10th anniversary, a game, titled ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge (video game)|Ju-On: The Grudge \u2013 Haunted House Simulator]]'' was developed for the Wii. The game was released in Japan in 2009 by [[AQ Interactive]] under the title ''Kyoufu Taikan: Ju-On'' (''Fear Experience: Ju-On''), and in Europe under the title ''Ju-On: A Fright Simulator''. Upon release, the game was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|critically panned]].\n\nThe video game was confirmed on May 22, 2009. Shortly afterwards, a demo of the game was unveiled at [[E3 2009]], where Xseed Games described it as a \"haunted house [[Simulation video game|simulator]],\" rather than a traditional survival horror game. The game does not feature any combat, as its format relies on subtle exploration and scare tactics. [[Joystiq]] reviewers who were present for the demo's screening at the E3 justified this, observing that, \"In most horror games, a skilled player can actually defeat the creatures (with notable exceptions like ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'''s [[Pyramid Head]] ...), making the game more of a power fantasy than a true fright. In both of these games [''Silent Hill 2'' and ''Ju-On: The Grudge''], you can escape the creatures at best.\"<ref name=\"Joystiq\">{{cite web | first=JC | last=Fletcher | title=Impressions: Ju-on: The Grudge (Wii) | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/06/07/impressions-ju-on-the-grudge-wii/ | work= | publisher=[[Joystiq]] | date=June 7, 2009 | accessdate=June 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Grudge (film series)|''The Grudge'' (film series)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|1=http://juon-movie.jp/}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0330500|title=Ju-on}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0330501|title=Ju-on 2}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0364385|title=Ju-on: The Grudge}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0367913|title=Ju-on: The Grudge 2}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=1422675|title=Ju-on: White Ghost}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=1422674|title=Ju-on: Black Ghost}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=3572132|title=Ju-on: The Beginning of the End}}\n\n{{Ju-on & The Grudge|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ju-On}}\n[[Category:Horror media franchises]]\n[[Category:Japanese supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Ju-On (franchise)| ]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2011}}\n{{Infobox media franchise\n|title       = Ju-On\n|image       = Ju-on_logo.png\n|image_size  = 220\n|caption     = Franchise logo\n|creator     = [[Takashi Shimizu]]\n|origin      = [[Katasumi and 4444444444|''Katasumi'' and ''4444444444'']] (1998)\n|books       =\n|novels      = {{Plainlist|\n*''Ju-On'' (2003)\n*''Ju-On 2'' (2003)\n*''Ju-On'' (2005)\n*''Ju-On: White Ghost'' (2009)\n*''Ju-On: Black Ghost'' (2009)\n*''Ju-On: The Beginning of the End'' (2014)\n*''Ju-On: The Final Curse'' (2015)\n}}\n|comics      = {{Plainlist|\n*''Ju-On: Video Side''\n*''Ju-On: Vol. 2''\n*''The Grudge''\n}}\n|graphic_novels = ''The Grudge 1.5''\n|magazines   =\n|strips      =\n|films       = {{Plainlist|\n*''[[Ju-On: The Curse]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Ju-On: The Curse 2]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Ju-on: The Grudge|Ju-On: The Grudge]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Ju-on: The Grudge 2|Ju-On: The Grudge 2]]'' (2003)\n*''[[The Grudge]]'' (2004)\n*''[[The Grudge 2]]'' (2006)\n*''[[The Grudge 3]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Ju-On: White Ghost]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Ju-On: Black Ghost]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Ju-On: The Beginning of the End]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Ju-On: The Final Curse]]'' (2015)\n*''[[Sadako vs. Kayako]]'' (2016)\n*''[[The Grudge (2020 film)|The Grudge]]'' (2020)\n}}\n|shorts     = {{Plainlist|\n*''[[Katasumi and 4444444444]]'' (1998)\n*''[[The Grudge 2#Marketing|Tales from the Grudge]]'' (2006)\n}}\n|tv          = \n|games       =\n|rpgs        =\n|vgs         = ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge (video game)|Ju-On: The Grudge]]'' (2009)\n|radio       =\n|soundtracks = {{Plainlist|\n*''Ju-On: The Grudge''\n*''Ju-On: The Grudge 2''\n*''The Grudge''\n*''The Grudge 2''\n}}\n|music       = \n|otherlabel1 = Pachinko\n|otherdata1  = ''CR Ju-On''\n|footnotes   = \n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Ju-On'''''|\u546a\u6028|Juon|lit. \"Curse Grudge\", also known as '''''The Grudge'''''}} is a Japanese-American horror [[media franchise|franchise]] created by [[Takashi Shimizu]]. The franchise began in 1998 with the release of the short films [[Katasumi and 4444444444|''Katsumi'' and ''4444444444'']]. Shimizu attended the Film School of Tokyo, where he studied under [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]]. Kurosawa helped Shimizu shepherd the ''Ju-On'' projects to fruition.<ref>[http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/shimizu-takashi-on-the-grudge Takashi Shimizu's Ju-on]</ref>\n\nThe ''Ju-On'' films generally revolve around a curse created in a house in [[Nerima, Tokyo]] (or [[Suginami]] in the American films) when [[Takeo Saeki]], convinced that his wife [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]] was having an affair with another man, murdered her, their son [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]] and Toshio's pet cat in a jealous rage. According to ''Ju-On'', when a person dies with a deep and powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in the place where that person has died or where they were frequently at, and repeats itself there. The spirits of the deceased haunt the location, potentially killing anyone who encounters the curse by any means, such as entering a cursed house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. The curse's manifestation is mainly death, where the victims' bodies may or may not disappear. The following deaths may create more curses and spread them to other locations.\n\nThe franchise consists, to date, of 13 films (9 Japanese productions, 4 American) alongside various additional media and [[merchandise]] products.<ref>[http://juon-movie.jp/juon-series/index.html Ju-on (\u546a\u6028) series]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nShimizu stated in an interview that the inspiration for ''Ju-On'' came from his own personal fears as a child, and from a Japanese dance group that would paint their nude bodies white and perform. Shimizu found the performance frightening and decided to \"paint [his] ghosts white\". He also mentioned that the rise in the number of domestic abuse cases emerging in Japan during production of his previous films gave him ideas about the origins of the story.<ref name=\"Neomag\">{{cite web|title=Ju-On: The Interview|url=http://www.neomag.co.uk/art/asian-film/article/1443/juon-the-interview|year=2013|publisher=NeoMag|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109164052/http://www.neomag.co.uk/art/asian-film/article/1443/juon-the-interview|archive-date=November 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the Japanese films translates roughly to \"Curse Grudge\", or more abstractly, a curse created due to an individual bearing a grudge against someone or something. The first two films in the series were so-called [[V-Cinema]], or [[direct-to-video]] releases, but became [[sleeper hit|surprise hit]]s as the result of favorable word of mouth. Both films were shot in nine days and feature a story that is a variation on the classic [[haunted house]] theme, as well as a popular Japanese horror trope, the \"[[vengeful ghost]]\" (''[[onry\u014d]]''). The titular [[curse]], ''ju-on'', is one which takes on a life of its own and seeks new victims. Anyone who encounters a ghost killed by the curse is killed themselves and the curse is able to be spread to other areas.\n\nUnder very tight budgetary constraints, Shimizu's films garnered much acclaim from both critics and genre fans for their effective use of limited locations and eerie atmosphere to generate chills. Shimizu was at the same time perfectly willing to show his ghosts onscreen, in contrast to some directors who might choose only to hint at their appearance. But critics noted that Shimizu's minimalist approach to directing and storytelling\u2014a necessary by-product of the production's limited overall resources\u2014allows the films to retain their ability to unnerve viewers. Very few scenes in the movies are graphically bloody, making such scenes more disturbing when they occur.<ref name=\"Neomag\"/>\n\nFollowing the success of the two direct-to-video films, and the international success of [[Hideo Nakata]]'s ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' (1998), Kurosawa and ''Ring'' screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi helped Shimizu develop a theatrical ''Ju-On'' sequel starring [[Megumi Okina]] and [[Takako Fuji]]. The first theatrical feature film, ''Ju-On: The Grudge'', was released in 2003 to critical acclaim and the [[The Grudge|US remake]] rights were purchased, with Shimizu himself attached to direct and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] starring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/the_grudge_an_i.html |title=The Grudge \u2013 An Interview with Sam Rami and Rob Tappert |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref> Later that year, another Japanese theatrical installment, ''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' was released. Due to the major success of the remake, [[The Grudge 2|an American sequel]] was released.

The same year, the tenth anniversary of the series, two new sequels, ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Ju-On: Black Ghost'' premiered in simultaneous screenings in Japanese theaters. The films' storyline deviated from the cursed Saeki family, which all previous films had followed, instead focusing on two unrelated but also ill-fated families. \n\nIn 2014, the fifteenth anniversary of the ''Ju-On'' franchise, a new installment was released, titled ''Ju-On: The Beginning of the End''. The film is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series that features a new backstory regarding the curse while still featuring the Saeki family as an integral part of the plot. The film was followed by a 2015 sequel, ''Ju-On: The Final Curse'', which served as the supposed final film in the series. Both films had no significant input from series creator Shimizu. In 2016, a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film, ''[[Sadako vs. Kayako]]'' was released.\n\nOn March 20, 2014, it was announced that an American reboot was in the works, written by Jeff Buhler and produced by Sam Raimi, as with all previous American installments. The film was released in January 2020 and is the only release in the franchise, along with ''The Grudge 3'', to have a primarily American setting.<ref name=\"deadline.com\">{{cite news|title=Horror Hit \u2018The Grudge\u2019 Going Reboot Route|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/03/horror-hit-the-grudge-going-reboot-route/|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=deadline.com|date=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Ju-On'' timeline===\n''Ju-On'' originally started off with two short films which were included as vignettes in ''Gakk\u014d no kaidan G''. The story of these shorts was later further explored in two low-budget, V-Cinema, Japanese television movies in 2000, both shot in the course of nine days. Three years later, due to the success of the videos, director Takashi Shimizu made a theatrical sequel to the V-Cinema videos, titled ''Ju-On: The Grudge''. Another sequel was released in 2003, titled ''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' (or simply ''Ju-On 2''). A year later Takashi Shimizu directed ''The Grudge'', the American remake. It is primarily based on the first theatrical version of ''Ju-On'', but it contains scenes re-enacted from all of the ''Ju-On'' movies. Following ''The Grudge 2'' and ''3'' (released in Japan as ''Juon: Pandemic'', and ''Juon - The Grudge 3''), in 2009, two films titled ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Black Ghost'' were released in honour of the series' tenth anniversary. 2014's ''Ju-On: The Beginning of the End'' and 2015's ''Ju-On: The Final Curse'' are set in an [[Reboot (fiction)|alternate continuity]] that altered much of the series' original backstory.\n\n====1998====\n* [[Katasumi and 4444444444|''Katasumi'' and ''4444444444'']]'' (shown within [[television movie]] ''Gakk\u014d no kaidan G'')\n:''Katasumi'' follows the demise of Kanna and her classmate, Hisayo.

Tsuyoshi comes to school to meet his girlfriend, Mizuho, and finds a mysterious ringing cell phone whose caller ID shows a strange number, 4444444444 (The number 4 in Japanese is a [[homophone]] of the Japanese character for \"death\"). The ghost of Toshio, Kayako's son and also one of the curse's fulfillers, appears and takes Tsuyoshi; his body is never found.\n\nThe stories of Kanna and Tsuyoshi are further extended in ''Ju-On: The Curse''.\n\n====2000====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Curse]]'' (V-Cinema)\n:The first ''Ju-On'' follows the lives of the people connected to a house in Nerima, Tokyo where a gruesome murder of a housewife occurred. School teacher Shunsuke Kobayashi visits the home of his absent student, Toshio, where he discovers the boy beaten and bruised. He waits for Toshio's parents to come but soon realizes what the Saeki family has become and is killed, his wife and unborn child being murdered as well by Kayako's crazed husband Takeo after he learned Kayako was obsessively in love with Kobayashi. Takeo is in turn killed by Kayako's ghost. The movie also explores the fates of the next family to live in the house, the Murakami family, as well as two people who come in contact with them, including Mizuho Tamura, who is killed while waiting for her boyfriend Tsuyoshi at the school. The film extends the stories of Tsuyoshi and Kanna from ''Katasumi and 4444444444''. The last segment shows a snippet of Kyoko Suzuki's arrival, a psychic who was invited by her brother to explore the house that he was going to sell, which was the cursed Saeki house. This movie showed death or vanishing as the curse's result.[[File:Ju-on The Curse.png|thumb|right|Chiaki Kuriyama as Mizuho Tamura in ''Ju-On: The Curse'']]\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Curse 2]]'' (V-Cinema); (Available only in Japan, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, France and Belgium)\n:''Ju-on: The Curse 2'' continues the story of Kyoko Suzuki and shows how the curse fatally affected her and everyone in her family. A large portion of this film is a recap of the previous installment. It also portrays the story of a couple, the Kitadas, living in the house as the wife becomes possessed by Kayako's spirit and murders her husband. The film features the extended storyline of Detective Kamio from ''Ju-on: The Curse''. ''The Curse 2'' also introduces a group of school girls who had sneaked into the house, one of them being Izumi Toyama, whose story would be continued in ''Ju-On: The Grudge''.\n\n====2002====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge]]''\n:''Ju-On: The Grudge'' centers around the fate of social worker Rika Nishina. Rika comes to visit the house of Tokunagas (the old Saeki house) where she was summoned after the social worker assigned to the house has disappeared. Surviving a terrible experience in that house, she discovers the truth behind the deaths connected to the house. It was later revealed that Rika was the one destined to play out the curse: she was to die the same way Kayako did and become the next fulfiller of the Ju-on. In this movie, it was revealed that the curse has some time-traveling capabilities (or [[residual haunting]]) where a victim may see another victim from another time frame. An example is Det. Yuji Toyama seeing what will happen to his daughter, Izumi, years after his death when she enters the house. Izumi was only 12 years old when Yuji died and when she entered the house at 16, she sees her father just before he encounters Kayako.  However, this is not just prior to his death, because he runs out of the house and it is later revealed by Izumi's mother that he went insane before he died.\nIt is worth noting that this film and its sequel are not remakes of the V-Cinema films, as is commonly believed but are, in fact, sequels.\n\n====2003====\n* ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge 2]]''\n:''Ju-On: The Grudge 2'' revolves around the actress Kyoko Harase and her pregnancy. After a car accident caused by Toshio's ghost, Kyoko apparently miscarries. When her doctor assures her of a healthy pregnancy, Kyoko becomes perplexed. It is revealed that Kyoko was involved with a horror television production filmed at a haunted house - the house of the Saekis in Nerima. Producer Keisuke finds Kyoko and informs her that most members of the film crew have either been killed or gone missing. The outcome of Kyoko's pregnancy is horrifyingly revealed as she gives birth to Kayako. Several years later, a child version of Kayako pushes her new mother, Kyoko, off an overpass and kills her. She is then seen walking away into the streets.\n\n====2004====\n* ''[[The Grudge]]''\n: This was largely a remake of ''Ju-On: The Grudge'', following the story of Karen Davis ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), a social worker assigned to take care of Emma Williams. The movie varies slightly from the original, because Karen burns the house and survives the curse. However, the house is saved.\n\n====2006====\n* ''Tales from the Grudge''\nThree short films (''Hotel'', ''School'', ''House'') titled ''Tales from the Grudge'' were released as part of marketing [[The Grudge 2]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203734/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/3578583/news?item_id=3906279</ref>\n\n* ''[[The Grudge 2]]''\n: The film tells the story of a school-girl called Allison who was pressured to enter the house by her friends Vanessa and Miyuki. The curse follows her to Chicago even though she tries to escape it, causing her Chicago apartment to be cursed. The film also follows the story of Aubrey, Karen's younger sister, on her quest to stop the curse after Karen falls to her death from a hospital roof.\n\n====2009====\n*''[[The Grudge 3]]'' was released on [[DVD]] on May 12, 2009. This film is a continuation of the events that took place in the Chicago, Illinois vignette of The Grudge 2.\n*''[[Ju-On: Black Ghost]]''\n*''[[Ju-On: White Ghost]]''\n:In honor of the 10th anniversary of the ''Ju-On'' series ''Ju-On: White Ghost'' and ''Ju-On: Black Ghost'' premiered in simultaneous screenings in theaters in Japan on June 27, 2009.<ref>[https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17712 White Ghost, Black Ghost in 'Ju-On' Sequels]</ref> [[Takashi Shimizu]] and Taka Ichise returned to supervise the films' production, each with a different director. \n:''Black Ghost'' revolves around a girl named Fukie who has been having bizarre attacks accompanied by a death rattle. Test results show a cyst inside Fukie\u2019s body, but that cyst is actually the physical remnant of a twin that Fukie's body partially absorbed in the womb. The cyst holds a grudge for not being born and influences several characters to commit murder sprees via [[spiritual possession]]. Fukie's mother, Kiwako takes the spirit (inside Fukie's body) and jumps off the hospital rooftop with it, killing them both. However, this leads to the spirit being released from the body.\n:''White Ghost'' revolves around a son that brutally murdered all five of his family members and ultimately hanged himself. One of the victims was his niece Mirai, who he had sexually abused. Mirai's former friend Akane saw evidence that she was being sexually abused by her uncle, but did not help her. Several years later Mirai's spirit came to haunt her.\nThough there is no evidence, these two movies are believed to be in continuity with the original films.\n\n====2014====\n*''[[Ju-On: The Beginning of the End]]''\n:Produced and co-written by Takashige Ichise with [[Masayuki Ochiai (film director)|Masayuki Ochiai]] directing and co-writing,<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/ju-on-owari-no-hajimari-the-grudge/233519/director-ochiai-masayuki-will-carry-the-grudge-in-new-ju-on-pic Seventh Ju-on]</ref> this is the first film in the franchise that has no involvement from series creator Takashi Shimizu. Unlike ''White Ghost'' and ''Black Ghost'', the film features the Saeki family, including Takeo, Kayako, and Toshio, albeit with an altered backstory.\n:''The Beginning of the End'' includes two storylines, one set in 2004 that focuses on four schoolgirls who disappeared one by one since their visit to the cursed house, and one set ten years afterward in 2014, which follows Yui Shono, a new elementary schoolteacher whose life is tainted with the curse after a visit to the house of an absent student, Toshio Saeki.\n\n====2015====\n*''[[Ju-On: The Final Curse]]''\n:The eleventh and final installment was released in 2015, again produced and co-written by Takashige Ichise and directed and co-written by Masayuki Ochiai. It follows the new continuity established by ''The Beginning of the End''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/juonmovie/status/567599725952520192 \u546a\u6028 -\u30b6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb-]</ref>\n:''The Final Curse'' follows Mai, the older sister of ''The Beginning of the End'' lead character, Yui Shono, as she becomes involved with the curse while searching for the whereabouts of her missing sister.\n\n====2016====\n*''[[Sadako vs. Kayako]]''\n:The latest installment sees a crossover between ''Ju-On'' and fellow Japanese horror series ''[[The Ring (franchise)|Ring]]'', pitting [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]] against [[Sadako Yamamura]]. At the end of the movie, both ghosts combine atop Sadako's well, into which a girl named Yuri Kurahashi, having decided to use herself as a bait, had jumped. After they fuse together, they become one powerful ghost named Sadakaya.\n\n====2020====\n*''[[The Grudge (2020 film)| The Grudge]]''\nIn March 2014, it was officially announced that [[Ghost House Pictures]] and [[Good Universe]] would be rebooting the franchise and that Jeff Buhler would be writing the film.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2014/03/horror-hit-the-grudge-going-reboot-route-702157/ Horror Hit \u2018The Grudge\u2019 Going Reboot Route]</ref> Buhler stated that the reboot would feature all new characters and ghosts and not tie-in to the mythology of the original series.<ref>[https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/115004/exclusive-screenwriter-jeff-buhler-talks-the-grudge-reboot// Exclusive: Screenwriter Jeff Buhler Talks The Grudge Reboot]</ref> In July 2017, it was announced that Nicolas Pesce was set to direct the film, and would also be rewriting the script based on Buhler's draft.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2017/07/the-grudge-reboot-nicolas-pesce-directing-ghost-house-pictures-120212478/ \u2018The Grudge\u2019 Reboot Gets Nicolas Pesce To Direct For Ghost House]</ref> On March 2, 2018 it was reported that [[Andrea Riseborough]] was in talks to star in the film, and on March 15, 2018 it was confirmed that Riseborough and [[Demian Bichir]] had officially joined the cast.

The game was released in Japan in 2009 by [[AQ Interactive]] under the title ''Kyoufu Taikan: Ju-On'' (''Fear Experience: Ju-On''), and in Europe under the title ''Ju-On: A Fright Simulator''. Upon release, the game was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|critically panned]].\n\nThe video game was confirmed on May 22, 2009. Shortly afterwards, a demo of the game was unveiled at [[E3 2009]], where Xseed Games described it as a \"haunted house [[Simulation video game|simulator]],\" rather than a traditional survival horror game. The game does not feature any combat, as its format relies on subtle exploration and scare tactics. [[Joystiq]] reviewers who were present for the demo's screening at the E3 justified this, observing that, \"In most horror games, a skilled player can actually defeat the creatures (with notable exceptions like ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'''s [[Pyramid Head]] ...), making the game more of a power fantasy than a true fright.

A foam sleeping pad can be seen underneath the sleeping bag.]]\n\nA '''sleeping bag''' is an insulated covering for a person, essentially a lightweight quilt that can be closed with a [[zipper]] or similar means to form a tube, which functions as lightweight, portable [[bedding]] in situations where a person is sleeping outdoors (e.g. when [[camping]], [[hiking]], [[hill walking]] or [[climbing]]). Its primary purpose is to provide warmth and [[thermal insulation]] through its synthetic or down insulation. It also typically has a water-resistant or water-repellent cover that protects, to some extent, against [[wind chill]] and light [[precipitation]], but a [[tent]] is usually used in addition to a sleeping bag, as it performs those functions better. The bottom surface also provides some cushioning, but a [[sleeping pad]] or [[camp cot]] is usually used in addition for that purpose. The bottom surface of a sleeping bag may be moderately water repellent, but a plastic [[Tarpaulin|tarp]] or groundsheet is often used to protect against moist ground.\n\nThere are a range of sleeping bag models designed for different purposes. Very lightly insulated sleeping bags are designed for summer camping use or for indoor use by children during slumber parties. Well-insulated bags are designed for cold weather use. The most well-insulated and lightweight sleeping bags, which are designed for serious hikers and adventurers, are more expensive than lightly insulated sleeping bags. One subcategory of cold-weather sleeping bag, the mummy bag, is so named because it has an insulated hood for the head. A [[bivouac shelter|bivouac sack]] (''bivy'') is a [[waterproof]] cover for a sleeping bag that may be used in place of a tent by minimalist, experienced hikers. A bivy bag may also be carried by day hikers as a backup or emergency shelter, to be used if they cannot make it back to their starting point by nightfall due to inclement weather or getting lost.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Three person buffalo sleeping bag.jpg|thumb|left|A three-person buffalo sleeping bag used during Arctic exploration circa 1880]]\nThe \"Euklisia Rug\", from Ancient Greek \u03b5\u1f56 (well) and \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (cot, sleeping-place), patented by mail-order pioneer [[Pryce Pryce-Jones]] in 1876,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-day-in-the-life.powys.org.uk/eng/home/eo_euklisia.php|title=Euklisia Rug|publisher=A-day-in-the-life.powys.org.uk|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> may have been the first forerunner of the modern sleeping bag. Pryce-Jones, a [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown, Montgomeryshire]] Welsh entrepreneur developed the bag and exported around the world in the late 19th century. Documents show he sold 60,000 of these rugs to the Russian army - and the British army also bought them. There are records of civilian uses too - among missionaries in Africa and pioneers in the Australian outback.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/gh5qCU47Ryyc2fOqSjKiLw |title=A History of the World - Object : Euklisia Rug |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Design types==\n[[File:Sleeping bag for space.JPG|thumb|Russian sleeping bag used in space station [[Mir]] and [[International Space Station]]]]\nA basic sleeping bag is simply a square [[blanket]] or [[quilt]], fitted with a [[zipper]] on two or three sides, which enables users to get into the bag and then close it up.  A sleeping bag of this type is packed by being folded in half or thirds, rolled up, and bound with [[strap]]s or cords with [[cord lock]]s. The basic design works well for most camping needs but is inadequate under more demanding circumstances.\n\nThe second major type of sleeping bag, sometimes called a '''mummy bag''' because of its shape, is different in a number of important ways. It tapers from the head end to the foot end, reducing its [[volume]] and [[surface area]], and improving its overall heat retention properties. Some bags are designed especially to accommodate women's body shapes. Most mummy bags do not unzip all the way to the feet, because the zipper is a weak point in any sleeping bag's insulating qualities. Together with the tapered shape, this design feature helps protect the [[foot|feet]], which are more vulnerable to heat loss than other parts of the body. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Another design feature is a [[drawstring]], equipped with a [[cord lock]], at the head end to help prevent the escape of warm air. A mummy bag often cannot be rolled like a rectangular bag. Instead, it is simply stuffed into a [[stuff sack]] or compression sack.\n\nThe bottom of a sleeping bag typically does not provide significant insulation, because body weight crushes the loft of the insulation material. It is therefore necessary to use a pad or other less crush-able insulation underneath the sleeper, especially in cold weather. Due to this, some sleeping bags do not include insulation on the bottom. Some include a sleeve for holding a sleeping pad. Additionally, some campers, especially ultralight backpackers or hammock campers, have started to use a top quilt, essentially a sleeping bag without a back. Some top quilts include a foot box, while others are just simple blankets.\n\n==Fill==\n[[File:compactsleepingbag.jpg|thumb|300px|A highly compact sleeping bag measuring 23 cm/9 in with a diameter of 12 cm/5 in when packed but {{convert|210|x|65|cm|ft|abbr=on}} when unfolded.]]\nMany insulating materials are available for sleeping bags. Inexpensive sleeping bags for warm weather use or use by children indoors typically have a layer of synthetic quilt insulation. Outdoor professionals and serious amateur adventurers usually prefer either synthetic fill (e.g. [[PrimaLoft]]), or natural fill (e.g. [[down feathers|down]]), and they have debated the merits of these materials for years.\n\nSynthetic fill does not readily absorb [[water]], dries easily, and provides some warmth even when thoroughly soaked. These properties may save the owner's life if, for example, the sleeping bag is accidentally dropped into water on a cold day. Synthetic material is also firm and resilient, so it insulates well even underneath a person's weight. On the flipside, synthetic fill cannot be compressed as much as down and it weighs more, causing such bags to take up more space and weight when not in use. Furthermore, synthetic insulation tends to break down faster than its natural counterpart.\n\nDown fill weighs less than synthetic and retains heat better, but usually costs more. Down must be kept dry; a soaked down sleeping bag may provide even less insulation than no sleeping bag at all, leading to [[hypothermia]]. Newer, more technically advanced sleeping bags often have water-resistant shells and can be used in damper conditions. It is also recommended to keep a sleeping bag in a larger sack (storage sack) as opposed to the small traveling sack (compression bag) during long periods of storage. However, many regular backpackers and hikers agree that hanging a sleeping bag, taking care to move the position of the bag on the hanger at intervals so as to not create a \"dead spot\" (a spot where the fill has been crushed so that it is no longer useful), is the best method of storing a bag for long durations.\n\nOther materials, notably [[cotton]] and [[wool]], have also been used for sleeping bags. Wool repels water nicely and also resists compression, but it weighs much more than any alternative. Cotton suffers from high water retention and significant weight, but its low cost makes it an attractive option for uses like stationary camping or car camping where these drawbacks are of little consequence. Cotton insulation does not provide warmth if it becomes wet (due to the sleeping bag falling into water), so cotton-insulated sleeping bags are not used by professionals or serious hikers.\n\n==Temperature ratings==\n[[File:Israel 2 021 Sleeping Rucksack-Tourist.jpg|thumb|250px|A person in a sleeping bag]]\n\nIn [[Europe]], the [[EN 13537]] [[standardization|standard]] (introduced in 2005) normalizes the [[temperature]]s at which a sleeping bag is rated for use.

This is an extreme survival rating only and it is not advisable to rely on this rating for general use.\n\nThe ''transition zone'', in between the comfort and lower temperature, is usually considered as the best purchase guideline.\n\nA sleeping bag's rating typically indicates the lowest temperature at which it will keep the average sleeper warm. For example, with a 0\u00b0 bag, a person should be able to sleep in 0\u00b0 temperature, but not necessarily comfortably.\n[[File:Detske6.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Girls with sleeping bags at a [[sleepover]].]]\nThere is no standard measurement rating in the U.S., so a 20\u00b0 bag from one company may not provide the same warmth as a 20\u00b0 from another company.

In the thirty presidential elections between 1900 and 2016, twenty of the winning candidates have been taller than their opponents, while nine have been shorter, and one was the same height. On average the winner was {{convert|1.0|inch|cm}} taller than the loser.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nHowever, it may be argued that drawing the line at any date ignores the fact that pictorial depictions presidential hopefuls have been available to the American public at large well before debates were televised. [[Stereoscopy|Stereographs]] were widely used as a form of [[photojournalism]] for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stereographs|publisher=American Antiquarian Society|url=https://www.americanantiquarian.org/stereographs.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016174338/https://www.americanantiquarian.org/stereographs.htm|archive-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>. Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only ''once'' (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 21 taller vs 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2016). Considering that [[political cartoon]]s and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2016 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere {{convert|0.3|inch|cm}};<ref name=calctab>Using the values in the table {{oldid|Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States#Comparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates|941036573|''Comparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates'' (16 February 2020 version)}}, by pairing every winner with every losing candidate in the same election year where the height was known for all main opponents listed, the average (mean) amount by which the winner was taller than the loser was 0.29 inches. When excluding the 2016 election in order to eliminate gender as a variable (since [[Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#Size,_weight_and_body_shape|men are naturally taller than woman]]), the winner was only 0.12 inches taller on average, which, upon noting how all candidates are rounded to the nearest half-inch, rounds to a 0 inch difference.</ref> this average height difference becomes little more than a [[round-off error]]\u2014a mere {{convert|0.1|inch|cm}}\u2014when excluding the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], in which [[Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#Size,_weight_and_body_shape|gender not only accounted for the height difference]], but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.<ref name=calctab/>\n\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however. Examples of such views include:\n\n* In [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1953 dystopian novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', when Mildred and her friends talk about the success of one presidential candidate over the other in a recent election, they talk only about the attractiveness of the winning candidate over the loser. One of their points is \"You just don't go running a little short man like that against a tall man.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* A 1988 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' fashion section about a [[haberdasher]] devoted to clothing shorter men included a variation of the tale: \"Stern says he just learned that [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] is 5 feet, 8 inches. 'Did you know,' he adds, noticeably disappointed, 'that since 1900 the taller of the two candidates always wins?'\"<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', March 25, 1988, pg. 7</ref>\n* A 1997 book called ''How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You'' discusses the issue in a section about the importance of height: \"What about height?

Since 1776 only [two Presidents,] James Madison and Benjamin Harrison[,] have been below-average height.

In the thirty presidential elections between 1900 and 2016, twenty of the winning candidates have been taller than their opponents, while nine have been shorter, and one was the same height. On average the winner was {{convert|1.0|inch|cm}} taller than the loser.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nHowever, it may be argued that drawing the line at any date ignores the fact that pictorial depictions presidential hopefuls have been available to the American public at large well before debates were televised. [[Stereoscopy|Stereographs]] were widely used as a form of [[photojournalism]] for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stereographs|publisher=American Antiquarian Society|url=https://www.americanantiquarian.org/stereographs.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016174338/https://www.americanantiquarian.org/stereographs.htm|archive-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>. Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only ''once'' (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 21 taller vs 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2016). Considering that [[political cartoon]]s and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2016 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere {{convert|0.3|inch|cm}};<ref name=calctab>Using the values in the table {{oldid|Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States#Comparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates|941036573|''Comparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates'' (16 February 2020 version)}}, by pairing every winner with every losing candidate in the same election year where the height was known for all main opponents listed, the average (mean) amount by which the winner was taller than the loser was 0.29 inches. When excluding the 2016 election in order to eliminate gender as a variable (since [[Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#Size,_weight_and_body_shape|men are naturally taller than woman]]), the winner was only 0.12 inches taller on average, which, upon noting how all candidates are rounded to the nearest half-inch, rounds to a 0 inch difference.</ref> this average height difference becomes little more than a [[round-off error]]\u2014a mere {{convert|0.1|inch|cm}}\u2014when excluding the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], in which [[Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#Size,_weight_and_body_shape|gender not only accounted for the height difference]], but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.<ref name=calctab/>\n\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however. Examples of such views include:\n\n* In [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1953 dystopian novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', when Mildred and her friends talk about the success of one presidential candidate over the other in a recent election, they talk only about the attractiveness of the winning candidate over the loser. One of their points is \"You just don't go running a little short man like that against a tall man.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* A 1988 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' fashion section about a [[haberdasher]] devoted to clothing shorter men included a variation of the tale: \"Stern says he just learned that [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] is 5 feet, 8 inches. 'Did you know,' he adds, noticeably disappointed, 'that since 1900 the taller of the two candidates always wins?'\"<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', March 25, 1988, pg. 7</ref>\n* A 1997 book called ''How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You'' discusses the issue in a section about the importance of height: \"What about height?
