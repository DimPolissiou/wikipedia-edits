The Board of Inquiry (BoI) determined that the helicopter's crew had been flying at dangerously low levels, involving one incident whereby they all conspired to not report the fact that they were only {{convert|35|ft}} above ground level (AGL). The aircraft had just picked up 8 troops from the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] and was performing a fly-over of other troops in the regiment and then went into a turn that neither pilot was qualified to attempt. The Puma crashed into a field when its tail hit the ground coming out of the manoeuvre causing the entire airframe to hit the ground. The aircraft tumbled and the cockpit canopy sheared off completely. The pilot, crewman and one of the troops were killed.

The aircraft was being tested in readiness to be handed back to operational service after a lengthy maintenance programme, and the negative-g roll was used as a 'loose articles' check. The rear seat, which in normal service holds the Weapons System Operator (WSO) fell out through the canopy and was struck instantaneously by the tail-fin of the aircraft as it was travelling at {{convert|450|mph}}. The Board of Inquiry later determined that the main causal factor was that the seat had not been affixed to the aircraft properly. The WSO suffered fatal injuries when the seat came into contact with the tail-fin. The seat plummeted down to earth and landed near to [[South Creake]]; the pilot was unhurt and managed to recover the aircraft back to [[RAF Marham]] (its point of origin).<ref>{{cite web|title=Board on Inquiry into ZA554 incident|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27130/ZA554_boi_tornado_rpt.pdf|website=gov.uk|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=27 August 2017|page=11|date=9 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pilots 'unaware' of safety check on RAF Tornado jets|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-11585695|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=BBC News|date=20 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n;2009\n*2 July 2009 - ''ZE982'', a [[Tornado F3]] aircraft (of [[No. 43 Squadron RAF]]) from [[RAF Leuchars]], crashed into a hillside at [[Glen Kinglass|Glen Kinglas]], {{convert|1,198|ft}} above sea level.
