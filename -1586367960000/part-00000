The basement rock is primarily composed of metamorphosed [[limestone]] and [[schist]], which date from the Alpine Orogeny. These non-volcanic rocks are exposed at [[Mikro Profititis Ilias]], Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, [[Pyrgos Kallistis|Pyrgos]], [[Monolithos, Greece|Monolithos]], and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.\n\nThe metamorphic grade is a [[blueschist]] [[Metamorphic facies|facies]], which results from tectonic deformation by the [[subduction]] of the [[African Plate]] beneath the [[Eurasian Plate]].  Subduction occurred between the [[Oligocene]] and the [[Miocene]],  and the metamorphic grade represents the southernmost extent of the Cycladic blueschist belt.\n\n===Volcanism===\n\nVolcanism on Santorini is due to the [[Hellenic Trench]] [[subduction zone]] southwest of Crete.  The [[oceanic crust]] of the northern margin of the [[African Plate]] is being subducted under Greece and the Aegean Sea, which is thinned [[continental crust]]. The subduction compels the formation of the [[Hellenic arc]], which includes Santorini and other volcanic centres, such as [[Methana Volcano|Methana]], [[Milos]], and [[Kos]].<ref name=druitt>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Geological Society\n| isbn = 978-1-86239-048-5\n| volume = 19\n| last = Druitt\n| first = Timothy H. |author2=L.

The ground then slopes outwards and downwards towards the outer perimeter, and the outer beaches are smooth and shallow.  Beach sand colour depends on which geological layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colours: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach and the White Beach.  The water at the darker coloured beaches is significantly warmer because the lava acts as a heat absorber.\n\nThe area of Santorini incorporates a group of islands created by volcanoes, spanning across Thera, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palea, and Nea Kameni.\n\n[[File:Viewing Fira from Nea Kameni.JPG|thumb|Fira from [[Nea Kameni]] volcanic Island]]\n\nSantorini has erupted many times, with varying degrees of explosivity.  There have been at least twelve large explosive eruptions, of which at least four were [[caldera]]-forming.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  The most famous eruption is the [[Minoan eruption]], detailed below.  Eruptive products range from [[basalt]] all the way to [[rhyolite]], and the rhyolitic products are associated with the most explosive eruptions.\n\nThe earliest eruptions, many of which were [[submarine eruption|submarine]], were on the Akrotiri Peninsula, and active between 650,000 and 550,000 years ago.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  These are [[geochemistry|geochemically]] distinct from the later volcanism, as they contain [[amphibole]]s.\n\nOver the past 360,000 years there have been two major cycles, each culminating with two caldera-forming eruptions.  The cycles end when the magma evolves to a rhyolitic composition, causing the most explosive eruptions.  In between the caldera-forming eruptions are a series of sub-cycles.  Lava flows and small explosive eruptions build up [[volcanic cone|cones]], which are thought to impede the flow of magma to the surface.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  This allows the formation of large magma chambers, in which the magma can evolve to more [[silicic]] compositions.  Once this happens, a large explosive eruption destroys the cone.  The Kameni islands in the centre of the lagoon are the most recent example of a cone built by this volcano, with much of them hidden beneath the water.\n\n[[File:ISS017-E-5037 lrg.jpg|thumb|Recent aerial image of the volcano crater]]\n\n====Minoan eruption====\n{{Main|Minoan eruption}}\n\nThe devastating volcanic eruption of Thera has become the most famous single event in the Aegean before the fall of [[Troy]]. It may have been one of the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth in the last few thousand years, with an estimated VEI ([[volcanic explosivity index]]) of 6 according to the last studies published in 2006, confirming the prior values.\nThe violent eruption was centred on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the caldera; the caldera itself was formed several hundred thousand years ago by the collapse of the centre of a circular island, caused by the emptying of the magma chamber during an eruption. It has been filled several times by [[ignimbrite]] since then, and the process repeated itself, most recently 21,000 years ago. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcano, then collapsed once more during the Minoan eruption. Before the Minoan eruption, the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring with the only entrance between the tiny island of Aspronisi and Thera; the eruption destroyed the sections of the ring between Aspronisi and Therasia, and between Therasia and Thera, creating two new channels.\n\nOn Santorini, a deposit of white [[tephra]] thrown from the eruption is found lying up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick, overlying the soil marking the ground level before the eruption, and forming a layer divided into three fairly distinct bands indicating different phases of the eruption. Archaeological discoveries in 2006 by a team of international scientists revealed that the Santorini event was much more massive than previously thought; it expelled {{convert|61|km3|cumi}} of magma and rock into the Earth's atmosphere, compared to previous estimates of only {{convert|39|km3|cumi}} in 1991,<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/?id=3654 URI.edu<!-- Bot generated title -->], URI Department of Communications and Marketing</ref><ref name=\":1\">[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060823-thera-volcano.html NationalGeographic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], \"Atlantis\" Eruption Twice as Big as Previously Believed, Study Suggests.</ref> producing an estimated {{convert|100|km3|cumi}} of tephra.

The documentary presents this date as corresponding to the time of the Biblical [[Moses]]. The film asserts that the [[Hyksos]] were the Israelites and that some of them may have originally been from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]]. The film also suggests that these original Mycenaean Israelites fled Egypt (which they had in fact ruled for some time) after the eruption, and went back to Mycenae. The [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] is identified with [[Ahmose I]]. Rather than crossing the [[Red Sea]], Jacobovici argues a marshy area in northern Egypt known as the [[Reed Sea]]  would have been alternately drained and flooded by [[tsunami]]s caused by the caldera collapse, and could have been [[Passage of the Red Sea|crossed during the Exodus]].\n\nJacobovici's assertions in ''The Exodus Decoded'' have been extensively criticized by religious and other scholars.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|title= Debunking \"The Exodus Decoded\" |url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2006/09/Debunking-The-Exodus-Decoded.aspx|date= September 20, 2006 |website= |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{cite web|title= The Exodus Decoded: An Extended Review |url= http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=459|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012083435/http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=459|url-status= dead|archive-date= 12 October 2007|date= 19 Dec 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref>  In a 2013 book on this connection, ''Thera and the Exodus'', a dissident from the consensus [[Riaan Booysen]], tries to support Jacobovici's theory and claims the pharaoh of the Exodus to be [[Amenhotep III]] and the biblical Moses as [[Crown Prince Thutmose]], Amenhotep's first-born son and heir to his throne.<ref name=\":6\">Booysen, Riaan (2013), ''Thera and the Exodus'', O Books, {{ISBN|978-1-78099-449-9}}.</ref>\n\n=====Speculation on an Atlantis connection=====\n{{Main|Location hypotheses of Atlantis}}\n[[archeology|Archaeological]], [[seismology|seismological]], and [[vulcanology|vulcanological]] evidence<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|title=Santorini Eruption (~1630 BC) and the legend of Atlantis |url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/santorini.html |accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{cite news|title=Ye gods!

The possibility has been more recently popularized by television documentaries such as [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] programme ''Lost Worlds'' (episode \"Atlantis\"), the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Solving History with Olly Steeds]]'', and the BBC's ''Atlantis, The Evidence'',  which suggests that Thera is Plato's Atlantis.<ref name=\":10\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sl29f ''Atlantis \u2013 The Evidence'' by Bettany Hughes] BBC.co.uk, Timewatch</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Post-Minoan volcanism====\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n\nPost-Minoan eruptive activity is concentrated on the Kameni islands, in the centre of the lagoon.

The island was not known as Thera at this time. Only the southern tip of a large town has been uncovered, yet it has revealed complexes of multi-level buildings, streets, and squares with remains of walls standing as high as eight metres, all entombed in the solidified ash of the famous eruption of Thera. The site was not a palace-complex as found in [[Crete]], but neither was it a conglomeration of merchants' warehousing, as its excellent masonry and fine wall-paintings show. A loom-workshop suggests organized [[textile]] [[weaving]] for export. This [[Bronze Age]] civilization thrived between 3000 and 2000 BC, reaching its peak in the period between 2000 and 1630 BC.<ref>[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10846/akrotiri.html#fieldnotes TheModernAntiquarian.com], C. Michael Hogan, ''Akrotiri'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007).</ref>\n\nMany of the houses in Akrotiri are major structures, some of them three stories high. Its streets, squares, and walls were preserved in the layers of ejecta, sometimes as tall as eight metres, indicating this was a major town. In many houses stone staircases are still intact, and they contain huge ceramic storage jars ([[pithoi]]), mills, and pottery. Noted archaeological remains found in Akrotiri are wall paintings or [[fresco]]es, which have kept their original colour well, as they were preserved under many metres of volcanic ash. The town also had a highly developed drainage system and, judging from the fine artwork, its citizens were clearly sophisticated and relatively wealthy people.\n\nPipes with running water and [[water closet]]s found at Akrotiri are the oldest such utilities discovered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The pipes run in twin systems, indicating that Therans used both hot and cold water supplies; the origin of the hot water probably was [[geothermal power|geothermic]], given the [[volcano]]'s proximity. The dual pipe system, the advanced architecture, and the apparent layout of the Akrotiri find resemble [[Plato]]'s description of the legendary lost city of [[Atlantis]], further indicating the Minoans as the culture which primarily inspired the Atlantis legend.<ref name=pell/>\n\nFragmentary wall-paintings at Akrotiri lack the insistent religious or mythological content familiar in Classical Greek d\u00e9cor. Instead, the Minoan frescoes depict \"[[Saffron]]-Gatherers\", who offer their [[crocus]]-stamens to a seated lady, perhaps a [[goddess]]. Crocus has been discovered to have many medicinal values including the relief of menstrual pain. This has led many {{Who|date=June 2010}} archaeologists to believe that the fresco of the saffron/crocus gatherers is a coming of age fresco dealing with female pubescence. In another house are two [[antelopes]], painted with a kind of confident, flowing, decorative, calligraphic line, the famous fresco of a fisherman with his double strings of fish strung by their gills, and the flotilla of pleasure boats, accompanied by leaping [[dolphins]], where ladies take their ease in the shade of light canopies, among other frescoes.\n\nThe well preserved ruins of the ancient town are often compared to the spectacular ruins at [[Pompeii]] in Italy. The canopy covering the ruins collapsed in an accident in September 2005, killing one tourist and injuring seven more. The site was closed for almost seven years while a new canopy was built. The site was re-opened in April 2012.\n\nThe oldest signs of human settlement are Late [[Neolithic]] (4th millennium BC or earlier), but c. 2000\u20131650 BC Akrotiri developed into one of the Aegean's major [[Bronze Age]] ports, with recovered objects that came not just from [[Crete]], but also from [[Anatolia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], as well as from the [[Dodecanese]] and the Greek mainland.\n\n====Dating of the Bronze Age eruption====\n[[File:Stoa Basilica.jpg|thumb|Stoa Basilica of ancient Thera]]\n[[File:Santorini - Grecia - Vista Aerea del promontorio di Ancient Thira - agosto 2018.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the island of Santorini with detail of mount Profitis Illas and the ruins of ancient Thera (on the promontory on the left)]]\n\nThe [[Minoan eruption]] provides a fixed point for the chronology of the second millennium BC in the Aegean, because evidence of the eruption occurs throughout the region and the site itself contains material culture from outside.

At [[Knossos]], in a LMIIIA context (14th century BC), seven [[Linear B]] texts while calling upon \"all the gods\" make sure to grant primacy to an elsewhere-unattested entity called ''qe-ra-si-ja'' and, once, ''qe-ra-si-jo''. If the endings ''-ia[s]'' and ''-ios'' represent an ethnic suffix, then this means \"The One From Qeras[os]\". If the initial consonant were aspirated, then *Qhera- would have become \"Thera-\" in later Greek. \"Therasia\" and its ethnikon \"Therasios\" are both attested in later Greek; and, since ''-sos'' was itself a genitive suffix in the Aegean [[Sprachbund]], *Qeras[os] could also shrink to *Qera. An alternate view takes ''qe-ra-si-ja'' and ''qe-ra-si-jo'' as proof of androgyny, and applies this name by similar arguments to the legendary seer, [[Teiresias|Tiresias]], but these views are not mutually exclusive. If ''qe-ra-si-ja'' was an ethnikon first, then in following him/her/it the Cretans also feared whence it came.<ref>[http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/religionmyths/minoanqerasijathereligiousimpactofthetheravolcanoonminoancrete TheraFoundation.org], Minoan Qe-Ra-Si-Ja.

[[Herodotus]] reports that they called the island Callista and lived on it for eight generations.<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]] IV.147</ref>  In the 9th century BC, [[Dorians]] founded the main Hellenic city on Mesa Vouno, {{convert|396|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This group later claimed that they had named the city and the island after their leader, [[Theras]]. Today, that city is referred to as [[Ancient Thera]].\n\nIn his ''[[Argonautica]]'', written in Hellenistic Egypt in the 3rd century BC, [[Apollonius Rhodius]] includes an origin and sovereignty myth of Thera being given by [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] in Libya to the Greek [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] [[Euphemus]], son of [[Poseidon]], in the form of a clod of dirt. After carrying the dirt next to his heart for several days, Euphemus dreamt that he nursed the dirt with milk from his breast, and that the dirt turned into a beautiful woman with whom he had sex. The woman then told him that she was a daughter of Triton named Kalliste, and that when he threw the dirt into the sea it would grow into an island for his descendants to live on. The poem goes on to claim that the island was named Thera after Euphemus' descendant [[Theras]], son of [[Autesion]], the leader of a group of refugee settlers from [[Lemnos]].\n\nThe Dorians have left a number of inscriptions incised in stone, in the vicinity of the temple of [[Apollo]], attesting to [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic relations]] between the authors and their lovers ([[eromenos|eromenoi]]). These inscriptions, found by [[:de:Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen (Epigraphiker)|Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], have been thought by some archaeologists to be of a ritual, celebratory nature, because of their large size, careful construction and&nbsp;\u2013 in some cases&nbsp;\u2013 execution by craftsmen other than the authors. According to [[Herodotus]],<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]] IV.149\u2013165</ref> following a drought of seven years, Thera sent out colonists who founded a number of cities in northern Africa, including [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. In the 5th century BC, Dorian Thera did not join the [[Delian League]] with [[Athens]]; and during the [[Peloponnesian War]], Thera sided with Dorian Sparta, against Athens. The Athenians took the island during the war, but lost it again after the [[Battle of Aegospotami]]. During the Hellenistic period, the island was a major naval base for [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\n===Medieval and Ottoman period===\nAs with other Greek territories, Thera then was ruled by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided, the island passed to the eastern side of the Empire which today is known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Following the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] on the Greek mainland in March 1821, in May Santorini followed suit, although the local Catholic population had its reservations. The island became part of the fledgling Greek state, rebelled against Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] in 1831, and became definitively part of the independent [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, with the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]].<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\nThe island is still home to a Catholic community and the seat of a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santorini|Catholic bishopric]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Santorini was occupied in 1941 by Italian forces,  and in 1943 by those of the Germans. In 1944, the German and Italian garrison on [[Raid on Santorini|Santorini was raided]] by a group of British [[Special Boat Service]] Commandos, killing most of its men.

Until the early 1990s locals filled water cisterns from the rain that fell on roofs and courts, from small springs, and with imported assistance from other areas of Greece. In recent years a [[desalination]] plant has provided running, yet non-potable, water to most houses.  Since rain is rare on the island from mid-spring to mid-autumn, many plants depend on the scant moisture provided by the common, early morning fog condensing on the ground as [[dew]].\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Fava (3711746562).jpg|thumb|Sacks with [[fava Santorinis]]]]\n\nBecause of its unique ecology and climate, and especially its volcanic ash soil, Santorini is home to unique and prized produce.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Wine industry===\n{{Main|Santorini (wine)}}\n\nThe island remains the home of a small, but flourishing, [[wine]] industry, based on the indigenous [[grape]] variety, [[Assyrtiko]], with auxiliary cultivations of two other Aegean varietals, ''[[Athiri]]'' and ''[[Aidani]]''.  The vines are extremely old and resistant to [[phylloxera]] (attributed by local winemakers to the well-drained volcanic soil and its chemistry), so the vines needed no replacement during the great [[phylloxera epidemic]] of the late 19th century. In their adaptation to their habitat, such vines are planted far apart, as their principal source of moisture is dew, and they often are [[trained (vine)|trained]] in the shape of low-spiralling baskets, with the grapes hanging inside to protect them from the winds.\n\nThe viticultural pride of the island is the sweet and strong ''Vinsanto'' ({{lang-it|\"holy wine\"}}) (Visanto), a dessert wine made from the best sun-dried ''Assyrtiko'', ''Athiri'', and ''Aidani'' grapes, and undergoing long barrel aging (up to twenty or twenty-five years for the top ''cuv\u00e9es''). It matures to a sweet, dark amber-orange, unctuous dessert wine that has achieved worldwide fame, possessing the standard Assyrtiko aromas of citrus and minerals, layered with overtones of nuts, raisins, figs, honey and tea.\n\n[[File:Houses on the caldera, Santorini.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Houses built on the edge of the [[Santorini caldera|caldera]]]]\n[[File:Kasteli001.jpg|thumb|[[Emporio, Santorini|Emporeio]] village]]\n[[File:Imerovigli 02.jpg|thumb|View of [[Imerovigli]], example of [[Cycladic architecture]]]]\n\nWhite wines from the island are extremely dry with a strong, citrus scent and mineral and iodide salt aromas contributed by the ashy volcanic soil, whereas barrel aging gives to some of the white wines a slight [[frankincense]] aroma, much like Vinsanto. It is not easy to be a winegrower in Santorini; the hot and dry conditions give the soil a very low productivity. The yield per hectare is only 10 to 20% of the yields that are common in [[France]] or [[California]].  The island's wines are standardised and protected by the \"Vinsanto\" and \"Santorini\" [[Protected designation of origin#Wines|OPAP]] designations of origin.<ref name=\"GREECE SANTORINI HISTORY\">{{Cite web|title = Greece Santorini History|url = http://www.greecesantorini.com/santorinihistory2.htm|website = www.greecesantorini.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\nA brewery, the [[Santorini Brewing Company]], began operating out of Santorini in 2011, based in the island's wine region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/01/16/greeces-handcrafted-beers-hit-the-spot/|title=Greece's Handcrafted Beers Hit the Spot {{!}} GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n\nThe traditional architecture of Santorini is similar to that of the other [[Cyclades]], with low-lying cubical houses, made of local stone and [[whitewash]]ed or limewashed with various volcanic ashes used as colours.  The unique characteristic is the common utilisation of the ''hyp\u00f3skapha'': extensions of houses dug sideways or downwards into the surrounding [[pumice]].  These rooms are prized because of the high insulation provided by the air-filled pumice, and are used as living quarters of unique coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. These are premium storage space for produce,  especially for wine cellaring: the ''K\u00e1nava'' wineries of Santorini.\n\nWhen strong earthquakes struck the island in 1956, half the buildings were completely destroyed and a large number suffered repairable damage. The underground dwellings along the ridge overlooking the caldera, where the instability of the soil was responsible for the great extent of the damage, needed to be evacuated. Most of the population of Santorini had to emigrate to Piraeus and Athens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://users.ntua.gr/kamy/istanbul.pdf|title=Restoration, Reconstruction and Simulacra}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Themison of Thera]]\n*[[Spyros Markezinis]], politician\n*[[Mariza Koch]], singer\n*[[Giannis Alafouzos]], former president of [[Panathinaikos F.C.]]\n\n== Popular Culture==\nThe island was featured in The 2005 film \u201dThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u201c.\n\n[[Santorini Film Festival]] held annually at the open air cinema, Cinema Kamari in Santorini.<ref>{{cite web |title=Santorini Film Festival |url=https://filmfreeway.com/SantoriniFilmFestival |website=FilmFreeway |accessdate=27 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Santorini cruise ships in caldera.jpg|thumbnail|Ferry and cruise ship in the caldera 2013]]\n\n===Land===\nBus services link Fira to most parts of the island.<ref>{{cite web |title=Santorini Public Buses |url=https://www.ktel-santorini.gr/index.php/en/ |website=www.ktel-santorini.gr}}</ref>\n\n===Ports===\nSantorini has two ports: [[Athinios (Santorini)|Athinios]] (Ferry Port) and Skala (Old Port).<ref>Santorini Port Authority http://www.santorini-port.com</ref> Cruise ships anchor off Skala and passengers are transferred by local boatmen to shore at Skala where Fira is accessed by [[Santorini cable car|cable car]], on foot or by donkey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greek-island-accused-of-abusing-its-star-attraction-donkeys/a-49480177|title=Greek island accused of abusing its star attraction: donkeys|date=2019-07-08|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> Tour boats depart from Skala for Nea Kameni and other Santorini destinations.<ref>Santorini Port Authority http://www.santoriniport.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Santorini Airport.JPG|left|Santorini airport viewed from ancient Thera.|thumb]]\n\n===Airport===\n\n{{see also|Santorini (Thira) International Airport}}\nSantorini is one of the few [[Cyclades]] Islands with a major airport, which lies about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of downtown Thera.

Agriculture also forms part of its economy, and the island sustains a wine industry, based on the indigenous [[Assyrtiko]] grape variety. White varieties also include Athiri and Aidani, whereas red varieties include mavrotragano and mandilaria.\n\n==Geology==\n{{main|Santorini caldera}}\n\n===Geological setting===\n\nThe Cyclades are part of a [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] complex that is known as the [[Cycladic Massif]].  The complex formed during the [[Miocene]] and was folded and metamorphosed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] around 60 million years ago. Thera is built upon a small, non-volcanic [[Basement rock|basement]] that represents the former non-volcanic island, which was approximately {{convert|9|by|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The basement rock is primarily composed of metamorphosed [[limestone]] and [[schist]], which date from the Alpine Orogeny. These non-volcanic rocks are exposed at [[Mikro Profititis Ilias]], Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, [[Pyrgos Kallistis|Pyrgos]], [[Monolithos, Greece|Monolithos]], and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.\n\nThe metamorphic grade is a [[blueschist]] [[Metamorphic facies|facies]], which results from tectonic deformation by the [[subduction]] of the [[African Plate]] beneath the [[Eurasian Plate]].  Subduction occurred between the [[Oligocene]] and the [[Miocene]],  and the metamorphic grade represents the southernmost extent of the Cycladic blueschist belt.\n\n===Volcanism===\n\nVolcanism on Santorini is due to the [[Hellenic Trench]] [[subduction zone]] southwest of Crete.  The [[oceanic crust]] of the northern margin of the [[African Plate]] is being subducted under Greece and the Aegean Sea, which is thinned [[continental crust]]. The subduction compels the formation of the [[Hellenic arc]], which includes Santorini and other volcanic centres, such as [[Methana Volcano|Methana]], [[Milos]], and [[Kos]].<ref name=druitt>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Geological Society\n| isbn = 978-1-86239-048-5\n| volume = 19\n| last = Druitt\n| first = Timothy H. |author2=L.

The ground then slopes outwards and downwards towards the outer perimeter, and the outer beaches are smooth and shallow.  Beach sand colour depends on which geological layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colours: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach and the White Beach.  The water at the darker coloured beaches is significantly warmer because the lava acts as a heat absorber.\n\nThe area of Santorini incorporates a group of islands created by volcanoes, spanning across Thera, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palea, and Nea Kameni.\n\n[[File:Viewing Fira from Nea Kameni.JPG|thumb|Fira from [[Nea Kameni]] volcanic Island]]\n\nSantorini has erupted many times, with varying degrees of explosivity.  There have been at least twelve large explosive eruptions, of which at least four were [[caldera]]-forming.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  The most famous eruption is the [[Minoan eruption]], detailed below.  Eruptive products range from [[basalt]] all the way to [[rhyolite]], and the rhyolitic products are associated with the most explosive eruptions.\n\nThe earliest eruptions, many of which were [[submarine eruption|submarine]], were on the Akrotiri Peninsula, and active between 650,000 and 550,000 years ago.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  These are [[geochemistry|geochemically]] distinct from the later volcanism, as they contain [[amphibole]]s.\n\nOver the past 360,000 years there have been two major cycles, each culminating with two caldera-forming eruptions.  The cycles end when the magma evolves to a rhyolitic composition, causing the most explosive eruptions.  In between the caldera-forming eruptions are a series of sub-cycles.  Lava flows and small explosive eruptions build up [[volcanic cone|cones]], which are thought to impede the flow of magma to the surface.<ref name=\"druitt\" />  This allows the formation of large magma chambers, in which the magma can evolve to more [[silicic]] compositions.  Once this happens, a large explosive eruption destroys the cone.  The Kameni islands in the centre of the lagoon are the most recent example of a cone built by this volcano, with much of them hidden beneath the water.\n\n[[File:ISS017-E-5037 lrg.jpg|thumb|Recent aerial image of the volcano crater]]\n\n====Minoan eruption====\n{{Main|Minoan eruption}}\n\nThe devastating volcanic eruption of Thera has become the most famous single event in the Aegean before the fall of [[Troy]]. It may have been one of the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth in the last few thousand years, with an estimated VEI ([[volcanic explosivity index]]) of 6 according to the last studies published in 2006, confirming the prior values.\nThe violent eruption was centred on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the caldera; the caldera itself was formed several hundred thousand years ago by the collapse of the centre of a circular island, caused by the emptying of the magma chamber during an eruption. It has been filled several times by [[ignimbrite]] since then, and the process repeated itself, most recently 21,000 years ago. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcano, then collapsed once more during the Minoan eruption. Before the Minoan eruption, the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring with the only entrance between the tiny island of Aspronisi and Thera; the eruption destroyed the sections of the ring between Aspronisi and Therasia, and between Therasia and Thera, creating two new channels.\n\nOn Santorini, a deposit of white [[tephra]] thrown from the eruption is found lying up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick, overlying the soil marking the ground level before the eruption, and forming a layer divided into three fairly distinct bands indicating different phases of the eruption. Archaeological discoveries in 2006 by a team of international scientists revealed that the Santorini event was much more massive than previously thought; it expelled {{convert|61|km3|cumi}} of magma and rock into the Earth's atmosphere, compared to previous estimates of only {{convert|39|km3|cumi}} in 1991,<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/?id=3654 URI.edu<!-- Bot generated title -->], URI Department of Communications and Marketing</ref><ref name=\":1\">[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060823-thera-volcano.html NationalGeographic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], \"Atlantis\" Eruption Twice as Big as Previously Believed, Study Suggests.</ref> producing an estimated {{convert|100|km3|cumi}} of tephra.

The documentary presents this date as corresponding to the time of the Biblical [[Moses]]. The film asserts that the [[Hyksos]] were the Israelites and that some of them may have originally been from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]]. The film also suggests that these original Mycenaean Israelites fled Egypt (which they had in fact ruled for some time) after the eruption, and went back to Mycenae. The [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] is identified with [[Ahmose I]]. Rather than crossing the [[Red Sea]], Jacobovici argues a marshy area in northern Egypt known as the [[Reed Sea]]  would have been alternately drained and flooded by [[tsunami]]s caused by the caldera collapse, and could have been [[Passage of the Red Sea|crossed during the Exodus]].\n\nJacobovici's assertions in ''The Exodus Decoded'' have been extensively criticized by religious and other scholars.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|title= Debunking \"The Exodus Decoded\" |url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2006/09/Debunking-The-Exodus-Decoded.aspx|date= September 20, 2006 |website= |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{cite web|title= The Exodus Decoded: An Extended Review |url= http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=459|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012083435/http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=459|url-status= dead|archive-date= 12 October 2007|date= 19 Dec 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref>  In a 2013 book on this connection, ''Thera and the Exodus'', a dissident from the consensus [[Riaan Booysen]], tries to support Jacobovici's theory and claims the pharaoh of the Exodus to be [[Amenhotep III]] and the biblical Moses as [[Crown Prince Thutmose]], Amenhotep's first-born son and heir to his throne.<ref name=\":6\">Booysen, Riaan (2013), ''Thera and the Exodus'', O Books, {{ISBN|978-1-78099-449-9}}.</ref>\n\n=====Speculation on an Atlantis connection=====\n{{Main|Location hypotheses of Atlantis}}\n[[archeology|Archaeological]], [[seismology|seismological]], and [[vulcanology|vulcanological]] evidence<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|title=Santorini Eruption (~1630 BC) and the legend of Atlantis |url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/santorini.html |accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{cite news|title=Ye gods!

The possibility has been more recently popularized by television documentaries such as [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] programme ''Lost Worlds'' (episode \"Atlantis\"), the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Solving History with Olly Steeds]]'', and the BBC's ''Atlantis, The Evidence'',  which suggests that Thera is Plato's Atlantis.<ref name=\":10\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sl29f ''Atlantis \u2013 The Evidence'' by Bettany Hughes] BBC.co.uk, Timewatch</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Post-Minoan volcanism====\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n\nPost-Minoan eruptive activity is concentrated on the Kameni islands, in the centre of the lagoon.

The island was not known as Thera at this time. Only the southern tip of a large town has been uncovered, yet it has revealed complexes of multi-level buildings, streets, and squares with remains of walls standing as high as eight metres, all entombed in the solidified ash of the famous eruption of Thera. The site was not a palace-complex as found in [[Crete]], but neither was it a conglomeration of merchants' warehousing, as its excellent masonry and fine wall-paintings show. A loom-workshop suggests organized [[textile]] [[weaving]] for export. This [[Bronze Age]] civilization thrived between 3000 and 2000 BC, reaching its peak in the period between 2000 and 1630 BC.<ref>[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10846/akrotiri.html#fieldnotes TheModernAntiquarian.com], C. Michael Hogan, ''Akrotiri'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007).</ref>\n\nMany of the houses in Akrotiri are major structures, some of them three stories high. Its streets, squares, and walls were preserved in the layers of ejecta, sometimes as tall as eight metres, indicating this was a major town. In many houses stone staircases are still intact, and they contain huge ceramic storage jars ([[pithoi]]), mills, and pottery. Noted archaeological remains found in Akrotiri are wall paintings or [[fresco]]es, which have kept their original colour well, as they were preserved under many metres of volcanic ash. The town also had a highly developed drainage system and, judging from the fine artwork, its citizens were clearly sophisticated and relatively wealthy people.\n\nPipes with running water and [[water closet]]s found at Akrotiri are the oldest such utilities discovered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The pipes run in twin systems, indicating that Therans used both hot and cold water supplies; the origin of the hot water probably was [[geothermal power|geothermic]], given the [[volcano]]'s proximity. The dual pipe system, the advanced architecture, and the apparent layout of the Akrotiri find resemble [[Plato]]'s description of the legendary lost city of [[Atlantis]], further indicating the Minoans as the culture which primarily inspired the Atlantis legend.<ref name=pell/>\n\nFragmentary wall-paintings at Akrotiri lack the insistent religious or mythological content familiar in Classical Greek d\u00e9cor. Instead, the Minoan frescoes depict \"[[Saffron]]-Gatherers\", who offer their [[crocus]]-stamens to a seated lady, perhaps a [[goddess]]. Crocus has been discovered to have many medicinal values including the relief of menstrual pain. This has led many {{Who|date=June 2010}} archaeologists to believe that the fresco of the saffron/crocus gatherers is a coming of age fresco dealing with female pubescence. In another house are two [[antelopes]], painted with a kind of confident, flowing, decorative, calligraphic line, the famous fresco of a fisherman with his double strings of fish strung by their gills, and the flotilla of pleasure boats, accompanied by leaping [[dolphins]], where ladies take their ease in the shade of light canopies, among other frescoes.\n\nThe well preserved ruins of the ancient town are often compared to the spectacular ruins at [[Pompeii]] in Italy. The canopy covering the ruins collapsed in an accident in September 2005, killing one tourist and injuring seven more. The site was closed for almost seven years while a new canopy was built. The site was re-opened in April 2012.\n\nThe oldest signs of human settlement are Late [[Neolithic]] (4th millennium BC or earlier), but c. 2000\u20131650 BC Akrotiri developed into one of the Aegean's major [[Bronze Age]] ports, with recovered objects that came not just from [[Crete]], but also from [[Anatolia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], as well as from the [[Dodecanese]] and the Greek mainland.\n\n====Dating of the Bronze Age eruption====\n[[File:Stoa Basilica.jpg|thumb|Stoa Basilica of ancient Thera]]\n[[File:Santorini - Grecia - Vista Aerea del promontorio di Ancient Thira - agosto 2018.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the island of Santorini with detail of mount Profitis Illas and the ruins of ancient Thera (on the promontory on the left)]]\n\nThe [[Minoan eruption]] provides a fixed point for the chronology of the second millennium BC in the Aegean, because evidence of the eruption occurs throughout the region and the site itself contains material culture from outside.

At [[Knossos]], in a LMIIIA context (14th century BC), seven [[Linear B]] texts while calling upon \"all the gods\" make sure to grant primacy to an elsewhere-unattested entity called ''qe-ra-si-ja'' and, once, ''qe-ra-si-jo''. If the endings ''-ia[s]'' and ''-ios'' represent an ethnic suffix, then this means \"The One From Qeras[os]\". If the initial consonant were aspirated, then *Qhera- would have become \"Thera-\" in later Greek. \"Therasia\" and its ethnikon \"Therasios\" are both attested in later Greek; and, since ''-sos'' was itself a genitive suffix in the Aegean [[Sprachbund]], *Qeras[os] could also shrink to *Qera. An alternate view takes ''qe-ra-si-ja'' and ''qe-ra-si-jo'' as proof of androgyny, and applies this name by similar arguments to the legendary seer, [[Teiresias|Tiresias]], but these views are not mutually exclusive. If ''qe-ra-si-ja'' was an ethnikon first, then in following him/her/it the Cretans also feared whence it came.<ref>[http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/religionmyths/minoanqerasijathereligiousimpactofthetheravolcanoonminoancrete TheraFoundation.org], Minoan Qe-Ra-Si-Ja.

[[Herodotus]] reports that they called the island Callista and lived on it for eight generations.<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]] IV.147</ref>  In the 9th century BC, [[Dorians]] founded the main Hellenic city on Mesa Vouno, {{convert|396|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This group later claimed that they had named the city and the island after their leader, [[Theras]]. Today, that city is referred to as [[Ancient Thera]].\n\nIn his ''[[Argonautica]]'', written in Hellenistic Egypt in the 3rd century BC, [[Apollonius Rhodius]] includes an origin and sovereignty myth of Thera being given by [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] in Libya to the Greek [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] [[Euphemus]], son of [[Poseidon]], in the form of a clod of dirt. After carrying the dirt next to his heart for several days, Euphemus dreamt that he nursed the dirt with milk from his breast, and that the dirt turned into a beautiful woman with whom he had sex. The woman then told him that she was a daughter of Triton named Kalliste, and that when he threw the dirt into the sea it would grow into an island for his descendants to live on. The poem goes on to claim that the island was named Thera after Euphemus' descendant [[Theras]], son of [[Autesion]], the leader of a group of refugee settlers from [[Lemnos]].\n\nThe Dorians have left a number of inscriptions incised in stone, in the vicinity of the temple of [[Apollo]], attesting to [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic relations]] between the authors and their lovers ([[eromenos|eromenoi]]). These inscriptions, found by [[:de:Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen (Epigraphiker)|Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], have been thought by some archaeologists to be of a ritual, celebratory nature, because of their large size, careful construction and&nbsp;\u2013 in some cases&nbsp;\u2013 execution by craftsmen other than the authors. According to [[Herodotus]],<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]] IV.149\u2013165</ref> following a drought of seven years, Thera sent out colonists who founded a number of cities in northern Africa, including [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. In the 5th century BC, Dorian Thera did not join the [[Delian League]] with [[Athens]]; and during the [[Peloponnesian War]], Thera sided with Dorian Sparta, against Athens. The Athenians took the island during the war, but lost it again after the [[Battle of Aegospotami]]. During the Hellenistic period, the island was a major naval base for [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\n===Medieval and Ottoman period===\nAs with other Greek territories, Thera then was ruled by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided, the island passed to the eastern side of the Empire which today is known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Until the early 1990s locals filled water cisterns from the rain that fell on roofs and courts, from small springs, and with imported assistance from other areas of Greece. In recent years a [[desalination]] plant has provided running, yet non-potable, water to most houses.  Since rain is rare on the island from mid-spring till mid-autumn, many plants depend on the scant moisture provided by the common, early morning fog condensing on the ground as [[dew]].\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Fava (3711746562).jpg|thumb|Sacks with [[fava Santorinis]]]]\n\nBecause of its unique ecology and climate, and especially its volcanic ash soil, Santorini is home to unique and prized produce.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Wine industry===\n{{Main|Santorini (wine)}}\n\nThe island remains the home of a small, but flourishing, [[wine]] industry, based on the indigenous [[grape]] variety, [[Assyrtiko]], with auxiliary cultivations of two other Aegean varietals, ''[[Athiri]]'' and ''[[Aidani]]''.  The vines are extremely old and resistant to [[phylloxera]] (attributed by local winemakers to the well-drained volcanic soil and its chemistry), so the vines needed no replacement during the great [[phylloxera epidemic]] of the late 19th century. In their adaptation to their habitat, such vines are planted far apart, as their principal source of moisture is dew, and they often are [[trained (vine)|trained]] in the shape of low-spiralling baskets, with the grapes hanging inside to protect them from the winds.\n\nThe viticultural pride of the island is the sweet and strong ''Vinsanto'' ({{lang-it|\"holy wine\"}}) (Visanto), a dessert wine made from the best sun-dried ''Assyrtiko'', ''Athiri'', and ''Aidani'' grapes, and undergoing long barrel aging (up to twenty or twenty-five years for the top ''cuv\u00e9es''). It matures to a sweet, dark amber-orange, unctuous dessert wine that has achieved worldwide fame, possessing the standard Assyrtiko aromas of citrus and minerals, layered with overtones of nuts, raisins, figs, honey and tea.\n\n[[File:Houses on the caldera, Santorini.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Houses built on the edge of the [[Santorini caldera|caldera]]]]\n[[File:Kasteli001.jpg|thumb|[[Emporio, Santorini|Emporeio]] village]]\n[[File:Imerovigli 02.jpg|thumb|View of [[Imerovigli]], example of [[Cycladic architecture]]]]\n\nWhite wines from the island are extremely dry with a strong, citrus scent and mineral and iodide salt aromas contributed by the ashy volcanic soil, whereas barrel aging gives to some of the white wines a slight [[frankincense]] aroma, much like Vinsanto. It is not easy to be a winegrower in Santorini; the hot and dry conditions give the soil a very low productivity. The yield per hectare is only 10 to 20% of the yields that are common in [[France]] or [[California]].  The island's wines are standardised and protected by the \"Vinsanto\" and \"Santorini\" [[Protected designation of origin#Wines|OPAP]] designations of origin.<ref name=\"GREECE SANTORINI HISTORY\">{{Cite web|title = Greece Santorini History|url = http://www.greecesantorini.com/santorinihistory2.htm|website = www.greecesantorini.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\nA brewery, the [[Santorini Brewing Company]], began operating out of Santorini in 2011, based in the island's wine region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/01/16/greeces-handcrafted-beers-hit-the-spot/|title=Greece's Handcrafted Beers Hit the Spot {{!}} GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n\nThe traditional architecture of Santorini is similar to that of the other [[Cyclades]], with low-lying cubical houses, made of local stone and [[whitewash]]ed or limewashed with various volcanic ashes used as colours.  The unique characteristic is the common utilisation of the ''hyp\u00f3skapha'': extensions of houses dug sideways or downwards into the surrounding [[pumice]].  These rooms are prized because of the high insulation provided by the air-filled pumice, and are used as living quarters of unique coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. These are premium storage space for produce,  especially for wine cellaring: the ''K\u00e1nava'' wineries of Santorini.\n\nWhen strong earthquakes struck the island in 1956, half the buildings were completely destroyed and a large number suffered repairable damage. The underground dwellings along the ridge overlooking the caldera, where the instability of the soil was responsible for the great extent of the damage, needed to be evacuated.

The rest of the Croats stayed over near Francia, and are now called the Belocroats, that is, the White Croats, and have their own archon; they are subject to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the great king of Francia, which is also Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia, a part split off and took rule of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]]. They too had an independent archon, who would maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the archon of Croatia...

of the Croats could be seen archaic religion and mythology - the worship of the Slavic [[solar deity]] Hors (Sun, heavenly fire, force, war{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=79}}), which is of Iranian origin.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|pp=67\u201382, 109\u2013111}}\n\n====Origo gentis and etymology====\nThe legend about five brothers and two sisters recorded in Constantine VII's work ''De Administrando Imperio'' was probably part of an oral tradition,{{sfn|Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|1991|pp=53, 56}} which contradicts the role of [[Heraclius]] in the arrival of Croats to Dalmatia.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=95}} It is similar to other medieval ''origo gentis'' stories (see for e.g. ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''),{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=95}} and some consider it has the same source as the story of [[Bulgars]] recorded by [[Theophanes the Confessor]] in which the Bulgars subjugated [[Seven Slavic tribes]],{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=89}} and similarly, [[Thomas the Archdeacon]] in his work ''[[Historia Salonitana]]'' mentions that seven or eight tribes of nobles, who he called \"Lingones\", arrived from present-day [[Poland]] and settled in Croatia under Totila's leadership.{{sfn|Her\u0161ak|Nik\u0161i\u0107|2007|p=259}}{{sfn|Alimov|2015|p=153}} In this legend is also possibly reflected a migration of seven tribes.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=222}} Curiously, Croats are seemingly the only Slavic people who had a [[saga]] about the period of their migration.{{sfn|Alimov|2015|p=142}} Also, compared to other medieval stories none of them mentions female personalities, which could indicate a different social organization or different tribes who joined the Croats.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=97}} For example, [[Henryk \u0141owmia\u0144ski]] considered the [[Mazovians]], Dulebes, Croats and [[Veleti]] among the oldest Slavic tribes because Mazovians ethnonym was often related to [[Amazons]] (''-maz-'') while the land of women in North Europe was mentioned by [[Paul the Deacon]], [[Alfred the Great]], as well women's city West of Russian lands by [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]].{{sfn|Sedov|2013|p=481}} Another vagueness is a reason and meaning that one of the brothers had a Croatian ethnonym as a name, perhaps indicating he was more important than the other brothers or that the Croats were only one identity among others with which the Adriatic Croats tried to bring legitimacy to the Croatian Kingdom.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=97}}\n\nThe origin of the names of five brothers and two sisters are a matter of dispute. They are often considered to be of non-Slavic origin,{{sfn|Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|1991|pp=53, 56}} and genuine names, as the anonymous Slavic narrator (probably a Croat) couldn't invent the non-Slavic names of their ancestors in the 9th century.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2012|p=114}} [[J.J.

was the presumed territory by the White Croats and Zlicans, as well among Dulebes in the South, and Moravians in the East.{{sfn|Sedov|2013|pp=430, 435\u2013437}}\n\n====Religion====\nCroatian tribes were like other Slavs [[Slavic mythology|polytheists]] - [[Paganism|pagans]].{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=143}} Their worldview intertwined with worship of power and war, to which raised places of worship, and demolished those of others.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|pp=144, 146}} These worships were in contrast to [[Christianity]], and conflict when Christianism became official ideology among the Slavs.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=144}} The White Croats at the earliest historical sources are mentioned as pagans, and they were similar to the inhabitants of [[Kievan Rus']] who also received Christianity late (988).{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|pp=145, 147}} Slavs often related places of worship with the natural environment, like hills, forests, and water.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=145}} Some argue that Przemy\u015bl was their as well as Slavic bishops capital in the 9th-century because there were uncovered foundations of a round chapel and palace made of cut stone.{{sfn|Struk|1993|p=841}} According to Nestor, [[Vladimir the Great]] in 980 raised on a hill near his fort [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of Slavic gods; [[Perun]], [[Deities of Slavic religion#Sun-god and moon-god|Hors]], [[Da\u017ebog]], [[Stribog]], [[Simargl]], and [[Mokosh]],{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=123}} but as he converted to Christianity in 988 one of the probable reasons Vladimir attacked Croats in 992 was because they didn't want to abandon their old beliefs and accept Christianity.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=123}} Some scholars derived Croatian ethnonym from the Iranian word for Sun - ''[[Hvare-khshaeta|hvar]]''.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=59}}{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=92}} Pa\u0161\u010denko argued possibility that in the ethnonym of the Croats could be seen archaic religion and mythology - the worship of the Slavic [[solar deity]] Hors (Sun, heavenly fire, force, war{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|p=79}}), which is of Iranian origin.{{sfn|Pa\u0161\u010denko|2006|pp=67\u201382, 109\u2013111}}\n\n====Origo gentis and etymology====\nThe legend about five brothers and two sisters recorded in Constantine VII's work ''De Administrando Imperio'' was probably part of an oral tradition,{{sfn|Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|1991|pp=53, 56}} which contradicts the role of [[Heraclius]] in the arrival of Croats to Dalmatia.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=95}} It is similar to other medieval ''origo gentis'' stories (see for e.g. ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''),{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=95}} and some consider it has the same source as the story of [[Bulgars]] recorded by [[Theophanes the Confessor]] in which the Bulgars subjugated [[Seven Slavic tribes]],{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=89}} and similarly, [[Thomas the Archdeacon]] in his work ''[[Historia Salonitana]]'' mentions that seven or eight tribes of nobles, who he called \"Lingones\", arrived from present-day [[Poland]] and settled in Croatia under Totila's leadership.{{sfn|Her\u0161ak|Nik\u0161i\u0107|2007|p=259}}{{sfn|Alimov|2015|p=153}} In this legend is also possibly reflected a migration of seven tribes.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=222}} Curiously, Croats are seemingly the only Slavic people who had a [[saga]] about the period of their migration.{{sfn|Alimov|2015|p=142}} Also, compared to other medieval stories none of them mentions female personalities, which could indicate a different social organization or different tribes who joined the Croats.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=97}} For example, [[Henryk \u0141owmia\u0144ski]] considered the [[Mazovians]], Dulebes, Croats and [[Veleti]] among the oldest Slavic tribes because Mazovians ethnonym was often related to [[Amazons]] (''-maz-'') while the land of women in North Europe was mentioned by [[Paul the Deacon]], [[Alfred the Great]], as well women's city West of Russian lands by [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]].{{sfn|Sedov|2013|p=481}} Another vagueness is a reason and meaning that one of the brothers had a Croatian ethnonym as a name, perhaps indicating he was more important than the other brothers or that the Croats were only one identity among others with which the Adriatic Croats tried to bring legitimacy to the Croatian Kingdom.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=97}}\n\nThe origin of the names of five brothers and two sisters are a matter of dispute. They are often considered to be of non-Slavic origin,{{sfn|Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|1991|pp=53, 56}} and genuine names, as the anonymous Slavic narrator (probably a Croat) couldn't invent the non-Slavic names of their ancestors in the 9th century.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2012|p=114}} [[J.J.
