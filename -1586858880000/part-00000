In 1976, he managed to sell the idea to the [[BBC]], and the children's drama executive [[Anna Home]] commissioned an initial series of nine episodes in a trial run, the first being broadcast on 8 February 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/grangehill.htm |title=GRANGE HILL \u2013 A TELEVISION HEAVEN REVIEW |publisher=[[TV Heaven]] |accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Lysons|first=Jon|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/461091/ |title=Grange Hill (1978\u20132008) |publisher=BFI Screen Online |accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start, the series caused controversy for its real-life, gritty portrayal of [[school story|school life]], which differed from the idealised portrayals of earlier school [[drama]]s. Redmond has said that he wasn't really able to start pushing the boundaries until later series.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This led to Redmond being summoned to lunch by BBC bosses and forced to agree that there would be no further series unless he toned things down. ''Grange Hill'''s highest-profile period was undoubtedly the mid- to late 1980s. One of the most famous storylines during this time was that of [[Zammo McGuire]], played by [[Lee MacDonald]], and his addiction to [[heroin]]. This storyline ran over two series (1986\u201387) and focused on Zammo's descent into drugs and how it strained his relationship with girlfriend Jackie and friend Kevin. The show's other favourite characters during this period were Gonch and Hollo, played by John Holmes and Bradley Sheppard. During his time at the school (1985\u201389) Gonch took part in many moneymaking schemes, most of which were unsuccessful. There was a comedic element to the duo's relationship that worked well with viewers. Script editor [[Anthony Minghella]], who worked on the series for several years during the 1980s, later won an [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for the film ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' in 1996.\n\nDuring the 1990s, ''Grange Hill'' did not receive the same media attention that it had had just a few years before. The teachers were now equals in the narrative, with their personal lives taking up almost as much time as those of the pupils. In 1994, two characters were introduced with [[disability|disabilities]]: Denny Roberts ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), who had [[dwarfism]], and Rachel Burns ([[Francesca Martinez]]), who had [[cerebral palsy]]. Both characters were presented as \"one of the gang\" and hated being accorded any special treatment because of their circumstances. This prompted the BFI's 2002 publication ''The Hill And Beyond'' to comment that ''Grange Hill'' had perhaps become politically correct.<ref>Alistair D. McGown and Mark J. Docherty ''The Hill And Beyond'', 2002, p.115</ref>\n\nBeginning on 4 April 1993, in celebration of the programme's 15th anniversary, the first fifteen series of ''Grange Hill'' were repeated during Children's BBC's Sunday (and later, Saturday) morning slots on BBC1 and BBC2. The repeats ended with Series 16 in 1999. In the 1990s ''Grange Hill'' was repeated in full on digital satellite and cable channel [[UK Gold]], which broadcast the late 1970s and early 80s episodes of the show. In 1998, it reappeared on sister channel [[UK Gold Classics]], which was a digital-only channel showing programmes previously aired on UK Gold, and ''Grange Hill'' was part of its schedule. The channel lasted only six months, however, before becoming UK Gold 2 in April 1999. Interest in ''Grange Hill'' was renewed in the late 1990s and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary with the introduction of sinister Scottish bully Sean Pearce ([[Iain Robertson]]), who carried a knife and slashed the face of a classmate. Cast member [[Laura Sadler]], who was heavily involved in this storyline, died after falling out of a building in June 2003; four years earlier her ''Grange Hill'' character Judi Jeffreys had been killed after slipping and falling out of the window of a burning storeroom in the school.\n\nBy 2001, the series was almost entirely issue-led and the decision to tackle the subject of [[rape]] upset some parents. But when Phil Redmond took over production of ''Grange Hill'' in 2003, his plan was to get the show back to its roots and the issues were toned down as Redmond skewed the show towards a younger audience. In early 2006, it was announced that a film of ''Grange Hill'' was to be released in late 2007 focusing on the lives of former pupils;<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/news/883/ 'Grange Hill: The Movie' \u2013 News \u2013 Film \u2013 Time Out London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608223550/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/883/ |date=8 June 2008 }}</ref> although the film did not come to fruition.\n\n''Grange Hill'' returned on 14 April 2008 with its final series, including a return of the original theme music. Series 31 returned to BBC1 after the 2007 series was shown exclusively on the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC Channel]].<ref name=\"BBC060208\"/>\n\n== Production history ==\nFor its first 25 years Grange Hill was produced in-house by the [[BBC]], then the show was made independently for the corporation by [[Mersey Television|Mersey TV]], the production house founded by Redmond (and later renamed as Lime Pictures), hence the reason for the production move.\n\n=== Television Centre years: 1978\u20131985 ===\nLocation external and some interior scenes in ''Grange Hill'' were originally filmed at real schools in London. The first of these would be [[Kingsbury High School]] in [[North London|North West London]], which was used as the ''Grange Hill'' setting for the first two series. For series 3 (1980) exterior filming moved to Willesden High School (now [[Capital City Academy]]) in [[Willesden Green]], which was similar in looks to Kingsbury and was also situated in a residential area of the capital. In 1981, ''Grange Hill'' moved to [[Holborn College]] (now [[Fulham Preparatory School]]) in Greyhound Road, Hammersmith. This school looked very different from the two that had been used previously, and it was also in a built-up area of London. Holborn College was the longest serving of the \"real schools\", remaining on screen until 1985. Up to and including 1985, interior scenes were shot at the [[BBC Television Centre]] in London.\n\n=== Elstree years: 1985\u20132002 ===\nIn 1985, production shifted to the former ATV studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The BBC had purchased the studio complex the previous year.<ref>[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1984.htm \"Chronomedia: 1984\"], terramedia.co.uk</ref> The studios, now known as [[BBC Elstree Centre]], were the location for some exterior filming from Series 8 on the closed Elstree set. A 1960s office block, [[Neptune House]] in the facility now doubled as ''Hill''{{'}}s \"lower school\".\n\nThe change was explained on screen with an elaborate storyline whereby Grange Hill merged with rival schools Brookdale and Rodney Bennett to form a new school, Grange Hill. In Series 8 the merger had taken place and Grange Hill operated as a split-site school; the former Rodney Bennett building (Neptune House) being the lower school and the original Grange Hill building (still Holborn College) the upper school.\n\nIn series 9, the Upper School building was condemned after a fire, allowing production of ''Grange Hill'' to fully move to Elstree including studio work. ''Grange Hill'' was, at this time, made as an [[outside broadcast]] in the same way as its stablemate, ''[[EastEnders]]''. New producer Diana Kyle switched filming to a single camera format from 1999 onwards.\n\nA new school entrance set was unveiled in 1990 and remained in use until 2002, with cosmetic modifications along the way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/closeup/timeline.php |title=GRANGE HILL ONLINE &#124; Timeline Of Past Changes |publisher=Grangehillfans.co.uk |date=8 February 1978 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220174253/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/closeup/timeline.php |archivedate=20 February 2009 }}</ref> However, as the 1990s progressed more use was made of real schools including the Nicholas Hawksmoor School and [[Bushey Meads School]], and St Audrey's School in Hatfield.\n\n=== Liverpool years: 2003\u20132008 ===\nEarly in 2002 it was announced that ''Grange Hill'' creator Phil Redmond had signed a deal for his production company [[Mersey Television|Mersey TV]] to produce the next three series of the programme. Production moved to Mersey TV's studios in [[Childwall]], [[Liverpool]] from Series 26 onwards and for the first time in some years the appearance of Grange Hill School itself would change radically. On screen an explosion ripped through the school at the end of Series 25; during Series 26 tarpaulins covered most of the new \"school\" to mask the \"fire damage\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_1841000/1841591.stm|work=CBBC Newsround|title=Grange Hill moving to Liverpool|date=26 February 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386029/Schools-out-for-the-gang-as-Grange-Hill-heads-north.html|work=The Guardian|last=Leonard|first=Tom|title=School's out for the gang as Grange Hill heads north|date=26 February 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nPhil Redmond originally wanted children from all over the country to participate in the relaunched ''Grange Hill'', having a variety of regional accents in the series as opposed to just the London area voices which had become associated with the programme, however almost all new characters were exclusively cast from the north-west of England due to the logistics of the child employment laws.\n\nReal schools in the locality were also used including [[Croxteth]] Comprehensive, Holly Lodge Girls' School and [[St Hilda]]'s C of E High School in Liverpool.<ref>[http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/faq/faq_show.php GRANGE HILL ONLINE | Frequently Asked Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731124306/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/faq/faq_show.php |date=31 July 2009 }}</ref> In 2005, the former [[Brookside]] Parade set at Mersey TV was redeveloped to benefit ''Grange Hill'' and the new \"Creative Learning Centre\" subsequently became an integral part of the show. After ''Grange Hill'' ended in 2008, the CLC exterior set has now been turned into a skateboard park set for ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' while the former Grange Hill school frontage has become a permanent exterior for Hollyoaks High.\n\n==== \"The Grange\" ====\nIn 2007 [[Children's BBC|BBC Children's]] ordered major changes to ''Grange Hill'' so that it fitted in with the new requirement that all programmes under the CBBC banner must appeal to an audience age 12 and under \u2013 younger than the traditional age group for ''Grange Hill'', which was the same as to slightly younger than the secondary school characters. Under a deal signed in 2005, Lime Pictures was contracted to produce ''Grange Hill'' until 2008, so changes began to be made.\n\nFor series 31, Lime Pictures creative director Tony Wood set about the task of meeting CBBC's new requirements. He shifted much of the action away from general school life to \"The Grange\", the school's multimedia learning centre, which was given a radical makeover and became as much a \"hang out\" as a learning resource. The emphasis was now on younger characters with a group of Year 6 pupils regularly coming to use The Grange from primary school; storylines were much lighter and fantasy sequences were introduced. One episode, \"Boarderman\", saw a Year 7 pupil become a masked skateboarding superhero campaigning for an end to the school's ban on skateboarding. In another, \"Veggin' out\", a girl and her classmates smuggled animals from a local petting farm into school, believing they were destined for slaughter.\n\n''[[The Observer]]'' reported on 13 January 2008 that the BBC's intention was to shift the action away from Grange Hill School and into The Grange completely.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/13/television.bbc|title=Shut down Grange Hill, says its creator|work=[[The Observer]]|date=13 January 2008|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Phil Redmond responded in the same article by calling for ''Grange Hill'' to be scrapped, saying the programme had been \"robbed of its original purpose\". Redmond had been planning a hard-hitting storyline to return ''Grange Hill'' to its gritty origins in series 31, and although he signed off the changes he believed it wasn't his show any more.\n\n==== Cancellation ====\nOn 6 February 2008, the BBC announced ''Grange Hill'' was to be axed after exactly 30 years. The announcement was made by [[CBBC]] controller Anne Gilchrist just two days before the show's official 30th birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7230566.stm|work=BBC News|title=BBC to shut gates on Grange Hill|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> ''Grange Hill'' ended on Monday 15 September 2008.\n\nIn 2006, the BBC had announced big plans for the show's 30th birthday including special programming on BBC2, possible repeats and a lavish reunion of former stars during 2008.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/10/schools.broadcasting BBC plans 30th birthday party for Grange Hill: Media Guardian, 10 February 2006]</ref> But in the event, none of these celebrations happened aside from a special [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''Grange Hill: Soap Pioneer'' broadcast on 4 September 2008. The last ''Grange Hill'' was watched by 500,000 viewers.\n\nSeven months later, ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' paid homage to the series in its episode 2.1 (airing 20 April 2009). In that episode, the time-travelling protagonist, DI [[Alex Drake (Ashes to Ashes)|Alex Drake]], sees her daughter [[List of Ashes to Ashes characters#Molly Drake|Molly]] incorporated into an episode of ''Grange Hill'' on the evening of 3 or 5 April 1982 [calendar indicates 3 April; the news report was from 5 April]. Molly (in new footage) tells headmistress Bridget McClusky (appearing as archival footage and [[Gwyneth Powell]]'s newly recorded audio) that she and Tucker got into a fight when Tucker said her mother Alex was dead.\n\n== Spin-offs and merchandise ==\nThe show spawned a spin-off called ''[[Tucker's Luck]]'' (1983\u20131985), which ran for three series starring [[Todd Carty]]. The three series saw the two lead characters (Tucker and Alan) finding work. The 1986 cast released ''Grange Hill: The Album'', with two singles: \"[[Just Say No]]\" (tying in with a character's heroin addiction) and \"You Know the Teacher (Smash Head)\". The album was re-released on CD on 12 November 2007, as part of the BBC's 30th Anniversary celebrations.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1988, a documentary titled ''Behind The Scenes...At Grange Hill'' aired, presented by [[Lee MacDonald]]. The documentary featured: auditions, rehearsals and filming for [[Grange Hill (series 11)|series 11]], the child actors opinions on being tutored and chaperoned and what impact being in ''Grange Hill'' had on their schooling, as well as dealing with fame.\n\nIn 1989, a musical play titled ''Tucker's Return'' based on the series was staged at [[Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ghfun.co.uk/Hornchurch.htm |title=Tucker's Return |publisher=Geoff's Grange Hill Fan Page |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> Starring Todd Carty who, as Tucker, now returned to Grange Hill as a PE teacher, it also featured several stars of the show both from Tucker's original run, and of the then-current series circa 1989.\n\nIn 2005, [[Justin Lee Collins]] reunited some of the cast members from the 1980s in the documentary ''[[Bring Back...Grange Hill]]''.\n\n== Title sequence and theme music ==\nFrom the start of the series to 1989, the title sequence was in a comic book style and used \"[[Chicken Man (theme tune)|Chicken Man]]\" by [[Alan Hawkshaw]] as the theme tune.<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8QXjdYSrfs</ref> ''Grange Hill'' was the first programme to use it as a theme followed by the popular quiz show ''[[Give Us a Clue]]'', whose makers used it from 1979 to 1982, despite it already being played on ''Grange Hill''. ''Give Us a Clue'' used a less dynamic custom arrangement more in keeping with the style of light entertainment programming.\n\nIn 1988 for the 10th Anniversary the titles had changed, this time they were fully animated. An updated recording of Chicken Man was also used between 1988 and 1989.\n\nIn 1990 a new title sequence was introduced which showed pupils and staff travelling into school in a slightly grainy CCTV style.<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBz-u7TCbwE</ref> This was accompanied by a new, more contemporary-sounding theme written for the series by Peter Moss. Moss had previously written some special hip-hop music for a storyline in Series 11 of ''Grange Hill''.\n\nIn 1994 new titles were introduced showing pupils taking part various school subjects such as music, chemistry, PE and Food Technology,<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjA2CqGC-PY</ref> and the end theme was re-edited and re-recorded to reduce its length to just 35 seconds, the first edit in 4 years of the theme. This removed some of the various background elements and sharpened the end notes considerably. However, during this period in particular (1995\u20132000) several versions were used, with a variety of slightly longer edits creating different lead outs depending on the mood and theme of the episode.\n\nIn 2001 A more colourful sequence was introduced, this was due to Grange Hill being broadcast in widescreen for the first time, the opening theme had been cut slightly shorter for the first time since 1990.\n\nIn 2003 the titles once again changed, this was to reflect on the move to Liverpool as the previous titles featured shots of the old school building (Based In Elstree), once again the titles & the theme tune had been shortened down.\n\nIn 2004 the titles changed once again, these where in the style of a video game, The Moss theme tune had been edited down to around 12 seconds by this point. this was the first time since 1989 that live action footage was not used\n\nFor the 30th anniversary, and what turned out to be the final series, an abbreviated edit of the original version of \"Chicken Man\" was reinstated as the main theme, And for the final time, the titles had changed once again.\n\nThe last four notes of the original theme song were heard when ''[[Brookside]]'', one of Phil Redmond's other TV series, aired its final episode in November 2003.\n\n== Head teachers ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Mr Llewellyn did not appear on screen during the 1980 series: the day-to-day running of the school was left to the highly competent but much put-upon deputy head Mr Keating ([[Robert Hartley]]), who was also deputy head under Mrs McClusky until 1984. Similarly, Mr McNab was never seen at all during the mid-1990s; the most senior authority figure being Mr Robson who at this point was deputy head. Mr Robson himself did not appear on screen during Series 27, even though he was still headmaster for the early part of the series. Mrs McClusky, perhaps Grange Hill's best known head teacher, was demoted to deputy head temporarily in 1985 having had to reapply, unsuccessfully, for her post following the merger of Grange Hill with Brookdale and Rodney Bennett. When the new head, Mr Humphries, was killed in a road accident the following year, Mrs McClusky was again acting head and her permanent headship was later confirmed.\n\nThe final headmistress of Grange Hill was Miss Gayle, introduced as deputy head in the 2007 series although she did not appear in Series 31.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Grange Hill characters}}\n\n== Books ==\nDuring the 1980s, when ''Grange Hill'' merchandising was at its height and the series arguably at its most popular, a number of annuals and novels were published.\n\nEight annuals were published from 1981 to 1988.<ref>[http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/history/collectors3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220203327/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/history/collectors3.html |date=20 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nComic strip adventures appeared in the short-lived ''[[BEEB]]'' magazine, which portrayed new stories, and the longer running ''[[Fast Forward (magazine)|Fast Forward]]'' magazine which loosely followed the early 90s series. Additional comic strips occurred in ''[[School Fun]]'' and in the ''[[Radio Times]]''. ''Grange Hill'' had its own dedicated magazine, but this only lasted two issues and a holiday special.\n\nThere were 14 short story books and novels, some of which were written or co-written by series creator [[Phil Redmond]], but which also involved authors such as [[Robert Leeson]] and [[Jan Needle]]. Below is a full list of Grange Hill short story books and novels:\n\n# ''Grange Hill Stories'', by Phil Redmond. First published by the [[BBC]] in 1979.

However the game was ultimately never released, reportedly because it used multiple names and characters from the actual television series, which would have proved tricky and costly to clear the individual [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for each one. (The later 1987 game secured three character names and images but nothing else from the series to keep royalties costs down.)\n\n== Video and home media ==\nThe first and second series were originally released on the new technology of home video in the early 1980s. Both videos were edited to remove some storylines and thereby shorten running times, given the duration of early videocassettes. The front of the box for the series 1 video features a cast photograph (and small photos of specific individual characters) from series 3, as some characters pictured therein do not feature in that series. The series 2 videocassette box art features a similarly styled front cover, but with a cast photo from the correct year.\n\nThese abridged versions of the first two series of the show were also released on [[Betamax]], [[Video 2000]] & [[laserdisc]] around the same time.\n\n== DVD releases ==\nTo commemorate the 30th Anniversary of ''Grange Hill'', [[2 Entertain]] released two DVD box sets covering the first four series which were released on 12 November 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032833/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-BBC-Box/dp/B000V7GCRM|title=Grange Hill : Complete BBC Series 1 & 2 Box Set|publisher=amazon.co.uk |accessdate= 8 September 2019|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032833/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-BBC-Box/dp/B000V7GCRM|archivedate=24 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032849/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B000V9I9ZI|title=Grange Hill : Complete BBC Series 3 & 4 Box Set|publisher=amazon.co.uk |accessdate=8 September 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032849/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B000V9I9ZI|archivedate=24 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThey were both rated PG by the [[BBFC|British Board of film classification]].

In 1976, he managed to sell the idea to the [[BBC]], and the children's drama executive [[Anna Home]] commissioned an initial series of nine episodes in a trial run, the first being broadcast on 8 February 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/grangehill.htm |title=GRANGE HILL \u2013 A TELEVISION HEAVEN REVIEW |publisher=[[TV Heaven]] |accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Lysons|first=Jon|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/461091/ |title=Grange Hill (1978\u20132008) |publisher=BFI Screen Online |accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start, the series caused controversy for its real-life, gritty portrayal of [[school story|school life]], which differed from the idealised portrayals of earlier school [[drama]]s. Redmond has said that he wasn't really able to start pushing the boundaries until later series.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This led to Redmond being summoned to lunch by BBC bosses and forced to agree that there would be no further series unless he toned things down. ''Grange Hill'''s highest-profile period was undoubtedly the mid- to late 1980s. One of the most famous storylines during this time was that of [[Zammo McGuire]], played by [[Lee MacDonald]], and his addiction to [[heroin]]. This storyline ran over two series (1986\u201387) and focused on Zammo's descent into drugs and how it strained his relationship with girlfriend Jackie and friend Kevin. The show's other favourite characters during this period were Gonch and Hollo, played by John Holmes and Bradley Sheppard. During his time at the school (1985\u201389) Gonch took part in many moneymaking schemes, most of which were unsuccessful. There was a comedic element to the duo's relationship that worked well with viewers. Script editor [[Anthony Minghella]], who worked on the series for several years during the 1980s, later won an [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for the film ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' in 1996.\n\nDuring the 1990s, ''Grange Hill'' did not receive the same media attention that it had had just a few years before. The teachers were now equals in the narrative, with their personal lives taking up almost as much time as those of the pupils. In 1994, two characters were introduced with [[disability|disabilities]]: Denny Roberts ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), who had [[dwarfism]], and Rachel Burns ([[Francesca Martinez]]), who had [[cerebral palsy]]. Both characters were presented as \"one of the gang\" and hated being accorded any special treatment because of their circumstances. This prompted the BFI's 2002 publication ''The Hill And Beyond'' to comment that ''Grange Hill'' had perhaps become politically correct.<ref>Alistair D. McGown and Mark J. Docherty ''The Hill And Beyond'', 2002, p.115</ref>\n\nBeginning on 4 April 1993, in celebration of the programme's 15th anniversary, the first fifteen series of ''Grange Hill'' were repeated during Children's BBC's Sunday (and later, Saturday) morning slots on BBC1 and BBC2. The repeats ended with Series 16 in 1999. In the 1990s ''Grange Hill'' was repeated in full on digital satellite and cable channel [[UK Gold]], which broadcast the late 1970s and early 80s episodes of the show. In 1998, it reappeared on sister channel [[UK Gold Classics]], which was a digital-only channel showing programmes previously aired on UK Gold, and ''Grange Hill'' was part of its schedule. The channel lasted only six months, however, before becoming UK Gold 2 in April 1999. Interest in ''Grange Hill'' was renewed in the late 1990s and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary with the introduction of sinister Scottish bully Sean Pearce ([[Iain Robertson]]), who carried a knife and slashed the face of a classmate. Cast member [[Laura Sadler]], who was heavily involved in this storyline, died after falling out of a building in June 2003; four years earlier her ''Grange Hill'' character Judi Jeffreys had been killed after slipping and falling out of the window of a burning storeroom in the school.\n\nBy 2001, the series was almost entirely issue-led and the decision to tackle the subject of [[rape]] upset some parents. But when Phil Redmond took over production of ''Grange Hill'' in 2003, his plan was to get the show back to its roots and the issues were toned down as Redmond skewed the show towards a younger audience. In early 2006, it was announced that a film of ''Grange Hill'' was to be released in late 2007 focusing on the lives of former pupils;<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/news/883/ 'Grange Hill: The Movie' \u2013 News \u2013 Film \u2013 Time Out London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608223550/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/883/ |date=8 June 2008 }}</ref> although the film did not come to fruition.\n\n''Grange Hill'' returned on 14 April 2008 with its final series, including a return of the original theme music. Series 31 returned to BBC1 after the 2007 series was shown exclusively on the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC Channel]].<ref name=\"BBC060208\"/>\n\n== Production history ==\nFor its first 25 years Grange Hill was produced in-house by the [[BBC]], then the show was made independently for the corporation by [[Mersey Television|Mersey TV]], the production house founded by Redmond (and later renamed as Lime Pictures), hence the reason for the production move. \n\n=== Television Centre years: 1978\u20131985 ===\nLocation external and some interior scenes in ''Grange Hill'' were originally filmed at real schools in London. The first of these would be [[Kingsbury High School]] in [[North London|North West London]], which was used as the ''Grange Hill'' setting for the first two series. For series 3 (1980) exterior filming moved to Willesden High School (now [[Capital City Academy]]) in [[Willesden Green]], which was similar in looks to Kingsbury and was also situated in a residential area of the capital. In 1981, ''Grange Hill'' moved to [[Holborn College]] (now [[Fulham Preparatory School]]) in Greyhound Road, Hammersmith. This school looked very different from the two that had been used previously, and it was also in a built-up area of London. Holborn College was the longest serving of the \"real schools\", remaining on screen until 1985. Up to and including 1985, interior scenes were shot at the [[BBC Television Centre]] in London.\n\n=== Elstree years: 1985\u20132002 ===\nIn 1985, production shifted to the former ATV studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The BBC had purchased the studio complex the previous year.<ref>[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1984.htm \"Chronomedia: 1984\"], terramedia.co.uk</ref> The studios, now known as [[BBC Elstree Centre]], were the location for some exterior filming from Series 8 on the closed Elstree set. A 1960s office block, [[Neptune House]] in the facility now doubled as ''Hill''{{'}}s \"lower school\".\n\nThe change was explained on screen with an elaborate storyline whereby Grange Hill merged with rival schools Brookdale and Rodney Bennett to form a new school, Grange Hill. In Series 8 the merger had taken place and Grange Hill operated as a split-site school; the former Rodney Bennett building (Neptune House) being the lower school and the original Grange Hill building (still Holborn College) the upper school.\n\nIn series 9, the Upper School building was condemned after a fire, allowing production of ''Grange Hill'' to fully move to Elstree including studio work. ''Grange Hill'' was, at this time, made as an [[outside broadcast]] in the same way as its stablemate, ''[[EastEnders]]''. New producer Diana Kyle switched filming to a single camera format from 1999 onwards.\n\nA new school entrance set was unveiled in 1990 and remained in use until 2002, with cosmetic modifications along the way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/closeup/timeline.php |title=GRANGE HILL ONLINE &#124; Timeline Of Past Changes |publisher=Grangehillfans.co.uk |date=8 February 1978 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220174253/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/closeup/timeline.php |archivedate=20 February 2009 }}</ref> However, as the 1990s progressed more use was made of real schools including the Nicholas Hawksmoor School and [[Bushey Meads School]], and St Audrey's School in Hatfield.\n\n=== Liverpool years: 2003\u20132008 ===\nEarly in 2002 it was announced that ''Grange Hill'' creator Phil Redmond had signed a deal for his production company [[Mersey Television|Mersey TV]] to produce the next three series of the programme. Production moved to Mersey TV's studios in [[Childwall]], [[Liverpool]] from Series 26 onwards and for the first time in some years the appearance of Grange Hill School itself would change radically. On screen an explosion ripped through the school at the end of Series 25; during Series 26 tarpaulins covered most of the new \"school\" to mask the \"fire damage\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_1841000/1841591.stm|work=CBBC Newsround|title=Grange Hill moving to Liverpool|date=26 February 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386029/Schools-out-for-the-gang-as-Grange-Hill-heads-north.html|work=The Guardian|last=Leonard|first=Tom|title=School's out for the gang as Grange Hill heads north|date=26 February 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nPhil Redmond originally wanted children from all over the country to participate in the relaunched ''Grange Hill'', having a variety of regional accents in the series as opposed to just the London area voices which had become associated with the programme, however almost all new characters were exclusively cast from the north-west of England due to the logistics of the child employment laws.\n\nReal schools in the locality were also used including [[Croxteth]] Comprehensive, Holly Lodge Girls' School and [[St Hilda]]'s C of E High School in Liverpool.<ref>[http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/faq/faq_show.php GRANGE HILL ONLINE | Frequently Asked Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731124306/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/faq/faq_show.php |date=31 July 2009 }}</ref> In 2005, the former [[Brookside]] Parade set at Mersey TV was redeveloped to benefit ''Grange Hill'' and the new \"Creative Learning Centre\" subsequently became an integral part of the show. After ''Grange Hill'' ended in 2008, the CLC exterior set has now been turned into a skateboard park set for ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' while the former Grange Hill school frontage has become a permanent exterior for Hollyoaks High.\n\n==== \"The Grange\" ====\nIn 2007 [[Children's BBC|BBC Children's]] ordered major changes to ''Grange Hill'' so that it fitted in with the new requirement that all programmes under the CBBC banner must appeal to an audience age 12 and under \u2013 younger than the traditional age group for ''Grange Hill'', which was the same as to slightly younger than the secondary school characters. Under a deal signed in 2005, Lime Pictures was contracted to produce ''Grange Hill'' until 2008, so changes began to be made.\n\nFor series 31, Lime Pictures creative director Tony Wood set about the task of meeting CBBC's new requirements. He shifted much of the action away from general school life to \"The Grange\", the school's multimedia learning centre, which was given a radical makeover and became as much a \"hang out\" as a learning resource. The emphasis was now on younger characters with a group of Year 6 pupils regularly coming to use The Grange from primary school; storylines were much lighter and fantasy sequences were introduced. One episode, \"Boarderman\", saw a Year 7 pupil become a masked skateboarding superhero campaigning for an end to the school's ban on skateboarding. In another, \"Veggin' out\", a girl and her classmates smuggled animals from a local petting farm into school, believing they were destined for slaughter.\n\n''[[The Observer]]'' reported on 13 January 2008 that the BBC's intention was to shift the action away from Grange Hill School and into The Grange completely.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/13/television.bbc|title=Shut down Grange Hill, says its creator|work=[[The Observer]]|date=13 January 2008|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Phil Redmond responded in the same article by calling for ''Grange Hill'' to be scrapped, saying the programme had been \"robbed of its original purpose\". Redmond had been planning a hard-hitting storyline to return ''Grange Hill'' to its gritty origins in series 31, and although he signed off the changes he believed it wasn't his show any more.\n\n==== Cancellation ====\nOn 6 February 2008, the BBC announced ''Grange Hill'' was to be axed after exactly 30 years. The announcement was made by [[CBBC]] controller Anne Gilchrist just two days before the show's official 30th birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7230566.stm|work=BBC News|title=BBC to shut gates on Grange Hill|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> ''Grange Hill'' ended on Monday 15 September 2008.\n\nIn 2006, the BBC had announced big plans for the show's 30th birthday including special programming on BBC2, possible repeats and a lavish reunion of former stars during 2008.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/10/schools.broadcasting BBC plans 30th birthday party for Grange Hill: Media Guardian, 10 February 2006]</ref> But in the event, none of these celebrations happened aside from a special [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''Grange Hill: Soap Pioneer'' broadcast on 4 September 2008. The last ''Grange Hill'' was watched by 500,000 viewers.\n\nSeven months later, ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' paid homage to the series in its episode 2.1 (airing 20 April 2009). In that episode, the time-travelling protagonist, DI [[Alex Drake (Ashes to Ashes)|Alex Drake]], sees her daughter [[List of Ashes to Ashes characters#Molly Drake|Molly]] incorporated into an episode of ''Grange Hill'' on the evening of 3 or 5 April 1982 [calendar indicates 3 April; the news report was from 5 April]. Molly (in new footage) tells headmistress Bridget McClusky (appearing as archival footage and [[Gwyneth Powell]]'s newly recorded audio) that she and Tucker got into a fight when Tucker said her mother Alex was dead.\n\n== Spin-offs and merchandise ==\nThe show spawned a spin-off called ''[[Tucker's Luck]]'' (1983\u20131985), which ran for three series starring [[Todd Carty]]. The three series saw the two lead characters (Tucker and Alan) finding work. The 1986 cast released ''Grange Hill: The Album'', with two singles: \"[[Just Say No]]\" (tying in with a character's heroin addiction) and \"You Know the Teacher (Smash Head)\". The album was re-released on CD on 12 November 2007, as part of the BBC's 30th Anniversary celebrations.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1988, a documentary titled ''Behind The Scenes...At Grange Hill'' aired, presented by [[Lee MacDonald]]. The documentary featured: auditions, rehearsals and filming for [[Grange Hill (series 11)|series 11]], the child actors opinions on being tutored and chaperoned and what impact being in ''Grange Hill'' had on their schooling, as well as dealing with fame.\n\nIn 1989, a musical play titled ''Tucker's Return'' based on the series was staged at [[Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ghfun.co.uk/Hornchurch.htm |title=Tucker's Return |publisher=Geoff's Grange Hill Fan Page |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> Starring Todd Carty who, as Tucker, now returned to Grange Hill as a PE teacher, it also featured several stars of the show both from Tucker's original run, and of the then-current series circa 1989.\n\nIn 2005, [[Justin Lee Collins]] reunited some of the cast members from the 1980s in the documentary ''[[Bring Back...Grange Hill]]''.\n\n== Title sequence and theme music ==\nFrom the start of the series to 1989, the title sequence was in a comic book style and used \"[[Chicken Man (theme tune)|Chicken Man]]\" by [[Alan Hawkshaw]] as the theme tune.<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8QXjdYSrfs</ref> ''Grange Hill'' was the first programme to use it as a theme followed by the popular quiz show ''[[Give Us a Clue]]'', whose makers used it from 1979 to 1982, despite it already being played on ''Grange Hill''. ''Give Us a Clue'' used a less dynamic custom arrangement more in keeping with the style of light entertainment programming. \n\nIn 1988 for the 10th Anniversary the titles had changed, this time they where fully animated. An updated recording of Chicken Man was also used between 1988 to 1989.\n\nIn 1990 a new title sequence was introduced which showed pupils and staff travelling into school in a slightly grainy CCTV style.<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBz-u7TCbwE</ref> This was accompanied by a new, more contemporary-sounding theme written for the series by Peter Moss. Moss had previously written some special hip-hop music for a storyline in Series 11 of ''Grange Hill''.\n\nIn 1994 new titles were introduced showing pupils taking part various school subjects such as music, chemistry, PE and Food Technology<ref>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjA2CqGC-PY</ref>, and the end theme was re-edited and re-recorded to reduce its length to just 35 seconds, the first edit in 4 years of the theme. This removed some of the various background elements and sharpened the end notes considerably. However, during this period in particular (1995\u20132000) several versions were used, with a variety of slightly longer edits creating different lead outs depending on the mood and theme of the episode. \n\nIn 2001 A more colourful sequence was introduced, this was due to Grange Hill being broadcast in widescreen for the first time, the opening theme had been cut slightly shorter for the first time since 1990. \n\nIn 2003 the titles once again changed, this was to reflect on the move to Liverpool as the previous titles featured shots of the old school building (Based In Elstree), once again the titles & the theme tune had been shortened down. \n\nIn 2004 the titles changed once again, these where in the style of a video game, The Moss theme tune had been edited down to around 12 seconds by this point. this was the first time since 1989 that live action footage was not used  \n\nFor the 30th anniversary, and what turned out to be the final series, an abbreviated edit of the original version of \"Chicken Man\" was reinstated as the main theme, And for the final time, the titles had changed once again.\n\nThe last four notes of the original theme song were heard when ''[[Brookside]]'', one of Phil Redmond's other TV series, aired its final episode in November 2003.\n\n== Head teachers ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Mr Llewellyn did not appear on screen during the 1980 series: the day-to-day running of the school was left to the highly competent but much put-upon deputy head Mr Keating ([[Robert Hartley]]), who was also deputy head under Mrs McClusky until 1984. Similarly, Mr McNab was never seen at all during the mid-1990s; the most senior authority figure being Mr Robson who at this point was deputy head. Mr Robson himself did not appear on screen during Series 27, even though he was still headmaster for the early part of the series. Mrs McClusky, perhaps Grange Hill's best known head teacher, was demoted to deputy head temporarily in 1985 having had to reapply, unsuccessfully, for her post following the merger of Grange Hill with Brookdale and Rodney Bennett. When the new head, Mr Humphries, was killed in a road accident the following year, Mrs McClusky was again acting head and her permanent headship was later confirmed.\n\nThe final headmistress of Grange Hill was Miss Gayle, introduced as deputy head in the 2007 series although she did not appear in Series 31.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Grange Hill characters}}\n\n== Books ==\nDuring the 1980s, when ''Grange Hill'' merchandising was at its height and the series arguably at its most popular, a number of annuals and novels were published.\n\nEight annuals were published from 1981 to 1988.<ref>[http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/history/collectors3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220203327/http://www.grangehillfans.co.uk/history/collectors3.html |date=20 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nComic strip adventures appeared in the short-lived ''[[BEEB]]'' magazine, which portrayed new stories, and the longer running ''[[Fast Forward (magazine)|Fast Forward]]'' magazine which loosely followed the early 90s series. Additional comic strips occurred in ''[[School Fun]]'' and in the ''[[Radio Times]]''. ''Grange Hill'' had its own dedicated magazine, but this only lasted two issues and a holiday special.\n\nThere were 14 short story books and novels, some of which were written or co-written by series creator [[Phil Redmond]], but which also involved authors such as [[Robert Leeson]] and [[Jan Needle]]. Below is a full list of Grange Hill short story books and novels:\n\n# ''Grange Hill Stories'', by Phil Redmond. First published by the [[BBC]] in 1979.

An academic study of Grange Hill from Series 1 to the end of Series 16, including the 2 Christmas episodes + a brief study of the history of children's TV series and serials from 1960 to 1990. Contains photographs and full cast / crew credit.\n\n== Video game ==\n{{main|Grange Hill (video game)}}\nIn 1987 a [[video game]] was made for 8-bit computers including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].<ref>[http://www.xgd.com/id/44502 Grange Hill for the Commodore 64, XGD.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928075115/http://www.xgd.com/id/44502 |date=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA [[text adventure]] game based on the series was written in 1985 for the [[BBC Micro]] and several other systems, and was mentioned as 'upcoming' in several home computer magazines of the time, with the player (you) having to navigate through a tricky school day as the end of term approaches, solving a number of tricky situations and trying to \"get your grades\" after the family dog has literally eaten your entire year's homework. However the game was ultimately never released, reportedly because it used multiple names and characters from the actual television series, which would have proved tricky and costly to clear the individual [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for each one. (The later 1987 game secured three character names and images but nothing else from the series to keep royalties costs down.)\n\n== Video and home media ==\nThe first and second series were originally released on the new technology of home video in the early 1980s. Both videos were edited to remove some storylines and thereby shorten running times, given the duration of early videocassettes. The front of the box for the series 1 video features a cast photograph (and small photos of specific individual characters) from series 3, as some characters pictured therein do not feature in that series. The series 2 videocassette box art features a similarly styled front cover, but with a cast photo from the correct year.\n\nThese abridged versions of the first two series of the show were also released on [[Betamax]], [[Video 2000]] & [[laserdisc]] around the same time.\n\n== DVD releases ==\nTo commemorate the 30th Anniversary of ''Grange Hill'', [[2 Entertain]] released two DVD box sets covering the first four series which were released on 12 November 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032833/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-BBC-Box/dp/B000V7GCRM|title=Grange Hill : Complete BBC Series 1 & 2 Box Set|publisher=amazon.co.uk |accessdate= 8 September 2019|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032833/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-BBC-Box/dp/B000V7GCRM|archivedate=24 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032849/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B000V9I9ZI|title=Grange Hill : Complete BBC Series 3 & 4 Box Set|publisher=amazon.co.uk |accessdate=8 September 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032849/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grange-Hill-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B000V9I9ZI|archivedate=24 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThey were both rated PG by the [[BBFC|British Board of film classification]]. There are no subtitles, episodes are in [[4:3]] (the original format) and both box sets come with a booklet detailing each episode.

The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].\n\n[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\nOn Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nFrom the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:TelfordBeatties.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatties]] department store at the west end of [[Telford Shopping Centre]], which was renamed [[House of Fraser]] in early 2007.]]\n[[File:Telford Town Centre .jpg|thumb|Northfield Street Telford Centre]]\n[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]\nThe New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].\n\nThe Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.\n\nIn 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.\n\nMany of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.\n\nIn 2007, a \u00a3250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire \u2013 Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart.

Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].\n\nTelford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative).

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster.

The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]].

The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield.

Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council.

Susan is devastated when a patient, Nancy Greenly, who happens to be her best friend, is pronounced brain-dead and comatose there after an attempted abortion. Her suspicions are aroused when another young and otherwise healthy patient, Sean Murphy, also falls comatose during knee surgery for a recent sports injury. Susan finds that over the previous year an unusual number of other fit, young people have suffered the same fate. She discovers three similarities among the cases: they all took place in the same operating room, all patients were tissue-typed and all the comatose bodies were moved to a remote facility called the Jefferson Institute. She offends Chief of Anesthesiology, Dr. George &ndash; a powerful figure in the hospital whose wife is also an heiress &ndash; by asking to review the relevant case patient charts. Increasingly isolated and under mounting pressure from superiors and colleagues, she wonders whether she can even trust her own boyfriend, Dr. Mark Bellows. She also visits the morgue where a postmortem examination is being performed on Nancy, who had since died. The pathologists are puzzled, and this leads to speculation on how to commit the perfect murder, to which one of the pathologists suggests [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning. Susan is called into the office of Chief of Surgery, Dr. George Harris, owing to her trouble with Dr. George, and given a weekend off to recuperate from the loss of her friend. She and Mark travel to the seaside and spend a relaxing weekend together. Driving back to Boston they see a sign for the Jefferson Institute. Following an access road, a mysterious, imposing and unmarked concrete building reveals itself. Susan wants both of them to go inside, but Mark declines, allowing her to go alone while he waits in the car. After pressing the buzzer at the entrance, she is greeted by Nurse Emerson. Susan announces herself as Dr. Susan Wheeler, and asks if she can enter, but is informed that the facility is closed, but that the next tour for physicians is Tuesday morning. Returning to join the tour, Susan finds what is apparently an advanced, low-cost care facility for comatose patients. However, while investigating the large areas of the building that were left unvisited, she discovers that the institute is a front for black-market organ sales, where the patients' organs are sold to the highest bidder. Boston Memorial purposefully induces comas in select patients whose organs match those of potential buyers. The patients are rendered brain-dead via covert carbon monoxide poisoning through a line that leads from a tank in the basement to the OR, the valve for which is controlled by a radio signal. While she investigates the Jefferson Institute, Susan is caught on surveillance cameras. She manages to escape security atop the roof of an ambulance leaving to transport harvested organs to [[Logan Airport]]. Susan thinks that Dr. George is the mastermind of the scheme, and rushes to her supervisor, Dr. Harris, with whom she has been confiding, and explains what she has discovered. Dr. Harris offers her a drink which is drugged, and begins to incapacitate Susan while also causing severe abdominal pain that mimics [[appendicitis]]. As she begins losing consciousness, Dr. Harris rationalizes that physicians must take charge of certain issues themselves, as neither the government nor the general public is informed enough or inclined to do so. He phones in an emergency from his office, and offers to perform the surgery on Susan himself, in order to silence her by rendering her brain-dead under the pretext of an appendectomy. As they are preparing for surgery, Dr. Harris is informed that his preferred operating room is not available. His vehement insistence upon using room eight arouses the suspicions of Mark, who finds the gas tank and line to room eight \u2013 disconnecting it before the carbon monoxide can permanently injure Susan.

Susan is devastated when a patient, Nancy Greenly, who happens to be her best friend, is pronounced brain-dead and comatose there after an attempted abortion. Her suspicions are aroused when another young and otherwise healthy patient, Sean Murphy, also falls comatose during knee surgery for a recent sports injury. Susan finds that over the previous year an unusual number of other fit, young people have suffered the same fate. She discovers three similarities among the cases: they all took place in the same operating room, all patients were tissue-typed and all the comatose bodies were moved to a remote facility called the Jefferson Institute. She offends Chief of Anesthesiology, Dr. George &ndash; a powerful figure in the hospital whose wife is also an heiress &ndash; by asking to review the relevant case patient charts. Increasingly isolated and under mounting pressure from superiors and colleagues, she wonders whether she can even trust her own boyfriend, Dr. Mark Bellows. She also visits the morgue where a postmortem examination is being performed on Nancy, who had since died. The pathologists are puzzled, and this leads to speculation on how to commit the perfect murder, to which one of the pathologists suggests [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning. Susan is called into the office of Chief of Surgery, Dr. George Harris, owing to her trouble with Dr. George, and given a weekend off to recuperate from the loss of her friend. She and Mark travel to the seaside and spend a relaxing weekend together. Driving back to Boston they see a sign for the Jefferson Institute. Following an access road, a mysterious, imposing and unmarked concrete building reveals itself. Susan wants both of them to go inside, but Mark declines, allowing her to go alone while he waits in the car. After pressing the buzzer at the entrance, she is greeted by Nurse Emerson. Susan announces herself as Dr. Susan Wheeler, and asks if she can enter, but is informed that the facility is closed, but that the next tour for physicians is Tuesday morning. Returning to join the tour, Susan finds what is apparently an advanced, low-cost care facility for comatose patients. However, while investigating the large areas of the building that were left unvisited, she discovers that the institute is a front for black-market organ sales, where the patients' organs are sold to the highest bidder. Boston Memorial purposefully induces comas in select patients whose organs match those of potential buyers. The patients are rendered brain-dead via covert carbon monoxide poisoning through a line that leads from a tank in the basement to the OR, the valve for which is controlled by a radio signal. While she investigates the Jefferson Institute, Susan is caught on surveillance cameras. She manages to escape security atop the roof of an ambulance leaving to transport harvested organs to [[Logan Airport]]. Susan thinks that Dr. George is the mastermind of the scheme, and rushes to her supervisor, Dr. Harris, with whom she has been confiding, and explains what she has discovered. Dr. Harris offers her a drink which is drugged, and begins to incapacitate Susan while also causing severe abdominal pain that mimics [[appendicitis]]. As she begins losing consciousness, Dr. Harris rationalizes that physicians must take charge of certain issues themselves, as neither the government nor the general public is informed enough or inclined to do so. He phones in an emergency from his office, and offers to perform the surgery on Susan himself, in order to silence her by rendering her brain-dead under the pretext of an appendectomy. As they are preparing for surgery, Dr. Harris is informed that his preferred operating room is not available. His vehement insistence upon using room eight arouses the suspicions of Mark, who finds the gas tank and line to room eight \u2013 disconnecting it before the carbon monoxide can permanently injure Susan. Susan awakens after surgery, much to Dr. Harris' surprise, and is wheeled out of the operating room holding Mark's hand. A defeated Dr. Harris is left back in operating room eight, while two police officers wait outside to arrest him.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/02/archives/screen-coma-hospital-mysterysnooping-in-the-or.html |title=Screen: &#x27;Coma,&#x27; Hospital Mystery:Snooping in the O.R. - The New York Times |date=February 2, 1978 |first1=Vincent |last1=Canby |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Dr. Susan Wheeler, surgery resident at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Dr. Mark Bellows, surgery resident at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Elizabeth Ashley]] as Nurse Emerson of the Jefferson Institute\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Dr. George, chief of anesthesiology at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as Dr. George Harris, chief of surgery at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Nancy Greenly\n* [[Hari Rhodes]] as Dr. Morelind, hospital psychiatrist at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]] as Jim, a pathologist at Boston Memorial Hospital\n* [[Lance LeGault]] as Vince, the truck driver\n* [[Tom Selleck]] as surgery patient Sean Murphy\n* [[Joanna Kerns]] as Diane\n* [[Ed Harris]] as one of two pathology residents who tells Susan how a patient might be killed\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as a doctor<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Crichton]] was a friend of Cook.

In the nineteenth century, economic prosperity rather than martial service to the Muslims replaced the mobility into Maratha identity.

Widow remarriage was an accepted practice in many lower castes[Ranade,1991]...For the purpose of analysis, we have grouped these 56 castes into the following basic categories (1) Brahmin, Saraswat, and CKP (2) Maratha, and (3) other castes (page99) Table 8 reveals that women from the upper castes i.e. Brahmin, Saraswat, and CKP together form the largest group(46%) among the women admitted[in the Ashrams]...The data also reveals some significant differences in the marital status of Brahmin, CKP and Saraswat women on one hand and Maratha and other caste women on the other...These statistical differences acquire a special meaning when we look at them in the context of our earlier statement that oppression of widows and the restrictions on married women were far more severe for the women from Brahmin, CKP and Saraswat castes than for women from Maratha and other castes.}}</ref>\n\n====Dowry Issues====\nBeing a politically dominant caste, the Marathas have not been able to progress beyond the social practices of [[Dowry system in India|Dowry]] (Dowry refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.<ref>{{Cite book| title     = Dowry Deaths and Access to Justice in Kali's Yug: Empowerment, Law and Dowry Deaths| author= Jethmalani & P.K.

Data compiled by the Maratha Kranti Morcha members showed that the expenditure incurred by an average low income and poor Maratha family has doubled in the last 10 years when it comes to dowry. A member said (in 2018), \"The dowry amount ranges from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, depending on the profession of the groom. The lower-middle class Marathas too often have to bear an expenditure of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh for a daughter's wedding. Even in the remote villages, a small and marginal farmer spends Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh on a daughter's wedding.\" Some caste members tried to use the Morcha to address the issue of Dowry but they did not get a positive response. [[Dowry system in India|Dowry]] has now attained a status symbol in the community and that is part of the issue.<ref>{{cite news|date=9 September 2018|title=Dowry, child marriage issues plague Maratha and Dhangar communities|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/dowry-child-marriage-issues-plague-maratha-and-dhangar-communities-5346895/}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals and Gods===\n\nRosalind O'Hanlon, Professor at the [[University of Oxford]] stated that the Hindu God [[Mhasoba]] is traditionally very popular in the Maratha caste. {{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason= Is O'Hanlon talking about Marathi people in general, the Kunbi, or specifically about the Maratha caste?

In Maharashtra, for instance, the family norms among the Saraswats and CKPs were similar to those of the Brahmins. Marathas although politically powerful and economically well to do, were on the lower rung of the caste echelon. They had different ritual norms which were marginally lenient as compared to the Brahmins. In contrast, the women from the lower castes enjoyed a little more freedom in these matters. Widow remarriage was an accepted practice in many lower castes[Ranade,1991]...For the purpose of analysis, we have grouped these 56 castes into the following basic categories (1) Brahmin, Saraswat, and CKP (2) Maratha, and (3) other castes (page99) Table 8 reveals that women from the upper castes i.e. Brahmin, Saraswat, and CKP together form the largest group(46%) among the women admitted[in the Ashrams]...The data also reveals some significant differences in the marital status of Brahmin, CKP and Saraswat women on one hand and Maratha and other caste women on the other...These statistical differences acquire a special meaning when we look at them in the context of our earlier statement that oppression of widows and the restrictions on married women were far more severe for the women from Brahmin, CKP and Saraswat castes than for women from Maratha and other castes.}}</ref>\n\n====Dowry Issues====\nBeing a politically dominant caste, the Marathas have not been able to progress beyond the social practices of [[Dowry system in India|Dowry]] (Dowry refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.<ref>{{Cite book| title     = Dowry Deaths and Access to Justice in Kali's Yug: Empowerment, Law and Dowry Deaths| author= Jethmalani & P.K.

Data compiled by the Maratha Kranti Morcha members showed that the expenditure incurred by an average low income and poor Maratha family has doubled in the last 10 years when it comes to dowry. A member said (in 2018), \"The dowry amount ranges from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, depending on the profession of the groom. The lower-middle class Marathas too often have to bear an expenditure of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh for a daughter's wedding. Even in the remote villages, a small and marginal farmer spends Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh on a daughter's wedding.\" Some caste members tried to use the Morcha to address the issue of Dowry but they did not get a positive response.

These cars are often called \"Cobras\", which was the [[AC Cobra|Ford-powered AC-based two-seat sports car]] also produced by [[Shelby American]] during the same period. Both models use the Cobra emblem, similar paint scheme, and the optional \"Cobra\" valve covers on many GT350s that were part of a marketing tie-in by Shelby, as well as one of his iconic symbols.

Beginning as a stock Mustang with a 4-speed [[manual transmission]] and 9\" live [[rear axle]], the cars were shipped to Shelby American, where they received the high-riser manifolds, Tri-Y headers, and were given larger [[Ford Galaxie]] rear [[drum brake]]s with metallic-[[Brake lining|linings]] and Kelsey-Hayes front [[disc brake]]s.\n\nThe 1965 GT350 was not built for comfort or ease of driving. There were 34 \"GT350R\" race-spec cars built specifically for competition use under [[SCCA Pro Racing|SCCA]] rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cantwell|first=Chuck|title=SCCA Shelby Mustang GT350R|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=May 2014|volume=65|issue=8|page=70}}</ref> The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including rear seats, optional colors, and an optional [[automatic transmission]]. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, while losing much of their competitiveness in the process. The 1969 GT350s and GT500s were largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang. By 1969 [[Carroll Shelby]] was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford.\n\nThe 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] in [[body in white]] form for modification by Carroll Shelby's operation, originally in [[Venice Beach]] and later at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

Smith.\n\n====1965 GT350s====\nAll 1965 GT350s were painted Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Very few GT350s were delivered to the dealer with the optional \"[[Le Mans]]\" (or \"LeMans\") top stripes, which run the length of the entire car. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built had Le Mans stripes.

Over-rider traction bars are named so because of their design being on top of the leaf spring as opposed to underneath them. There was only one transmission available, a 4-speed [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] T10 manual. The [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust system]] in the 1965 GT350 was a side-exit dual exhaust with [[glasspack]] [[muffler]]s. For this one year, the GT350 also had special {{cvt|130|mph|abbr=on}}-rated [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] \"Blue Dot\" tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 GT350 had a full size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to be allowed to race under [[SCCA]] regulations as a \"sports car\"), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center \"Cragar Shelby\" 15\" rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized \"CS\".

Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], as well as an optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later cars had their engines painted the regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.\n\nThe first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks. These cars were specifically ordered by [[Shelby American]] for conversion into 1966 GT350s. Upon delivery to Shelby-American, the cars were randomly picked for conversion. The Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order with Ford VINs. The Ford VINs were shipped in 'blocks,' but many differ significantly because the order they were taken for conversions.\n\nTotal production for 1966 was 1,373 fastbacks, including two prototypes and four drag cars, and the 252 early production models with Ford Mustang 1965 bodies. In order to help Shelby sales, Ford, the major shareholder of [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]], persuaded the rental car giant to purchase 1,003 fastbacks, including two prototypes.

The design of the original 1965 version was evident, but these styling upgrades gave the car a more aggressive appearance and achieved Carroll Shelby's goal of differentiating his car from the Mustang on which it was based.\nThe separate high-beam headlamps in the grille added more character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic \"Shelby GT350\" logo in place (except for the very early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal sequential taillights (sourced from a '67 Cougar in 1967 and a '65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear quarter panels.\nTen-spoke, fifteen-inch, cast-aluminum rims were the wheel choice with [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] white-lettered radials.\n\nThe GT350 was available with air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a whopping 8,000-rpm tachometer were joined along with a smaller analog clock, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure gauges.\n\nThe 1967 GT350 came with an iron-block, 289-cubic-inch (4.7-liter) V-8 rated at 306 horsepower and 329&nbsp;lb-foot of torque. For a pushrod design, the GT350 revved relatively high, with the horsepower peak not in full swing until the 6,000-rpm redline. 1967 was well before modern fuel injection came about, and the car used a single [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel carburetor. The true dual-exhaust with H-shaped crossover system came standard with low restriction mufflers and chrome exhaust tips. Power was routed to the ground through a sturdy, four-speed manual transmission with a single, dry-disc clutch. A three-speed automatic was made available as an option. Rear-end ratios were 3.89-to-1 for the four-speed manual and 3.50-to-1 for the automatic. Acceleration was impressive, with a 0-to-60 time of around seven seconds and a top speed of {{convert|140|mph}}.\nBraking duties were handled by 11.3-inch discs up front and drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front suspension consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.\n\nIn 1968 the 289ci V8 was replaced with a factory 302 V8 using an aluminum Cobra intake manifold and [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 600 cfm carb. The 302 had less racing parts than the 289 and was rated at 250&nbsp;hp. A Paxton Supercharger was available that was rated at 33&nbsp;hp at 5,200&nbsp;rpm.\n{{clear}}\n\n====1967 Shelby GT500 and 1968 Cobra GT500====\n{{Infobox automobile\n| transmission=3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] <br/>4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| name=1967 Shelby GT500<br/>1968 Shelby Cobra GT500\n| body_style=2-door [[fastback]]<br/>2-door [[convertible]]\n| engine=[[Ford FE engine#428|{{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 428]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br/>[[Ford FE engine#428 Cobra Jet|{{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 428 Cobra Jet]] V8\n| assembly= '''1967:''' [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]<br/>'''1968:''' [[Ionia, Michigan]]\n| production=1967\u20131968\n| image=File:1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Fastback (15581357832).jpg\n| weight = {{convert|1470|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = '''1968 GT500KR<br/>''' [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|2008\u20132009 Ford Shelby GT500KR]]\n}}\n[[File:1968 Shelby GT500 conv right.jpg|thumb|left|1968 convertible]]\n[http://www.houseofamericancars.com/1967-shelby-gt500-super-snake-is-back-in-perfection-for-250000-bucks/ The 1967 Shelby G.T. 500] was the first model built in the Shelby G.T. 500 range.

Presented in concept form, the new GT350 had a supercharged version of the brand new 5.0-liter V8 engine in the 2011 Mustang GT as well as performance upgrades from [[Ford Racing]], Borla, Cragar, Baer and more.\n\nThe GT350 was a post-title upgrade available from Shelby. Customers could have their 2011 Mustangs shipped directly to Shelby's Las Vegas facility to be converted or they could deliver the car themselves. Automatic transmission was available for conversion with a naturally aspirated engine, producing up to {{cvt|430|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and manual transmission cars had the option of NA or a supercharged engine fitted with a [[Ford Racing]] supercharger to produce {{cvt|525|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, or at the expense of the warranty, {{cvt|624|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a [[Ford Racing]] suspension system (The first 100 cars were fitted with the Eibach suspension carried over from the GT500 Supersnake), Baer brakes in front and optional in rear, Custom Borla exhaust system, 19\" Cragar wheels, and more. For the exterior, Shelby installed a new front fascia, front splitter, functional hood scoop, functional brake cooling ducts, tail light trim, rear deck lid filler panel, and a rear fascia with center exhaust exit. Performance White with Guardsman Blue racing stripes were the only available color combination for 2011 models. 2012 models were available in other colors, but lost the 45th Anniversary badge of the 2011.\n\nInitial road tests of the GT350 by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' show the 2011 Shelby GT350 is capable of accelerating from 0&ndash;{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 3.7 seconds,<ref name=\"motortrend\">Lieberman, Jonny. \"First Test: 2011 Ford Shelby GT350 Prototype\".

These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible offered a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit upgrades included a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced was also included. The 2012 Shelby GT350 delivers the same performance numbers as the 2011 model. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take on a life of its own. An automatic transmission was optional with the naturally aspirated engine. Keeping the powerful engine under control was an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang a reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes were also included in the package.\n\n===2012 Shelby GTS===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = 2012 Shelby GTS\n| image =\n| caption = \n| manufacturer = \n| aka = \n| production = \n| model_years = 2012\n| engine = [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|3.7 L ''Cyclone'']] [[supercharged]] [[V6 engine|V6]]<br/>[[Ford Modular engine#5.0.C2.A0L Coyote|5.0 \"Coyote\"]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br/>2-door [[convertible]]\n| wheelbase = \n| length = \n| width = \n| height = \n| weight = \n| related = [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)]]\n| predecessor = [[Shelby Mustang#2007\u20132008 Ford Shelby GT|2007\u20132008 Ford Shelby GT]]\n| successor = 2013 Shelby GTS\n}}\nThe Shelby GTS was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show#2012|2012 New York Auto Show]], a new model designed to be attainable to the masses.

On the base GT, it got a front splitter conversion with a GT500 rear spoiler and quarter glass covers. The hood was made of fiberglass to save weight and the Le Mans stripes added some style. A separate wide body conversion with the option of rear-only or full all-around wide body wheel arches was also available to spice up the exterior of the 2014 Shelby GT. Among other accessories, Shelby GT front fascia, carbon laminated hood louvers, billet upper grille with Ford running pony emblem and \"Powered by Ford\" badges on the sides completed the exterior package.\n\nThe interior of the 2014 Shelby GT had been overhauled to keep up with the latest trends. Unique touches to the interior included an A-pillar gauge pod with boost, and fuel and oil pressure gauges. This modification was only available on the GT/SC conversion.\nEven the standard GT conversion got the Shelby headrest covers, special GT dash plaque and engine plate. Leather upholstery in black was standard along with electrically adjustable seats.\n\nThe \"Shelby GT Standard\" is the base pack with 430 horsepower. The slight bump in power was achieved by fitting a Borla performance exhaust as well as engine tuning. The standard package also included a Barton short shifter.\nThe \"Shelby GT/SC\" gives 100 more horsepower over the base modification. Shelby [[Ford Racing]] Whipple Supercharger kit in either 525&nbsp;hp or 624&nbsp;hp configurations, Shelby cooling system and front splitter. Although, Shelby did not independently confirm the performance figures, a 0&ndash;{{cvt|60|mi/h|km/h}} of 3.7 seconds and a quarter-mile in an estimated mid 11-second range has been estimated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe base upgrade package used 20-inch wheels, shod with BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard suspension bar to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the standard upgrade did not offer much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires did provide improved grip while the suspension brace resulted in better cornering.\n\nShelby had done a whole lot to improve the dynamics of the Shelby GT/SC starting with an aluminum driveshaft, employed to deliver power to the rear wheels in order to reduce the overall mass. Wilwood brakes \u2014 six-pot front and four-piston rear \u2014 for added braking performance.\n\nThe 20-inch rims on the GT/SC were painted black and were lined with [[Michelin]] Pilot Supersport tires.

This 1,571 production run matches that of the original 1968 GT500KR. In total, 1,712 units were produced, with the remaining units going to Canada, export markets and military sales.\n\nAll KRs were built by [[AutoAlliance International]] on the normal Mustang production line and then shipped to [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby Automobiles Incorporated (SAI)]] where final assembly was completed.

The suspension was tuned by SVT with unique spring rates, dampers, stabilizer bars, and strut tower brace and was sourced from [[Ford Racing]]. Unique Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires were developed for the KR with a unique compound.

For the 2011 model year, more power, new anthracite wheels, white stripes and new side scoops are optional.\n\nThe 2011 Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake post title package includes:\n* [[Ford Racing]] handling pack including dynamic adjustable dampers, lowering springs, tuned stabilizer bars, and front strut tower brace\n* 6-speed manual transmission with 3.73:1 rear axle ratio\n* Shelby/[[Ford Racing]] supercharger upgrade producing over 660 HP and 590&nbsp;ft.-lbs. of torque\n* Either a Shelby/[[Ford Racing]] or Shelby/Kenne Bell supercharger kit producing 750 HP with upgraded drive shaft, billet twin 75mm throttle body and exclusive badges\n*Optional Shelby/Kenne Bell 800 horsepower tune on pump gas\n*Borla exhaust system\n* An optional Shelby / Eibach handling pack is also available\n*Shelby-designed Alcoa 20-inch wheels in durabright or anthracite\n* Short-throw shifter\n*Forged Shelby / Baer brakes with 6 piston calipers and cross drilled / vented rotors\n*Front brake cooling ducts and behind the door side scoop\n*Unique fiberglass hood featuring classic Shelby design and pins\n*Shelby signature Super Snake stripes in either matte black or matte white\n*\"Shelby\" lettering across the rear deck lid\n*\"Super Snake\" vehicle badges and official Shelby CSM interior plate\n*Optional two tone leather interior\n*Shelby signature embroidered headrests, floor mats and other Shelby designed components\n\n====2012 Limited Edition====\nFull details on the 2012 Shelby GT500 Super Snake were revealed at the [[New York Auto Show]]. The package included a unique fiberglass hood featuring the iconic Shelby design and pins, a new Borla exhaust system, the Shelby signature Super Snake stripes that come in either matte black or matte white, and \"Super Snake\" vehicle badges. An official Shelby CSM interior plate and \"Shelby\" lettering across the rear deck lid allowed the GT500 to be fully recognizable as a Shelby vehicle, while a set of Shelby designed 20\" Alcoa wheels that came with a choice of either durabright or anthracite finished off the exterior look.\n\nThe interior also included Shelby signature embroidered headrests and floor mats, along with other Shelby designed components. These signatures could also be applied to optional two-tone leather.\n\nThe 2012 Limited Edition Super Snake produces {{cvt|750|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|590|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque from its 5.4 L [[supercharger|supercharged]] V8 engine. The power can be taken up to {{cvt|800|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with the optional upgrade. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission with 3.73:1 rear axle ratio and short-throw shifter. The car uses forged Shelby/Baer brakes with 6 piston calipers and cross drilled/vented rotors.\n\n====2012 50th Anniversary Edition====\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of Shelby American, 50 black and gold Super Snakes were manufactured. The prototype was used as a promotional vehicle and is considered a highly sought-after car by collectors.

The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also had no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes included twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT's single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR-6060]] six-speed manual transmission with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger [[Brembo]] front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach {{cvt|200|mph|km/h}}+ safely. According to Ford, the changes have resulted in a 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 was a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function was standard, as was a four-mode electronic stability control system.\n\nA Performance package was also offered, adding two-mode adjustable [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] dampers and a [[Torsen|Torsen limited-slip rear differential]].

The first fifty vehicles sold were available in limited edition colors, either in black with a triple gold stripe or white with a triple gold stripe.\n\nThe 2013 GT500 Super Snake marked the discontinuation of the Shelby \"Alcoa\" Super Snake Wheels. New, lightweight forged aluminium wheel were produced and used instead. These wheels were also used on any GT500 (even 2007\u20132012 models) that entered the Shelby American Facility to be converted into a Super Snake version. The 2013 Super Snake was also offered with a wide body option.\n\n====WELD Edition concept====\nThe WELD edition Super Snake had new wheels designed specifically and exclusively for Shelby and will be used on the next generations of Shelby Mustangs.

The engine is estimated to produce over {{cvt|1200|hp|kW}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nLike the 2012 Shelby 1000, the 2013/14 needed significant under-body and chassis strengthening modifications to handle the extra power from the engine. Driveshaft tunnel braces and billet-aluminium supports and suspension parts were used. A Custom 9\" Wavetrac Differential is used to help put power down through the rear wheels.\n\nThe Exterior received the usual \"Shelby 1000\" decals and an overlay package with a functional carbon-fiber hood, front lip spoiler, rear bumper and side skirts. A Widebody Version of the car was also offered.\n\nSince 2011, Shelby 1000 become a package for 2010-14's Ford Shelby GT500, due to the popularity of the package, Shelby American also received 2013\u201314 Ford Shelby GT500s to be converted into Shelby 1000s from customers.\n\n==Ford Performance 3rd generation Shelby GT350 (2015\u2013)==\n\n===2015/6 Ford Shelby GT350===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = 2016 Ford Shelby GT350\n| image = File:2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350.JPG\n| caption = \n| manufacturer = \n| aka = Ford Mustang GT350\n| production = 2015\u2013present\n| model_years = 2016\u2013present\n| body_style = 2-door [[fastback]] [[coupe]]\n| engine = [[Ford Modular engine#5.2 L Voodoo|5.2 L \"Voodoo\"]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = [[Tremec TR-3160 transmission|Tremec TR-3160 6-speed manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|107.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|188.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br/>{{convert|189.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (GT350R)\n| width = {{convert|75.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}  (Excluding mirrors)<br/>{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}  (Including mirrors)\n| height = {{convert|54.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br/>{{convert|53.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (GT350R)\n| weight = {{convert|3760|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (Standard) <br/> {{convert|3798|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (Tech package) <br/> {{convert|3791|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (Track package)<br/>'''GT350R:'''<br/>{{convert|3655|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (Standard) <br/> {{convert|3703|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (Electronics package)\n| ftrack         = {{convert|54.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br/>{{convert|63.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| rtrack         = {{convert|64.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br/>{{convert|64.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (GT350R)\n}}\n\nFor 2016, the GT350 has a {{cvt|5163|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[flat-plane crank]] [[V8 engine]], known as ''[[5.2 L \"Voodoo\" V8|Voodoo]]'' producing {{cvt|526|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 7,500&nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|429|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].<ref name=r&tnov2015>{{cite journal|last1=Comer|first1=Colin|title=Earning Its Stripes|magazine=[[Road & Track]]|date=November 2015|page=57}}</ref> The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)|Chevrolet Corvette C7]], [[Porsche 911 S]] and [[BMW M4]].

Beginning as a stock Mustang with a 4-speed [[manual transmission]] and 9\" live [[rear axle]], the cars were shipped to Shelby American, where they received the high-riser manifolds, Tri-Y headers, and were given larger [[Ford Galaxie]] rear [[drum brake]]s with metallic-[[Brake lining|linings]] and Kelsey-Hayes front [[disc brake]]s.\n\nThe 1965 GT350 was not built for comfort or ease of driving. There were 34 \"GT350R\" race-spec cars built specifically for competition use under [[SCCA Pro Racing|SCCA]] rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cantwell|first=Chuck|title=SCCA Shelby Mustang GT350R|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=May 2014|volume=65|issue=8|page=70}}</ref> The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including rear seats, optional colors, and an optional [[automatic transmission]]. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, while losing much of their competitiveness in the process. The 1969 GT350s and GT500s were largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang. By 1969 [[Carroll Shelby]] was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford.\n\nThe 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] in [[body in white]] form for modification by Carroll Shelby's operation, originally in [[Venice Beach]] and later at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

Smith.\n\n====1965 GT350s====\nAll 1965 GT350s were painted Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Very few GT350s were delivered to the dealer with the optional \"[[Le Mans]]\" (or \"LeMans\") top stripes, which run the length of the entire car. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built had Le Mans stripes.

Over-rider traction bars are named so because of their design being on top of the leaf spring as opposed to underneath them. There was only one transmission available, a 4-speed [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] T10 manual. The [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust system]] in the 1965 GT350 was a side-exit dual exhaust with [[glasspack]] [[muffler]]s. For this one year, the GT350 also had special {{cvt|130|mph|abbr=on}}-rated [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] \"Blue Dot\" tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 GT350 had a full size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to be allowed to race under [[SCCA]] regulations as a \"sports car\"), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center \"Cragar Shelby\" 15\" rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized \"CS\".

Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], as well as an optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later cars had their engines painted the regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.\n\nThe first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks. These cars were specifically ordered by [[Shelby American]] for conversion into 1966 GT350s. Upon delivery to Shelby-American, the cars were randomly picked for conversion. The Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order with Ford VINs. The Ford VINs were shipped in 'blocks,' but many differ significantly because the order they were taken for conversions.\n\nTotal production for 1966 was 1,373 fastbacks, including two prototypes and four drag cars, and the 252 early production models with Ford Mustang 1965 bodies. In order to help Shelby sales, Ford, the major shareholder of [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]], persuaded the rental car giant to purchase 1,003 fastbacks, including two prototypes.

The design of the original 1965 version was evident, but these styling upgrades gave the car a more aggressive appearance and achieved Carroll Shelby's goal of differentiating his car from the Mustang on which it was based.\nThe separate high-beam headlamps in the grille added more character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic \"Shelby GT350\" logo in place (except for the very early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal sequential taillights (sourced from a '67 Cougar in 1967 and a '65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear quarter panels.\nTen-spoke, fifteen-inch, cast-aluminum rims were the wheel choice with [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] white-lettered radials.\n\nThe GT350 was available with air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a whopping 8,000-rpm tachometer were joined along with a smaller analog clock, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure gauges.\n\nThe 1967 GT350 came with an iron-block, 289-cubic-inch (4.7-liter) V-8 rated at 306 horsepower and 329&nbsp;lb-foot of torque. For a pushrod design, the GT350 revved relatively high, with the horsepower peak not in full swing until the 6,000-rpm redline. 1967 was well before modern fuel injection came about, and the car used a single [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel carburetor. The true dual-exhaust with H-shaped crossover system came standard with low restriction mufflers and chrome exhaust tips. Power was routed to the ground through a sturdy, four-speed manual transmission with a single, dry-disc clutch. A three-speed automatic was made available as an option. Rear-end ratios were 3.89-to-1 for the four-speed manual and 3.50-to-1 for the automatic. Acceleration was impressive, with a 0-to-60 time of around seven seconds and a top speed of {{convert|140|mph}}.\nBraking duties were handled by 11.3-inch discs up front and drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front suspension consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.\n\nIn 1968 the 289ci V8 was replaced with a factory 302 V8 using an aluminum Cobra intake manifold and [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 600 cfm carb. The 302 had less racing parts than the 289 and was rated at 250 hp. A Paxton Supercharger was available that was rated at 33 hp at 5,200&nbsp;rpm.\n{{clear}}\n\n====1967 Shelby GT500 and 1968 Cobra GT500====\n{{Infobox automobile\n| transmission=3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] <br/>4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| name=1967 Shelby GT500<br/>1968 Shelby Cobra GT500\n| body_style=2-door [[fastback]]<br/>2-door [[convertible]]\n| engine=[[Ford FE engine#428|{{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 428]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br/>[[Ford FE engine#428 Cobra Jet|{{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 428 Cobra Jet]] V8\n| assembly= '''1967:''' [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]<br/>'''1968:''' [[Ionia, Michigan]]\n| production=1967\u20131968\n| image=File:1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Fastback (15581357832).jpg\n| weight = {{convert|1470|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = '''1968 GT500KR<br/>''' [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|2008\u20132009 Ford Shelby GT500KR]]\n}}\n[[File:1968 Shelby GT500 conv right.jpg|thumb|left|1968 convertible]]\n[http://www.houseofamericancars.com/1967-shelby-gt500-super-snake-is-back-in-perfection-for-250000-bucks/ The 1967 Shelby G.T. 500] was the first model built in the Shelby G.T. 500 range.

A large number of add-ons could be had including the \"Super Snake\" brakes, as well as larger wheels and tires which were necessary to accommodate these brakes. Additionally there were three different available superchargers, again installed by Shelby Automobiles or authorized Shelby Mod Shop, that can increase rated horsepower to 450'''*''' max H.P.. These include the [[Ford Racing]] Whipple and the rare Paxton superchargers.

Presented in concept form, the new GT350 had a supercharged version of the brand new 5.0-liter V8 engine in the 2011 Mustang GT as well as performance upgrades from [[Ford Racing]], Borla, Cragar, Baer and more.\n\nThe GT350 was a post-title upgrade available from Shelby. Customers could have their 2011 Mustangs shipped directly to Shelby's Las Vegas facility to be converted or they could deliver the car themselves. Automatic transmission was available for conversion with a naturally aspirated engine, producing up to {{cvt|430|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and manual transmission cars had the option of NA or a supercharged engine fitted with a [[Ford Racing]] supercharger to produce {{cvt|525|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, or at the expense of the warranty, {{cvt|624|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a [[Ford Racing]] suspension system (The first 100 cars were fitted with the Eibach suspension carried over from the GT500 Supersnake), Baer brakes in front and optional in rear, Custom Borla exhaust system, 19\" Cragar wheels, and more. For the exterior, Shelby installed a new front fascia, front splitter, functional hood scoop, functional brake cooling ducts, tail light trim, rear deck lid filler panel, and a rear fascia with center exhaust exit. Performance White with Guardsman Blue racing stripes were the only available color combination for 2011 models. 2012 models were available in other colors, but lost the 45th Anniversary badge of the 2011.\n\nInitial road tests of the GT350 by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' show the 2011 Shelby GT350 is capable of accelerating from 0&ndash;{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 3.7 seconds,<ref name=\"motortrend\">Lieberman, Jonny. \"First Test: 2011 Ford Shelby GT350 Prototype\".

These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible offered a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit upgrades included a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced was also included. The 2012 Shelby GT350 delivers the same performance numbers as the 2011 model. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take on a life of its own. An automatic transmission was optional with the naturally aspirated engine. Keeping the powerful engine under control was an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang a reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes were also included in the package.\n\n===2012 Shelby GTS===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = 2012 Shelby GTS\n| image =\n| caption = \n| manufacturer = \n| aka = \n| production = \n| model_years = 2012\n| engine = [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|3.7 L ''Cyclone'']] [[supercharged]] [[V6 engine|V6]]<br/>[[Ford Modular engine#5.0.C2.A0L Coyote|5.0 \"Coyote\"]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br/>2-door [[convertible]]\n| wheelbase = \n| length = \n| width = \n| height = \n| weight = \n| related = [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)]]\n| predecessor = [[Shelby Mustang#2007\u20132008 Ford Shelby GT|2007\u20132008 Ford Shelby GT]]\n| successor = 2013 Shelby GTS\n}}\nThe Shelby GTS was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show#2012|2012 New York Auto Show]], a new model designed to be attainable to the masses. It was available in both V6 and V8 form configurations. \"It's a car that reaches a younger buyer while acknowledging the economic realities of our times,\" said Shelby American president John Luft at the time.\n\nShelby installed new front and rear fascias, a \"deep draw\" fiberglass hood, black billet grille, Shelby lettering on the trunk lid and finally the signature \"Le Mans\" dual stripes over the top and triple side stripes with GTS lettering. Shelby also added a short-throw shifter with cue-ball knob, a serial number plaque and Shelby-badged floor mats. The GTS was fitted with the optional 14-inch Baer front brake system.

On the base GT, it got a front splitter conversion with a GT500 rear spoiler and quarter glass covers. The hood was made of fiberglass to save weight and the Le Mans stripes added some style. A separate wide body conversion with the option of rear-only or full all-around wide body wheel arches was also available to spice up the exterior of the 2014 Shelby GT. Among other accessories, Shelby GT front fascia, carbon laminated hood louvers, billet upper grille with Ford running pony emblem and \"Powered by Ford\" badges on the sides completed the exterior package.\n\nThe interior of the 2014 Shelby GT had been overhauled to keep up with the latest trends. Unique touches to the interior included an A-pillar gauge pod with boost, and fuel and oil pressure gauges. This modification was only available on the GT/SC conversion.\nEven the standard GT conversion got the Shelby headrest covers, special GT dash plaque and engine plate. Leather upholstery in black was standard along with electrically adjustable seats.\n\nThe \"Shelby GT Standard\" is the base pack with 430 horsepower. The slight bump in power was achieved by fitting a Borla performance exhaust as well as engine tuning. The standard package also included a Barton short shifter.\nThe \"Shelby GT/SC\" gives 100 more horsepower over the base modification. Shelby [[Ford Racing]] Whipple Supercharger kit in either 525&nbsp;hp or 624&nbsp;hp configurations, Shelby cooling system and front splitter. Although, Shelby did not independently confirm the performance figures, a 0&ndash;{{cvt|60|mi/h|km/h}} of 3.7 seconds and a quarter-mile in an estimated mid 11-second range has been estimated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe base upgrade package used 20-inch wheels, shod with BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard suspension bar to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the standard upgrade did not offer much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires did provide improved grip while the suspension brace resulted in better cornering.\n\nShelby had done a whole lot to improve the dynamics of the Shelby GT/SC starting with an aluminum driveshaft, employed to deliver power to the rear wheels in order to reduce the overall mass. Wilwood brakes \u2014 six-pot front and four-piston rear \u2014 for added braking performance.\n\nThe 20-inch rims on the GT/SC were painted black and were lined with [[Michelin]] Pilot Supersport tires.

Shelby replaced the standard front splitter and rear spoiler with elements made of carbon-fiber. The hood is also specially crafted with vents and a big bulge at the center, the same as the Shelby GT. It has 19-inch aluminum wheels fitted with [[Michelin]] tires (255/40s at the front and 275/40s at the rear.\n\nThe interior of the new Ford Mustang Shelby GT-H is based on the standard Mustang GT.

The floor mats also have \"GT-H\" logos.\n\nIt also features a [[cat-back exhaust]] system from the [[Ford Performance]]. This specifically gives the model a throatier sound. A \"Shelby-GT-H\" engine plaque is also added as well as an engine cap kit. The chassis has also been updated via the [[Ford Racing]] Handling Pack which helps deliver a race-like driving experience.

The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford's new Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford's AdvanceTrac stability control system, which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied.\n\nExternal improvements include an optional [[Special Vehicle Team|SVT]] Performance Package, which includes Goodyear EagleF1 SuperCar G: 2 tires, all-new lightweight 19-inch forged-aluminum wheels in front and 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels at the rear, a 3.73 rear axle ratio, and performance tuned front and rear shocks along with stiffer springs. The package includes a unique rear spoiler Gurney Flap for improved handling, slightly revised front and rear fascias, a new pedal box for improved clutch use, slotted brake dust shields for improved brake cooling, standard HID (high-intensity discharge) headlamps, MyKey programmable vehicle key, integrated spotter mirrors, and fold-down rear headrests. Optional is a glass top roof, previously available, starting in 2009, with the Mustang GT.\n\nThe improvements in handling and performance gives the 2011 Shelby GT500 a skidpad rating of 1.0[[g-force|g]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.caranddriver.com/files/2011-ford-mustang-shelby-gt5002011-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-road-test.pdf |title=2011 FORD SHELBY GT500 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416205508/http://media.caranddriver.com/files/2011-ford-mustang-shelby-gt5002011-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-road-test.pdf |archivedate=April 16, 2015 |magazine=Car & Driver |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref> and a [[Virginia International Raceway]] lap time of 2:58:48, making it as fast as, and sometimes faster than, cars such as the M3, Audi R8 V10, Dodge Viper SRT-10 and Porsche GT3 around this racetrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/2011-ford-gt500-bests-2010-v-i-r-lap-time-by-9-seconds-video.html|title=image |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref>\nChanges to the 2012 model year Shelby GT500 included<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselstation.com/cars/ford-shelby-gt500-2012-a3680.html|title=Ford Shelby GT500 2012|publisher=dieselstation.com|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> a new [[Recaro]] seat option.

An official Shelby CSM interior plate and \"Shelby\" lettering across the rear deck lid allowed the GT500 to be fully recognizable as a Shelby vehicle, while a set of Shelby designed 20\" Alcoa wheels that came with a choice of either durabright or anthracite finished off the exterior look.\n\nThe interior also included Shelby signature embroidered headrests and floor mats, along with other Shelby designed components. These signatures could also be applied to optional two-tone leather.\n\nThe 2012 Limited Edition Super Snake produces {{cvt|750|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|590|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque from its 5.4 L [[supercharger|supercharged]] V8 engine. The power can be taken up to {{cvt|800|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with the optional upgrade. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission with 3.73:1 rear axle ratio and short-throw shifter. The car uses forged Shelby/Baer brakes with 6 piston calipers and cross drilled/vented rotors.\n\n====2012 50th Anniversary Edition====\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of Shelby American, 50 black and gold Super Snakes were manufactured.

The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also had no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes included twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT's single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR-6060]] six-speed manual transmission with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger [[Brembo]] front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach {{cvt|200|mph|km/h}}+ safely. According to Ford, the changes have resulted in a 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 was a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function was standard, as was a four-mode electronic stability control system.\n\nA Performance package was also offered, adding two-mode adjustable [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] dampers and a [[Torsen|Torsen limited-slip rear differential]].

The tires are 295/35-19 front section and 305/35-19 rear section, the same as the previous model. The springs and shocks have been revised \u2014 10 percent softer in the rear and 10 percent firmer in the front. The tuning for the Magneride system, ABS and electronic power steering system have also been revised.\n\nThe 2019 GT350 also gets updated in the interior.

He was the eighth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]], and the final one of the direct line. Richard's father [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], died in 1376, leaving Richard as [[heir apparent]] to his grandfather, [[King Edward III]]. Upon the death of Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.\n\nDuring Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of [[regency]] councils, influenced by Richard's uncles [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock]]. [[Kingdom of England|England]] then faced various problems, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.\n\nThe king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.\n\nRichard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Black Prince kneeling before his father, King Edward III]]\n\nRichard of Bordeaux was the younger son of [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Joan, Countess of Kent]]. Edward, eldest son of [[Edward III]] and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Edward, prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330\u20131376)|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8523}}</ref>\n\nRichard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, [[Bordeaux]], in the English principality of [[Duchy of Aquitaine#Hundred Years' War|Aquitaine]], on 6 January 1367.

This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 24.</ref> Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the king's uncles was avoided.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of \"continual councils\", from which Gaunt was excluded.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of [[Taxation in medieval England|taxation]] levied through three [[poll tax]]es between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 445\u20136.</ref> By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n== Peasants' Revolt ==\n\n[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&nbsp;1475)]]\n\nWhereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] and [[Second plague pandemic|subsequent outbreaks]] of the plague.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The rebellion started in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] near London under the leaders [[Wat Tyler]], [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. John of Gaunt's [[Savoy Palace]] was burnt down. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Simon Sudbury]], who was also [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Lord High Treasurer]] [[Robert Hales]] were both killed by the rebels,<ref>Harriss (2006), pp. 230\u20131.</ref> who were demanding the complete abolition of [[serfdom]].<ref name=\"H231\">Harriss (2006), p. 231.</ref> The king, sheltered within the [[Tower of London]] with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The king set out by the [[River Thames]] on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at [[Greenwich]] made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 409.</ref> The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at [[Mile End]].<ref>Saul (1997), p. 68.</ref> He agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 68\u201370.</ref> Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and [[William Walworth]], the [[mayor of London]], pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 70\u20131.</ref> The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \"I am your captain, follow me!\", he led the mob away from the scene.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 413\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at [[Billericay]], he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt.<ref name=\"H231\"/> Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n\n== Coming of age ==\n[[File:Richard2 Anna.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne and Richard's coronation in the ''[[Liber Regalis]]'' of [[Westminster Abbey]]]]\n\nIt is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the [[chronicle|annals]].<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 424.</ref> One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], on 20 January 1382.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 90.

She was six; he was twenty-nine.]]\n\nWith national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 215\u201325.</ref> Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 227.</ref> As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.<ref>(As it turned out, she never did produce an heir: just four years later, Richard was dead.) McKisack (1959), p. 476.</ref>\n\nAlthough Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English [[Lordship of Ireland|lordships in Ireland]] were in danger of being overrun, and the [[Normans in Ireland|Anglo-Irish]] lords were pleading for the king to intervene.<ref>Tuck (1985), p. 204.</ref> In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 511.</ref> The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 279\u201381.</ref> It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened his support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n\n== Second crisis of 1397\u201399 ==\nThe period that historians refer to as the \"tyranny\" of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 203.</ref> The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 371\u20135.</ref> It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386\u201388 and eliminate them as threats to his power.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 479.</ref> Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 378.</ref> Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 378\u20139.</ref> Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel's brother [[Thomas Arundel]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life.<ref>Tuck (1985), p. 210.</ref> Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting [[retinue|retainers]] for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n[[File:Thomas of Woodstock.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Murder of Thomas of Woodstock in [[Calais]] in 1397]]\n\n[[File:Johnofgaunt.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John of Gaunt]] had been at the centre of English politics for over thirty years, and his death in 1399 led to insecurity.]]\n\nThese actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt, but with the support of a large group of other magnates, many of whom were rewarded with new titles, who were disparagingly referred to as Richard's \"duketti\".<ref name=\"Saul (2005), p. 63.\">Saul (2005), p. 63.</ref> These included the former Appellants [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby]], who was made [[Duke of Hereford]], and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, who was created [[Duke of Norfolk]].

Mowbray vehemently denied these charges, as such a claim would have amounted to treason.<ref name=\"Saul (2005), p. 63.\"/> A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle, but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 482.</ref> On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt died.

It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.<ref>Gardiner, Samuel R.

[[National Gallery]], London.]]\nIn the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 331\u20132.</ref> In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as \"[[highness]]\", now \"royal [[majesty]]\", or \"high majesty\" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 340\u20132.</ref> The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 344\u201354.</ref>\n\nRichard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 489\u201390.</ref> Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 490\u20131.</ref> In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France.<ref name=\"S439\">Saul (1997), p. 439.</ref> At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them [[livery]] [[heraldic badge|badges]] with his [[White Hart]].<ref>Harris (2005), p. 28.</ref> He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 332, 346.</ref>\n\n== Patronage and the arts ==\nAs part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image. Unlike any other English king before him, he had himself portrayed in [[panel painting]]s of elevated majesty,<ref>Saul (1997), p. 238.</ref> of which two survive: an over life-size [[Westminster Abbey]] portrait (c.&nbsp;1390), and the Wilton Diptych (1394\u201399), a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign.<ref>Alexander and Binski, pp.&nbsp;134\u2013135.

On the other hand, the ''Traison et Mort Chronicle'' suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session.

until he was [[deposed]] in 1399. He was the eighth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]], and the final one of the direct line. Richard's father [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], died in 1376, leaving Richard as [[heir apparent]] to his grandfather, [[King Edward III]]. Upon the death of Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.\n\nDuring Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of [[regency]] councils, influenced by Richard's uncles [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock]]. [[Kingdom of England|England]] then faced various problems, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.\n\nThe king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.\n\nRichard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Black Prince kneeling before his father, King Edward III]]\n\nRichard of Bordeaux was the younger son of [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Joan, Countess of Kent]]. Edward, eldest son of [[Edward III]] and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Edward, prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330\u20131376)|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8523}}</ref>\n\nRichard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, [[Bordeaux]], in the English principality of [[Duchy of Aquitaine#Hundred Years' War|Aquitaine]], on 6 January 1367.

This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 24.</ref> Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the king's uncles was avoided.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of \"continual councils\", from which Gaunt was excluded.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs.

A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 215\u201325.</ref> Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 227.</ref> As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age.

[[National Gallery]], London.]]\nIn the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 331\u20132.</ref> In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as \"[[highness]]\", now \"royal [[majesty]]\", or \"high majesty\" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 340\u20132.</ref> The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 344\u201354.</ref>\n\nRichard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 489\u201390.</ref> Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility.

The concept and model of the digital twin was publicly introduced in 2002 by Grieves, then of the [[University of Michigan]], at a [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]] conference in [[Troy, Michigan]].<ref>Grieves, M., ''Virtually Intelligent Product Systems: Digital and Physical Twins'', in ''Complex Systems Engineering: Theory and Practice'', S. Flumerfelt, et al., Editors. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. p. 175-200.</ref> Grieves proposed the digital twin as the conceptual model underlying [[product lifecycle]] management (PLM).\n\nThe concept, which had a few different names, was subsequently called the \"digital twin\" by John Vickers of NASA in a 2010 Roadmap Report.<ref>Piascik, R., et al., ''Technology Area 12: Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing Road Map''. 2010, NASA Office of Chief Technologist.</ref> The digital twin concept consists of three distinct parts: the physical product, the digital/virtual product, and connections between the two products. The connections between the physical product and the digital/virtual product is data that flows from the physical product to the digital/virtual product and information that is available from the digital/virtual product to the physical environment.\n\nThe concept was divided into types later<ref name=\":10\">Grieves, M. and J. Vickers, ''Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems'', in ''Trans-Disciplinary Perspectives on System Complexity'', F.-J. Kahlen, S. Flumerfelt, and A. Alves, Editors. 2016, Springer: Switzerland. p. 85-114.</ref>. The types are the digital twin prototype (DTP), the digital twin instance (DTI), and the digital twin aggregate (DTA). The DTP consists of the designs, analyses, and processes to realize a physical product. The DTP exists before there is a physical product. The DTI is the digital twin of each individual instance of the product once it is manufactured. The DTA is the aggregation of DTIs whose data and information can be used for interrogation about the physical product, prognostics, and learning. The specific information contained in the digital twins is driven by use cases. The digital twin is a logical construct, meaning that the actual data and information may be contained in other applications.\n\nA digital twin in the workplace is often considered part of [[robotic process automation]] (RPA) and, per industry-analyst firm Gartner, is part of the broader and emerging \"hyperautomation\" category.{{Cn|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2019/10/21/breaking-gartner-announces-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/#46f232dc4074|title=Gartner Announces Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2020|last=High|first=Peter|date=|website=Forbes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAn example of how digital twins are used to optimize machines is with the maintenance of power generation equipment such as power generation turbines, jet engines and locomotives.\nIn [[enterprise architecture]] (EA), architects create EA blueprints as digital twin for the organization.<ref>Gartner Definition Digital Twin|https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/digital-twin</ref><ref>Example Digital Twin|https://www.dragon1.com/content/visualization/286208/enterprise-architecture-blueprint-hospital</ref>\n\nAnother example of digital twins is the use of [[3D modeling]] to create digital companions for the physical objects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shaping the Future of the IoT|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibdm1zU6G3Q|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=PTC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=On Track For The Future \u2013 The Siemens Digital Twin Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzPWBHT1Hl4|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=Siemens}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Digital twins' could make decisions for us within 5 years, John Smart says|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/digital-twins-could-make-decisions-for-us-within-5-years-john-smart-says/story-e6frfrnr-1227065953093|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=news.com.au}}</ref><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> It can be used to view the status of the actual physical object, which provides a way to project physical objects into the digital world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Twin for MRO|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-twin-mro-operations-adam-g\u0105siorek|website=LinkedIn Pulse|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=Transition Technologies}}</ref> For example, when sensors collect data from a connected device, the sensor data can be used to update a \"digital twin\" copy of the device's state in real time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marr|first1=Bernard|title=What Is Digital Twin Technology \u2013 And Why Is It So Important?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/03/06/what-is-digital-twin-technology-and-why-is-it-so-important/#120111ec2e2a|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Grieves|first1=Michael|title=Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication|url=https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/camid/documents/1411.0_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_Dr_Grieves.pdf|website=Florida Institute of Technology|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GE Doubles Down On 'Digital Twins' For Business Knowledge|url=http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/software-as-a-service/ge-doubles-down-on-digital-twins-for-business-knowledge/d/d-id/1327256|website=InformationWeek|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref> The term \"device shadow\" is also used for the concept of a digital twin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-shadows.html|title=Device Shadows for AWS IoT \u2013 AWS IoT|website=docs.aws.amazon.com}}</ref> The digital twin is meant to be an up-to-date and accurate copy of the physical object's properties and states, including shape, position, gesture, status and motion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Twin for SLM|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVCTKPjfr0|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=Transition Technologies}}</ref>\n\nA digital twin also can be used for [[:wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], [[diagnostics]] and [[prognostics]] to optimize asset performance and utilization.

In the manufacturing process, the digital twin is like a virtual replica of the near-time occurrences in the factory. Thousands of sensors are being placed throughout the physical manufacturing process, all collecting data from different dimensions, such as environmental conditions, behavioural characteristics of the machine and work that is being performed. All this data is continuously communicating and collected by the digital twin.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDue to the Internet of Things, digital twins have become more affordable and could drive the future of the manufacturing industry.

This starts with modularity and leading to higher effectiveness in the production system. Furthermore, autonomy enables the production system to respond to unexpected events in an efficient and intelligent way. Lastly, connectivity like the Internet of Things, makes the closing of the digitalization loop possible, by then allowing the following cycle of product design and promotion to be optimized for higher performance.<ref name=\"Rosen2015\" /> This may lead to increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty when products can determine a problem before actually breaking down.<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, as storage and computing costs are becoming less expensive, the ways in which digital twins are used are expanding.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Firm-level dynamics ===\nWhen looking more specifically on a firm-level, several incumbent firms are investing in a digital twin increase effectiveness. Some of these firms are: [[General Electric]], Arctic Wind, and Mechanical Solutions Inc.\n\nFirstly, General Electric has a system based on digital twins and uses this software to administer and analyze data from [[wind turbine]]s, [[oil rig]]s and [[aircraft]] they produce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hannovermesse.de/en/news/how-digital-twins-are-revolutionizing-industry.xhtml|title=How digital twins are revolutionizing industry|website=HannoverMesse}}</ref> The system they use for aircraft collects, per engine, all data of a flight between London and Paris. The data is transferred to a data centre, where it generates a real-time digital twin of each engine. In this way, General Electric is able to detect potential defects or faults already during the flight. So, if a part of the engine is causing a fault, the personnel that is responsible for maintenance can have the replacement part ready at the airport where the aircraft will land.\n\nSecondly, Arctic Wind, a firm that owns and operates multiple [[wind farm|wind power plants]] in Norway, wanted a solution to keep track of the health of their wind turbines they produce. These turbines are costly, and all parts require constant monitoring. The maintenance of these turbines is challenging because of long periods of darkness and low temperatures. To find a solution against the elements, they have installed sensors on all their wind turbines and the data that comes from these sensors is transported over 1,000 miles away to the office. This provides the digital twin real-time data of the wind turbines, therefore employees are able to visualize any problems as they happen. In addition, the digital twin provides the firm with future prognoses, so they can run simulations of how the turbines will perform under different extreme circumstances. In this way, Arctic Wind knows if they have to shut down operations during an extreme storm or not.\n\nLastly, Mechanical Solutions Inc. (MSI), a company which specializes in [[turbomachinery|turbomachines]], used [[Siemens]] STAR-CMM+ software. This software enables product development organizations to make use of a digital twin. MSI successfully implemented this software in their process chain as a troubleshooting and design tool. This enabled the cost-efficient engineering process to solve very complex problems, they could not have solved without the digital twin.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Ferguson, Stephen |author2=Bennett, Edward |author3=Ivashchenko, Artem |date=April 2017|title=Digital twin tackles design challenges|journal=World Pumps|volume=2017|issue=4|pages=26\u201328|doi=10.1016/S0262-1762(17)30139-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Embedded digital twin ===\nRemembering that a definition of digital twin is a real time digital replica of a physical device, manufacturers are embedding digital twin in their device.

Digital twins will not only lead to better resolutions when defining the health of an individual patient but also change the expected image of a healthy patient. Previously, 'healthy' was seen as the absence of disease indications. Now, 'healthy' patients can be compared to the rest of the population in order to really define healthy.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, the emergence of the digital twin in healthcare also brings some downsides. The digital twin may lead to inequality, as the technology might not be accessible for everyone by widening the gap between the rich and poor.

However, by making use of a cloud-based platform and a modular organization, it may also be possible for smaller organizations to contribute to a certain module.<ref name=\":6\" /> One of those organizations is Sim&Cure, which is the first company to market a patient-based simulation model for treatment of aneurysms.

Digital twins in the automobile industry are implemented by using existing data in order to facilitate processes and reduce marginal costs. Currently, automobile designers expand the existing physical materiality by incorporating software-based digital abilities.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> A specific example of digital twin technology in the automotive industry is where automotive engineers use digital twin technology in combination with the firm's analytical tool in order to analyze how a specific car is driven. In doing so, they can suggest incorporating new features in the car that can reduce car accidents on the road, which was previously not possible in such a short time frame.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cearley |first1=David W. |last2=Burker |first2=Brian |last3=Searle |first3=Samantha |last4=Walker |first4=Mike J. |title=The top 10 strategic technology trends for 2013 |journal=Gartner Trends 2018 |date=3 October 2017 |pages=1\u201324 |url=http://brilliantdude.com/solves/content/GartnerTrends2018.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Firm-level dynamics (Volkswagen & Tesla) ===\nOne of the incumbent automobile firms that is incorporating digital twin technology in their business processes is [[Volkswagen]]. The use of this technology, which they refer to as a \"virtual twin\", has allowed Volkswagen to create digital 3D prototypes of their different car models, such as the Golf.<ref name=Volkswagen2018>{{cite web |last1=Volkswagen |title=The virtual twin |url=http://inside.volkswagen.com/The-virtual-twin.html |website=Volkswagen Inside |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> The Pre-Series Center in [[Wolfsburg]] is the specialized department of the virtual prototype team, where they put together digital representations of the vehicles, that are used from the point of assembly and throughout the lifecycle of the cars. The digital twins support the production process and development of the cars, by providing all employees worldwide with detailed and real-time data of the model. Leingang, one of the leaders of the virtual prototype team, describes how the implementation of digital twins helps Volkswagen to optimize their product lifecycle management. \"Our work helps people in design, quality assurance, body construction, and assembly. (...) This is because the 'digital twin' lets our colleagues know early on what exactly needs to be done when mounting a particular component.\".<ref name=\"Volkswagen2018\" /> Another innovative department in Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's Virtual Engineering Lab, further develops the use of digital representations and digital tools in combination with [[augmented reality]]. Here they make use of the [[Microsoft HoloLens]], which enables engineers and designers to view and modify digital twins, assisted by other technologies such as gesture control and voice commands.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Volkswagen |title=ow Volkswagen is Developing the Car of the Future Virtually |url=https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2017/03/how-volkswagen-is-developing-the-car-of-the-future-virtually.html# |website=Volkswagen |accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike incumbents in the automobile industry that have been wrapping digital technologies around their traditional products in the last couple of years, relatively new player [[Tesla, Inc.]] has been involved with (digitally) innovating the industry from the moment the firm entered the market.<ref name=Tesla>{{cite web |last1=Tesla |title=About |url=https://www.tesla.com/about |website=Tesla}}</ref> Besides stimulating the switch towards the adoption and use of electric vehicles by the mainstream, Tesla has been innovating vehicles by implementing software-based tools in the physical product, including digital twin technology.<ref name=\"Tesla\" /><ref name=\"The Economist 2018\">{{cite web |last1=The Economist |title=Modern manufacturing's triple play: Digital twins, analytics and the internet of things |url=https://expectexceptional.economist.com/digital-twins-analytics-internet-of-things.html |website=The Economist |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> Tesla creates a digital twin for every electric car they manufacture, which provides the firm with a constant stream of data going from the vehicle to the manufacturing plant and vice versa, allowing Tesla to increase the reliability of the car by predicting any kind of maintenance from a distance.<ref name=\"Overton 2016\" /> The digital nature of Tesla vehicles, enables the firm to resolve most maintenance issues remotely, by using the received data of the digital twin, for example, \"if a driver has a rattle in a door, it can be fixed by downloading software that tweaks the hydraulics of that particular door\".<ref name=\"Overton 2016\">{{cite web |last1=Overton |first1=Jerry |last2=Brigham |first2=JC |title=DATA-DRIVEN SIMULATIONS INNOVATE THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS |url=http://assets1.csc.com/big_data/downloads/MD_9726a-17_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_v5.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> Tesla continues to develop and update their software and other digital technologies, in order to sustain their status of a successful innovator.<ref name=\"The Economist 2018\" />\n\nComparing the strategies of these two well-known automotive firms, it seems that Volkswagen has implemented digital twin technology as an offensive reaction to Tesla's innovative approach to the automotive industry. By transitioning to the new technology, Volkswagen has framed this challenge as an opportunity by creating a new, specialised department for virtual prototyping rather than fleeing to either a new market or a niche.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adner |first1=Ron |last2=Snow |first2=Daniel |title=Old technology responses to new technology threats: demand heterogeneity and technology retreats |journal=Industrial and Corporate Change |date=October 1, 2010 |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1655\u20131675|doi=10.1093/icc/dtq046 }}</ref>\n\n== The characteristics of digital twin technology ==\nDigital technologies have certain characteristics that distinguish them from other technologies. These characteristics, in turn, have certain consequences. Digital twins have the following characteristics.\n\n=== Connectivity ===\nOne of the main characteristics of digital twin technology is its connectivity. The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings forward numerous new technologies. The development of IoT also brings forward the development of digital twin technology. This technology shows many characteristics that have similarities with the character of the IoT, namely its connective nature. First and foremost, the technology enables connectivity between the physical component and its digital counterpart. The basis of digital twins is based on this connection, without it, digital twin technology would not exist. As described in the previous section, this connectivity is created by sensors on the physical product which obtain data and integrate and communicate this data through various integration technologies. Digital twin technology enables increased connectivity between organizations, products, and customers.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Porter |first1=Michael |last2=Heppelman |first2=James |title=How smart, connected products are transforming companies |journal=Harvard Business Review |date=October 2015 |volume=93 |pages=96\u2013114 |url=https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-companies}}</ref> For example, connectivity between partners in a supply chain can be increased by enabling members of this supply chain to check the digital twin of a product or asset. These partners can then check the status of this product by simply checking the digital twin.\n\nAlso, connectivity with customers can be increased.\n\nServitization is the process of organizations that are adding value to their core corporate offerings through services.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vandermerwe |first1=Sandra |last2=Rada |first2=Juan |title=Servitization of business: Adding value by adding services |journal=European Management Journal |date=Winter 1988 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=314\u2013324 |doi=10.1016/0263-2373(88)90033-3 }}</ref> In the case of the example of engines, the manufacturing of the engine is the core offering of this organization, they then add value by providing a service of checking the engine and offering maintenance.\n\n=== Homogenization ===\nDigital twins can be further characterized as a digital technology that is both the consequence and an enabler of the homogenization of data. Due to the fact that any type of information or content can now be stored and transmitted in the same digital form, it can be used to create a virtual representation of the product (in the form of a digital twin), thus decoupling the information from its physical form.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tilson |first1=David |last2=Lyytinen |first2=Kalle |last3=S\u00f8rensen |first3=Carsten |title=Digital Infrastructures: The Missing IS Research Agenda |journal=Information Systems Research |date=December 2010 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=748\u2013759 |url=https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5210/h14/pensumliste/articles/tilson-et-al-2010.pdf|doi=10.1287/isre.1100.0318 |jstor=23015642}}</ref> Therefore, the homogenization of data and the decoupling of the information from its physical artifact, have allowed digital twins to come into existence. However, digital twins also enable increasingly more information on physical products to be stored digitally and become decoupled from the product itself.<ref name=Yoo2012>{{cite journal |last1=Yoo |first1=Youngjin |last2=Boland |first2=Richard |last3=Lyytinen |first3=Kalle |last4=Majchrzak |first4=Ann |title=Organizing for innovation in the digitized world. |journal=Organization Science |date=September\u2013October 2012 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=1398\u20131408 |jstor=23252314 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1120.0771 }}</ref>\n\nAs data is increasingly digitized, it can be transmitted, stored and computed in fast and low-cost ways.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> According to [[Moore's law]], computing power will continue to increase exponentially over the coming years, while the cost of computing decreases significantly. This would, therefore, lead to lower marginal costs of developing digital twins and make it comparatively much cheaper to test, predict, and solve problems on virtual representations rather than testing on physical models and waiting for physical products to break before intervening.\n\nAnother consequence of the homogenization and decoupling of information is that the user experience converges. As information from physical objects is digitized, a single artifact can have multiple new affordances.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> Digital twin technology allows detailed information about a physical object to be shared with a larger number of agents, unconstrained by physical location or time.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Grieves |first1=Michael |last2=Vickers |first2=John |title=Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems |journal=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems |date=17 August 2016 |pages=85\u2013113 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4 |isbn=978-3-319-38754-3 }}</ref> In his white paper on digital twin technology in the manufacturing industry, Michael Grieves noted the following about the consequences of homogenization enabled by digital twins:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grieves |first1=Michael |title=Digital twin: manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication. Retrieved from |url=https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/camid/documents/1411.0_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_Dr_Grieves.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|In the past, factory managers had their office overlooking the factory so that they could get a feel for what was happening on the factory floor. With the digital twin, not only the factory manager, but everyone associated with factory production could have that same virtual window to not only a single factory, but to all the factories across the globe. (Grieves, 2014, p.&nbsp;5)}}\n\n=== Reprogrammable and smart ===\nAs stated above, a digital twin enables a physical product to be reprogrammable in a certain way. Furthermore, the digital twin is also reprogrammable in an automatic manner. Through the sensors on the physical product, artificial intelligence technologies, and [[predictive analytics]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Dean |title=Seeing double: why IoT digital twins will change the face of manufacturing |url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3219847/internet-of-things/seeing-double-why-iot-digital-twins-will-change-the-face-of-manufacturing.html |website=Networkworld |accessdate=September 23, 2018|date=2017-08-25 }}</ref> A consequence of this reprogrammable nature is the emergence of functionalities. If we take the example of an engine again, digital twins can be used to collect data about the performance of the engine and if needed adjust the engine, creating a newer version of the product. Also, servitization can be seen as a consequence of the reprogrammable nature as well. Manufactures can be responsible for observing the digital twin, making adjustments, or reprogramming the digital twin when needed and they can offer this as an extra service.\n\n=== Digital traces ===\nAnother characteristic that can be observed, is the fact that digital twin technologies leave digital traces. These traces can be used by engineers for example, when a machine malfunctions to go back and check the traces of the digital twin, to diagnose where the problem occurred.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cai |first1=Yi |title=Sensor Data and Information Fusion to Construct Digital-twins Virtual Machine Tools for Cyber-physical Manufacturing |journal=Procedia Manufacturing |date=2017 |volume=10 |pages=1031\u20131042 |doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.094 |doi-access=free }}</ref> These diagnoses can in the future also be used by the manufacturer of these machines, to improve their designs so that these same malfunctions will occur less often in the future.\n\n=== Modularity ===\nIn the sense of the manufacturing industry, modularity can be described as the design and customization of products and production modules.<ref name=Rosen2015>{{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=Roland |last2=von Wichert |first2=Georg |last3=Lo |first3=George |last4=Bettenhausen |first4=Kurt D. |title=About The Importance of Autonomy and Digital Twins for the Future of Manufacturing |journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine |date=2015 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=567\u2013572 |doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.141 |doi-access=free }}</ref> By adding modularity to the manufacturing models, manufacturers gain the ability to tweak models and machines.

The concept and model of the digital twin was publicly introduced in 2002 by Grieves, then of the [[University of Michigan]], at a [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]] conference in [[Troy, Michigan]].<ref>Grieves, M., ''Virtually Intelligent Product Systems: Digital and Physical Twins'', in ''Complex Systems Engineering: Theory and Practice'', S. Flumerfelt, et al., Editors. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. p. 175-200.</ref> Grieves proposed the digital twin as the conceptual model underlying [[product lifecycle]] management (PLM).\n\nThe concept, which had a few different names, was subsequently called the \"digital twin\" by John Vickers of NASA in a 2010 Roadmap Report.<ref>Piascik, R., et al., ''Technology Area 12: Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing Road Map''. 2010, NASA Office of Chief Technologist.</ref> The digital twin concept consists of three distinct parts: the physical product, the digital/virtual product, and connections between the two products. The connections between the physical product and the digital/virtual product is data that flows from the physical product to the digital/virtual product and information that is available from the digital/virtual product to the physical environment.\n\nThe concept was divided into types later<ref name=\":10\">Grieves, M. and J. Vickers, ''Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems'', in ''Trans-Disciplinary Perspectives on System Complexity'', F.-J. Kahlen, S. Flumerfelt, and A. Alves, Editors. 2016, Springer: Switzerland. p. 85-114.</ref>. The types are the digital twin prototype (DTP), the digital twin instance (DTI), and the digital twin aggregate (DTA). The DTP consists of the designs, analyses, and processes to realize a physical product. The DTP exists before there is a physical product. The DTI is the digital twin of each individual instance of the product once it is manufactured. The DTA is the aggregation of DTIs whose data and information can be used for interrogation about the physical product, prognostics, and learning. The specific information contained in the digital twins is driven by use cases. The digital twin is a logical construct, meaning that the actual data and information may be contained in other applications.\n\nA digital twin in the workplace is often considered part of [[robotic process automation]] (RPA) and, per industry-analyst firm Gartner, is part of the broader and emerging \"hyperautomation\" category.{{Cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAn example of how digital twins are used to optimize machines is with the maintenance of power generation equipment such as power generation turbines, jet engines and locomotives.\nIn [[enterprise architecture]] (EA), architects create EA blueprints as digital twin for the organization.<ref>Gartner Definition Digital Twin|https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/digital-twin</ref><ref>Example Digital Twin|https://www.dragon1.com/content/visualization/286208/enterprise-architecture-blueprint-hospital</ref>\n\nAnother example of digital twins is the use of [[3D modeling]] to create digital companions for the physical objects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shaping the Future of the IoT|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibdm1zU6G3Q|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=PTC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=On Track For The Future \u2013 The Siemens Digital Twin Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzPWBHT1Hl4|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=Siemens}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Digital twins' could make decisions for us within 5 years, John Smart says|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/digital-twins-could-make-decisions-for-us-within-5-years-john-smart-says/story-e6frfrnr-1227065953093|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=news.com.au}}</ref><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> It can be used to view the status of the actual physical object, which provides a way to project physical objects into the digital world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Twin for MRO|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-twin-mro-operations-adam-g\u0105siorek|website=LinkedIn Pulse|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=Transition Technologies}}</ref> For example, when sensors collect data from a connected device, the sensor data can be used to update a \"digital twin\" copy of the device's state in real time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marr|first1=Bernard|title=What Is Digital Twin Technology \u2013 And Why Is It So Important?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/03/06/what-is-digital-twin-technology-and-why-is-it-so-important/#120111ec2e2a|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Grieves|first1=Michael|title=Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication|url=https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/camid/documents/1411.0_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_Dr_Grieves.pdf|website=Florida Institute of Technology|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GE Doubles Down On 'Digital Twins' For Business Knowledge|url=http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/software-as-a-service/ge-doubles-down-on-digital-twins-for-business-knowledge/d/d-id/1327256|website=InformationWeek|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref> The term \"device shadow\" is also used for the concept of a digital twin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-shadows.html|title=Device Shadows for AWS IoT \u2013 AWS IoT|website=docs.aws.amazon.com}}</ref> The digital twin is meant to be an up-to-date and accurate copy of the physical object's properties and states, including shape, position, gesture, status and motion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Twin for SLM|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVCTKPjfr0|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=Transition Technologies}}</ref>\n\nA digital twin also can be used for [[:wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], [[diagnostics]] and [[prognostics]] to optimize asset performance and utilization.

This starts with modularity and leading to higher effectiveness in the production system. Furthermore, autonomy enables the production system to respond to unexpected events in an efficient and intelligent way. Lastly, connectivity like the Internet of Things, makes the closing of the digitalization loop possible, by then allowing the following cycle of product design and promotion to be optimized for higher performance.<ref name=\"Rosen2015\" /> This may lead to increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty when products can determine a problem before actually breaking down.<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, as storage and computing costs are becoming less expensive, the ways in which digital twins are used are expanding.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Firm-level dynamics ===\nWhen looking more specifically on a firm-level, several incumbent firms are investing in a digital twin increase effectiveness. Some of these firms are: [[General Electric]], Arctic Wind, and Mechanical Solutions Inc.\n\nFirstly, General Electric has a system based on digital twins and uses this software to administer and analyze data from [[wind turbine]]s, [[oil rig]]s and [[aircraft]] they produce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hannovermesse.de/en/news/how-digital-twins-are-revolutionizing-industry.xhtml|title=How digital twins are revolutionizing industry|website=HannoverMesse}}</ref> The system they use for aircraft collects, per engine, all data of a flight between London and Paris. The data is transferred to a data centre, where it generates a real-time digital twin of each engine. In this way, General Electric is able to detect potential defects or faults already during the flight. So, if a part of the engine is causing a fault, the personnel that is responsible for maintenance can have the replacement part ready at the airport where the aircraft will land.\n\nSecondly, Arctic Wind, a firm that owns and operates multiple [[wind farm|wind power plants]] in Norway, wanted a solution to keep track of the health of their wind turbines they produce. These turbines are costly, and all parts require constant monitoring. The maintenance of these turbines is challenging because of long periods of darkness and low temperatures. To find a solution against the elements, they have installed sensors on all their wind turbines and the data that comes from these sensors is transported over 1,000 miles away to the office. This provides the digital twin real-time data of the wind turbines, therefore employees are able to visualize any problems as they happen. In addition, the digital twin provides the firm with future prognoses, so they can run simulations of how the turbines will perform under different extreme circumstances. In this way, Arctic Wind knows if they have to shut down operations during an extreme storm or not.\n\nLastly, Mechanical Solutions Inc. (MSI), a company which specializes in [[turbomachinery|turbomachines]], used [[Siemens]] STAR-CMM+ software. This software enables product development organizations to make use of a digital twin. MSI successfully implemented this software in their process chain as a troubleshooting and design tool. This enabled the cost-efficient engineering process to solve very complex problems, they could not have solved without the digital twin.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Ferguson, Stephen |author2=Bennett, Edward |author3=Ivashchenko, Artem |date=April 2017|title=Digital twin tackles design challenges|journal=World Pumps|volume=2017|issue=4|pages=26\u201328|doi=10.1016/S0262-1762(17)30139-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Embedded digital twin ===\nRemembering that a definition of digital twin is a real time digital replica of a physical device, manufacturers are embedding digital twin in their device.

This can ultimately lead to a virtual patient, with detailed description of the healthy state of an individual patient and not only on previous records. Furthermore, the digital twin enables individual's records to be compared to the population in order to easier find patterns with great detail.<ref name=\":5\" /> The biggest benefit of the digital twin on the healthcare industry is the fact that healthcare can be tailored to anticipate on the responses of individual patients. Digital twins will not only lead to better resolutions when defining the health of an individual patient but also change the expected image of a healthy patient. Previously, 'healthy' was seen as the absence of disease indications. Now, 'healthy' patients can be compared to the rest of the population in order to really define healthy.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, the emergence of the digital twin in healthcare also brings some downsides. The digital twin may lead to inequality, as the technology might not be accessible for everyone by widening the gap between the rich and poor.

However, by making use of a cloud-based platform and a modular organization, it may also be possible for smaller organizations to contribute to a certain module.<ref name=\":6\" /> One of those organizations is Sim&Cure, which is the first company to market a patient-based simulation model for treatment of aneurysms. This treatment allows prediction of deployment of medical devices.

Digital twins in the automobile industry are implemented by using existing data in order to facilitate processes and reduce marginal costs. Currently, automobile designers expand the existing physical materiality by incorporating software-based digital abilities.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> A specific example of digital twin technology in the automotive industry is where automotive engineers use digital twin technology in combination with the firm's analytical tool in order to analyze how a specific car is driven. In doing so, they can suggest incorporating new features in the car that can reduce car accidents on the road, which was previously not possible in such a short time frame.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cearley |first1=David W. |last2=Burker |first2=Brian |last3=Searle |first3=Samantha |last4=Walker |first4=Mike J. |title=The top 10 strategic technology trends for 2013 |journal=Gartner Trends 2018 |date=3 October 2017 |pages=1\u201324 |url=http://brilliantdude.com/solves/content/GartnerTrends2018.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Firm-level dynamics (Volkswagen & Tesla) ===\nOne of the incumbent automobile firms that is incorporating digital twin technology in their business processes is [[Volkswagen]]. The use of this technology, which they refer to as a \"virtual twin\", has allowed Volkswagen to create digital 3D prototypes of their different car models, such as the Golf.<ref name=Volkswagen2018>{{cite web |last1=Volkswagen |title=The virtual twin |url=http://inside.volkswagen.com/The-virtual-twin.html |website=Volkswagen Inside |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> The Pre-Series Center in [[Wolfsburg]] is the specialized department of the virtual prototype team, where they put together digital representations of the vehicles, that are used from the point of assembly and throughout the lifecycle of the cars. The digital twins support the production process and development of the cars, by providing all employees worldwide with detailed and real-time data of the model. Leingang, one of the leaders of the virtual prototype team, describes how the implementation of digital twins helps Volkswagen to optimize their product lifecycle management. \"Our work helps people in design, quality assurance, body construction, and assembly. (...) This is because the 'digital twin' lets our colleagues know early on what exactly needs to be done when mounting a particular component.\".<ref name=\"Volkswagen2018\" /> Another innovative department in Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's Virtual Engineering Lab, further develops the use of digital representations and digital tools in combination with [[augmented reality]]. Here they make use of the [[Microsoft HoloLens]], which enables engineers and designers to view and modify digital twins, assisted by other technologies such as gesture control and voice commands.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Volkswagen |title=ow Volkswagen is Developing the Car of the Future Virtually |url=https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2017/03/how-volkswagen-is-developing-the-car-of-the-future-virtually.html# |website=Volkswagen |accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike incumbents in the automobile industry that have been wrapping digital technologies around their traditional products in the last couple of years, relatively new player [[Tesla, Inc.]] has been involved with (digitally) innovating the industry from the moment the firm entered the market.<ref name=Tesla>{{cite web |last1=Tesla |title=About |url=https://www.tesla.com/about |website=Tesla}}</ref> Besides stimulating the switch towards the adoption and use of electric vehicles by the mainstream, Tesla has been innovating vehicles by implementing software-based tools in the physical product, including digital twin technology.<ref name=\"Tesla\" /><ref name=\"The Economist 2018\">{{cite web |last1=The Economist |title=Modern manufacturing's triple play: Digital twins, analytics and the internet of things |url=https://expectexceptional.economist.com/digital-twins-analytics-internet-of-things.html |website=The Economist |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> Tesla creates a digital twin for every electric car they manufacture, which provides the firm with a constant stream of data going from the vehicle to the manufacturing plant and vice versa, allowing Tesla to increase the reliability of the car by predicting any kind of maintenance from a distance.<ref name=\"Overton 2016\" /> The digital nature of Tesla vehicles, enables the firm to resolve most maintenance issues remotely, by using the received data of the digital twin, for example, \"if a driver has a rattle in a door, it can be fixed by downloading software that tweaks the hydraulics of that particular door\".<ref name=\"Overton 2016\">{{cite web |last1=Overton |first1=Jerry |last2=Brigham |first2=JC |title=DATA-DRIVEN SIMULATIONS INNOVATE THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS |url=http://assets1.csc.com/big_data/downloads/MD_9726a-17_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_v5.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> Tesla continues to develop and update their software and other digital technologies, in order to sustain their status of a successful innovator.<ref name=\"The Economist 2018\" />\n\nComparing the strategies of these two well-known automotive firms, it seems that Volkswagen has implemented digital twin technology as an offensive reaction to Tesla's innovative approach to the automotive industry. By transitioning to the new technology, Volkswagen has framed this challenge as an opportunity by creating a new, specialised department for virtual prototyping rather than fleeing to either a new market or a niche.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adner |first1=Ron |last2=Snow |first2=Daniel |title=Old technology responses to new technology threats: demand heterogeneity and technology retreats |journal=Industrial and Corporate Change |date=October 1, 2010 |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1655\u20131675|doi=10.1093/icc/dtq046 }}</ref>\n\n== The characteristics of digital twin technology ==\nDigital technologies have certain characteristics that distinguish them from other technologies. These characteristics, in turn, have certain consequences. Digital twins have the following characteristics.\n\n=== Connectivity ===\nOne of the main characteristics of digital twin technology is its connectivity. The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings forward numerous new technologies. The development of IoT also brings forward the development of digital twin technology. This technology shows many characteristics that have similarities with the character of the IoT, namely its connective nature. First and foremost, the technology enables connectivity between the physical component and its digital counterpart. The basis of digital twins is based on this connection, without it, digital twin technology would not exist. As described in the previous section, this connectivity is created by sensors on the physical product which obtain data and integrate and communicate this data through various integration technologies. Digital twin technology enables increased connectivity between organizations, products, and customers.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Porter |first1=Michael |last2=Heppelman |first2=James |title=How smart, connected products are transforming companies |journal=Harvard Business Review |date=October 2015 |volume=93 |pages=96\u2013114 |url=https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-companies}}</ref> For example, connectivity between partners in a supply chain can be increased by enabling members of this supply chain to check the digital twin of a product or asset. These partners can then check the status of this product by simply checking the digital twin.\n\nAlso, connectivity with customers can be increased.\n\nServitization is the process of organizations that are adding value to their core corporate offerings through services.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vandermerwe |first1=Sandra |last2=Rada |first2=Juan |title=Servitization of business: Adding value by adding services |journal=European Management Journal |date=Winter 1988 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=314\u2013324 |doi=10.1016/0263-2373(88)90033-3 }}</ref> In the case of the example of engines, the manufacturing of the engine is the core offering of this organization, they then add value by providing a service of checking the engine and offering maintenance.\n\n=== Homogenization ===\nDigital twins can be further characterized as a digital technology that is both the consequence and an enabler of the homogenization of data. Due to the fact that any type of information or content can now be stored and transmitted in the same digital form, it can be used to create a virtual representation of the product (in the form of a digital twin), thus decoupling the information from its physical form.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tilson |first1=David |last2=Lyytinen |first2=Kalle |last3=S\u00f8rensen |first3=Carsten |title=Digital Infrastructures: The Missing IS Research Agenda |journal=Information Systems Research |date=December 2010 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=748\u2013759 |url=https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5210/h14/pensumliste/articles/tilson-et-al-2010.pdf|doi=10.1287/isre.1100.0318 |jstor=23015642}}</ref> Therefore, the homogenization of data and the decoupling of the information from its physical artifact, have allowed digital twins to come into existence. However, digital twins also enable increasingly more information on physical products to be stored digitally and become decoupled from the product itself.<ref name=Yoo2012>{{cite journal |last1=Yoo |first1=Youngjin |last2=Boland |first2=Richard |last3=Lyytinen |first3=Kalle |last4=Majchrzak |first4=Ann |title=Organizing for innovation in the digitized world. |journal=Organization Science |date=September\u2013October 2012 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=1398\u20131408 |jstor=23252314 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1120.0771 }}</ref>\n\nAs data is increasingly digitized, it can be transmitted, stored and computed in fast and low-cost ways.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> According to [[Moore's law]], computing power will continue to increase exponentially over the coming years, while the cost of computing decreases significantly. This would, therefore, lead to lower marginal costs of developing digital twins and make it comparatively much cheaper to test, predict, and solve problems on virtual representations rather than testing on physical models and waiting for physical products to break before intervening.\n\nAnother consequence of the homogenization and decoupling of information is that the user experience converges. As information from physical objects is digitized, a single artifact can have multiple new affordances.<ref name=\"Yoo2012\" /> Digital twin technology allows detailed information about a physical object to be shared with a larger number of agents, unconstrained by physical location or time.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Grieves |first1=Michael |last2=Vickers |first2=John |title=Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems |journal=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems |date=17 August 2016 |pages=85\u2013113 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4 |isbn=978-3-319-38754-3 }}</ref> In his white paper on digital twin technology in the manufacturing industry, Michael Grieves noted the following about the consequences of homogenization enabled by digital twins:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grieves |first1=Michael |title=Digital twin: manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication. Retrieved from |url=https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/camid/documents/1411.0_Digital_Twin_White_Paper_Dr_Grieves.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|In the past, factory managers had their office overlooking the factory so that they could get a feel for what was happening on the factory floor. With the digital twin, not only the factory manager, but everyone associated with factory production could have that same virtual window to not only a single factory, but to all the factories across the globe. (Grieves, 2014, p.&nbsp;5)}}\n\n=== Reprogrammable and smart ===\nAs stated above, a digital twin enables a physical product to be reprogrammable in a certain way. Furthermore, the digital twin is also reprogrammable in an automatic manner. Through the sensors on the physical product, artificial intelligence technologies, and [[predictive analytics]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Dean |title=Seeing double: why IoT digital twins will change the face of manufacturing |url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3219847/internet-of-things/seeing-double-why-iot-digital-twins-will-change-the-face-of-manufacturing.html |website=Networkworld |accessdate=September 23, 2018|date=2017-08-25 }}</ref> A consequence of this reprogrammable nature is the emergence of functionalities. If we take the example of an engine again, digital twins can be used to collect data about the performance of the engine and if needed adjust the engine, creating a newer version of the product. Also, servitization can be seen as a consequence of the reprogrammable nature as well. Manufactures can be responsible for observing the digital twin, making adjustments, or reprogramming the digital twin when needed and they can offer this as an extra service.\n\n=== Digital traces ===\nAnother characteristic that can be observed, is the fact that digital twin technologies leave digital traces. These traces can be used by engineers for example, when a machine malfunctions to go back and check the traces of the digital twin, to diagnose where the problem occurred.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cai |first1=Yi |title=Sensor Data and Information Fusion to Construct Digital-twins Virtual Machine Tools for Cyber-physical Manufacturing |journal=Procedia Manufacturing |date=2017 |volume=10 |pages=1031\u20131042 |doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.094 |doi-access=free }}</ref> These diagnoses can in the future also be used by the manufacturer of these machines, to improve their designs so that these same malfunctions will occur less often in the future.\n\n=== Modularity ===\nIn the sense of the manufacturing industry, modularity can be described as the design and customization of products and production modules.<ref name=Rosen2015>{{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=Roland |last2=von Wichert |first2=Georg |last3=Lo |first3=George |last4=Bettenhausen |first4=Kurt D. |title=About The Importance of Autonomy and Digital Twins for the Future of Manufacturing |journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine |date=2015 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=567\u2013572 |doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.141 |doi-access=free }}</ref> By adding modularity to the manufacturing models, manufacturers gain the ability to tweak models and machines.

However, by the end of the 12th century the prominence of [[Rus' people|Rus']] began to decline as Kiev's central role became disputed by the surrounding principalities which were increasingly more powerful and independent. Dolgoruki's son [[Andrei I Bogolyubsky]] plundered Kiev in 1169, an event that allowed the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal to take a leading role as the predecessor of the modern Russian state.\n\nThe sacking of Kiev itself in December 1240 during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol Invasion]] led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus' state. For many of its residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kievan [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Chair was moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] by Metropolitan [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]], keeping the titile ''of Kiev''. As Vladimir-Suzdal, and later the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] continued to grow unhindered, the Orthodox religious link between them and Kiev remained strong. Envoys continued to be sent to Moscow from the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. Professional artisans, builders, craftsmen and lay-people also traveled to Moscow where they could more easily earn a living.\n\nThe Southern Ruthenians found themselves within a new state of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. After the union of [[Jogaila]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1386 this state became officially Catholic in leadership. This isolated its majority Orthodox population, and soon many notable Ruthenian leaders began to leave for Moscow. In 1408 a group of nobles led by [[\u0160vitrigaila]] along with the [[Chernihiv]] bishop together with a significant group of soldiers defected to Moscow. Others followed. Trade though initially sporadic, traveling through Chernihiv and [[Putyvl]].\n\nThe frequent [[Russo-Lithuanian Wars]] meant that in 1448, Moscow [[Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Jonah]], despite of the fall of [[Byzantium]], achieved full [[Autocephaly]] for the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The title ''of Kiev'' remained with the Kievan Metropolia, which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nThe emigration to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] continued to grow in the 16th century. Prominent examples include [[Michael Glinski]] who staged a [[Glinski Rebellion|powerful rebellion against Lithuanian rule]] in February 1508 all those that took part in the uprising, who would receive a [[boyar]] title along with villages and lands around [[Medyn]] for settlement. In the mid-16th century the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Ukrainian Hetman]] [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky]] visited Moscow where he served in the court of Tsar [[Ivan IV]] and received in return the city of [[Belyov]] on the river [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and surrounding villages and homesteads as rewards. Trade also grew considerably in this period, and many Ukrainian [[Sloboda]]s were founded in Russian cities.\n\nMany Ukrainian settlers settled in areas that lay between the old [[Zasechnaya cherta]] and the new defence line that would guard Russia from the frequent raids by the [[Nogay Horde|Nogais]] and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]]. This became known as [[Sloboda Ukraine]], and initial forts, such as [[Kursk]], [[Voronezh]] and [[Kharkiv]] were founded and settled by Ukrainian peasants that served the garrisons stationed there. According to the writings of the English trader D. Fletcher in 1588, these garrison towns had 4300 soldiers of which 4000 had come from Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian settlers in the southern borders of Russia increased after the unsuccessful revolts against the Poles. As a result, the bulk of the population became mixed.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, migration to Russia from Ukraine increased. Initially this was to [[Sloboda Ukraine]], but also to the Don lands and the area of the Volga river. There was also a significant migration to [[Moscow]], particularly by church activists: priests and monks, scholars and teachers, artists, translators, singers and merchants. A colony was built in Moscow called the Malorossiysky dvor. In 1652 12 singers under the direction of [[Ternopolsky]] moved to Moscow, 13 graduates of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogilla Collegium]] moved to teach the Moscovite gentry. Many priests and church administrators migrated from Ukraine, in particular the established [[Andreyevsky Monastery]] was made up from Ukrainian clergy. This had a great effect on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the policies of [[Patriarch Nikon]] which led to the [[Old Believers|Old Believer]] [[Raskol]] (schism). The influence of Ukrainian clergy continued to grow, especially after 1686, when the Metropolia of Kiev was transferred from the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] to the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nSoon after, the abolishment of the Patriarch's chair by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], the Ukrainian [[Stephen Yavorsky]] became Metropolitan of Moscow, followed by [[Feofan Prokopovich]]. [[Demetrius of Rostov]] became of Tobol and Siberia, and from 1704 [[Rostov]] and [[Yaroslavl]]. In all over 70 positions in the Orthodox hierarchy were taken by recent emigres from Kiev. Students of the [[Kiev-Mohyla Collegium]] started up schools and seminaries in many Russian eparchies. By 1750, over 125 such institutions were opened. As a result, these graduates practically controlled the Russian church obtaining key posts there (and holding them to almost the end of the 18th century). Under Prokopovich the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] was opened in 1724 which was chaired from 1746 by Ukrainian [[Kirill Razumovsky]].<ref name=Kargamanov>{{cite web|last=Kagramanov|first=Yuri|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/ka10.html|script-title=ru:\u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435|trans-title=The War of Languages in Ukraine|journal=Novy Mir|publisher=magazines.russ.ru|year=2006|issue=8|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Moscow court had a choir established in 1713 with 21 singers from Ukraine. The conductor for a period of time was [[A. Vedel]]. In 1741 44 male, 33 women, and 55 girls were moved to St. Petersburg from Ukraine to sing and entertain. In 1763 the head conductor of the Emperor's court choir was M. Poltoratsky and later [[Dmitry Bortniansky]]. Composer [[Maksym Berezovsky]] also worked in St. Petersburg at the time. A significant Ukrainian presence was also seen in the Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Ukrainian presence in the Russian Army also grew significantly. The greatest influx happened after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. Large numbers of Ukrainians settled around St Petersburg and were employed in the building of the city, the various fortresses and canals.\n\nA separate category of emigrants were those deported to Moscow by the Russian government for demonstrating anti-Russian sentiment. The deported were brought to Moscow initially for investigation, and then exiled to [[Siberia]], [[Arkhangelsk]] or the [[Solovetsky Islands]]. Among the deported were Ukrainian cossack luminaries as D. Mhohohrishny, [[Ivan Samoylovych]] and [[Petro Doroshenko]]. Others include all the family of hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]], A. Vojnarovsky, and those in Mazepa's Cossack forces that returned to Russia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Some were imprisoned in exile for the rest of their lives such as hetman[[Pavlo Polubotok]], [[Pavlo Holovaty]], P.

The promise of free fertile land was an important factor for many peasants who until 1861, lived under [[Serfdom]]. In the colonization of the new lands, a significant contribution was made by ethnic Ukrainians. Initially Ukrainians colonised border territories in the [[Caucasus]]. Most of these settlers came from [[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Slobozhanshchyna]] and mainly settled in the [[Stavropol]], and [[Terek Oblast|Terek]] areas. Some compact areas of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Volga]] and [[Urals]] were also settled.\n\nThe Ukrainians created large settlements within Russia often becoming the majority in certain centres. They continued fostering their traditions, their language and their architecture. Their village structure and administration differed somewhat from the Russian population that surrounded them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kubiyovych (ed) Entsyklopedia Ukrainoznavstva Vol.7, p.2597</ref> Where populations were mixed, russification often took place.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The size and geographical area of the Ukrainian settlements were first seen in the course of the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian Empire Census of 1897]]. This census noted only language, not ethnicity. Nonetheless a total of 22,380,551 Ukrainian speakers were recorded. Within the European territories of Russia 1,020,000 Ukrainians, in Asia (not including the Caucasus) 209,000 were recorded. From 1897-1914, the intense migration of Ukrainians to the Urals and Asia continued, and was measured to be 1.5 million before ceasing in 1915.\n\n===20th century===\n====Formation of Ukrainian borders====\n[[File:Ethnic-Ukrainians.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Ethnographic map of Ukraine, showing ethnographic boundaries of ethnic Ukrainians in the early 20th century.]]\nThe first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897 gave statistics regarding language use in the Russian Empire according to the administrative borders.

These include the territory of [[Sloboda Ukraine|Sloboda]] and the [[Donbass]]. These territories were between Ukraine and Russia. This left a large community of ethnic Ukrainians on the Russian side of the border. The borders of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] were largely preserved by the [[Ukrainian SSR]].\n\nIn the course of the mid-1920s, the course of administrative reforms some territory, initially under the Ukrainian SSR was ceded to the Russian SFSR, such as the [[Taganrog]] and [[Shakhty]] cities in the eastern Donbass. At the time, the Ukrainian SSR gained several territories that were amalgamated into the [[Sumy Oblast]] in Sloboda region.\n\n====Soviet-era migration====\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was officially a multicultural country with no official [[national language]].  On paper all languages and cultures were guaranteed state protection Union-wide.  In reality, however, the Ukrainians were granted the opportunity to meaningfully develop their culture only within the administrative borders of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Republic]], where the Ukrainians had a privileged status of being the [[titular nation]]. As many Ukrainians migrated to other parts of the USSR, the cultural separation often led in their assimilation, particularly within [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], which received the highest percentage of the Ukrainian migration. In [[Siberia]], 82% of Ukrainians entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the Ukrainian SSR, there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. As a result, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian-language press]] was soon found only in large cities such as Moscow. Ukrainian cultural attributes such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to a Soviet sociologist, 27% of the [[Ukrainians in Siberia]] read printed material in Ukrainian and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless, most of the Ukrainians there did assimilate.\n\nDue to the fact that Ukrainians were prominent in the [[Gulags]] of [[Norilsk]] and [[Vorkuta]] Ukrainians have continued to be the majority ethnicity in these cities.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Around 80% of the population in Norilsk in 1989 had least one Ukrainian ancestor.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]] and [[Aleksandr Zhukovsky]] the area of Ukrainian ethnic territory outside of the borders of the Ukrainian SSR (1970) where an ethnic Ukrainian majority lived was estimated to be 146,500 square kilometres, and the area of nationally mixed territories make up approximately 747,600 square kilometres.\n\n==Ukrainian life in post-Soviet Russia==\nThe Ukrainian cultural renaissance in Russia began at the end of the 1980s, with the formation of the [[Slavutych Society]] in Moscow and the Ukrainian Cultural Centre named after T. Shevchenko in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now Saint Petersburg).\n\nIn 1991, the [[Ukraina Society]] organized a conference in [[Kiev]] with delegates from the various new Ukrainian Community organizations of the Eastern Diaspora. By 1991, over 20 such organizations were in existence. By 1992, 600 organizations were registered in Russia alone. The Congress helped to consolidate the efforts of these organizations. From 1992, regional congresses began to take place, organized by the Ukrainian organizations of Prymoria, [[Tyumen Oblast]], Siberia and the Far East. In March 1992, the [[Union of Ukrainian organizations in Moscow]] was founded. In May of that year - The [[Union of Ukrainians in Russia]].\n\nThe term \"Eastern Diaspora\" has been used since 1992 to describe Ukrainians living in the former USSR, as opposed to the [[Western Ukrainian Diaspora]] which was used until then to describe all [[Ukrainian diaspora]] outside the Union. An estimated number of Ukrainians living in the Eastern Diaspora is 6.8 million, and while those in the West is approximately 5 million.\n \nIn February 2009 about 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens were estimated to be working in the Russian Federation, especially in [[Moscow]] and in the construction industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|title=Nearly 3.5 million Ukrainians work in Russia|publisher=unian.info|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=28 September 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227043840/http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|archive-date=27 February 2014}}</ref> According to [[Volodymyr Yelchenko]], the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Russian Federation there were no state schools in Russia with a program for teaching school subjects in the [[Ukrainian language]] as of August 2010; he considered \"the correction of this situation\" as one of his top priority tasks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160657/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78988 Yelchenko wants Ukrainian secondary school to operate in Moscow], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 August 2010)</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, the number of Ukrainian illegal immigrants has been estimated as being between 3\u201311 million. many Ukrainians came illegally so the true number of Russian Ukrainians has been unknown.

However, by the end of the 12th century the prominence of [[Rus' people|Rus']] began to decline as Kiev's central role became disputed by the surrounding principalities which were increasingly more powerful and independent. Dolgoruki's son [[Andrei I Bogolyubsky]] plundered Kiev in 1169, an event that allowed the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal to take a leading role as the predecessor of the modern Russian state.\n\nThe sacking of Kiev itself in December 1240 during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol Invasion]] led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus' state. For many of its residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kievan [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Chair was moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] by Metropolitan [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]], keeping the titile ''of Kiev''. As Vladimir-Suzdal, and later the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] continued to grow unhindered, the Orthodox religious link between them and Kiev remained strong. Envoys continued to be sent to Moscow from the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. Professional artisans, builders, craftsmen and lay-people also traveled to Moscow where they could more easily earn a living.\n\nThe Southern Ruthenians found themselves within a new state of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. After the union of [[Jogaila]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1386 this state became officially Catholic in leadership. This isolated its majority Orthodox population, and soon many notable Ruthenian leaders began to leave for Moscow. In 1408 a group of nobles led by [[\u0160vitrigaila]] along with the [[Chernihiv]] bishop together with a significant group of soldiers defected to Moscow. Others followed. Trade though initially sporadic, traveling through Chernihiv and [[Putyvl]].\n\nThe frequent [[Russo-Lithuanian Wars]] meant that in 1448, Moscow [[Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Jonah]], despite of the fall of [[Byzantium]], achieved full [[Autocephaly]] for the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The title ''of Kiev'' remained with the Kievan Metropolia, which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nThe emigration to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] continued to grow in the 16th century. Prominent examples include [[Michael Glinski]] who staged a [[Glinski Rebellion|powerful rebellion against Lithuanian rule]] in February 1508 all those that took part in the uprising, who would receive a [[boyar]] title along with villages and lands around [[Medyn]] for settlement. In the mid-16th century the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Ukrainian Hetman]] [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky]] visited Moscow where he served in the court of Tsar [[Ivan IV]] and received in return the city of [[Belyov]] on the river [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and surrounding villages and homesteads as rewards. Trade also grew considerably in this period, and many Ukrainian [[Sloboda]]s were founded in Russian cities.\n\nMany Ukrainian settlers settled in areas that lay between the old [[Zasechnaya cherta]] and the new defence line that would guard Russia from the frequent raids by the [[Nogay Horde|Nogais]] and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]]. This became known as [[Sloboda Ukraine]], and initial forts, such as [[Kursk]], [[Voronezh]] and [[Kharkiv]] were founded and settled by Ukrainian peasants that served the garrisons stationed there. According to the writings of the English trader D. Fletcher in 1588, these garrison towns had 4300 soldiers of which 4000 had come from Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian settlers in the southern borders of Russia increased after the unsuccessful revolts against the Poles. As a result, the bulk of the population became mixed.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, migration to Russia from Ukraine increased. Initially this was to [[Sloboda Ukraine]], but also to the Don lands and the area of the Volga river. There was also a significant migration to [[Moscow]], particularly by church activists: priests and monks, scholars and teachers, artists, translators, singers and merchants. A colony was built in Moscow called the Malorossiysky dvor. In 1652 12 singers under the direction of [[Ternopolsky]] moved to Moscow, 13 graduates of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogilla Collegium]] moved to teach the Moscovite gentry. Many priests and church administrators migrated from Ukraine, in particular the established [[Andreyevsky Monastery]] was made up from Ukrainian clergy. This had a great effect on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the policies of [[Patriarch Nikon]] which led to the [[Old Believers|Old Believer]] [[Raskol]] (schism). The influence of Ukrainian clergy continued to grow, especially after 1686, when the Metropolia of Kiev was transferred from the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] to the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nSoon after, the abolishment of the Patriarch's chair by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], the Ukrainian [[Stephen Yavorsky]] became Metropolitan of Moscow, followed by [[Feofan Prokopovich]]. [[Demetrius of Rostov]] became of Tobol and Siberia, and from 1704 [[Rostov]] and [[Yaroslavl]]. In all over 70 positions in the Orthodox hierarchy were taken by recent emigres from Kiev. Students of the [[Kiev-Mohyla Collegium]] started up schools and seminaries in many Russian eparchies. By 1750, over 125 such institutions were opened. As a result, these graduates practically controlled the Russian church obtaining key posts there (and holding them to almost the end of the 18th century). Under Prokopovich the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] was opened in 1724 which was chaired from 1746 by Ukrainian [[Kirill Razumovsky]].<ref name=Kargamanov>{{cite web|last=Kagramanov|first=Yuri|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/ka10.html|script-title=ru:\u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435|trans-title=The War of Languages in Ukraine|journal=Novy Mir|publisher=magazines.russ.ru|year=2006|issue=8|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Moscow court had a choir established in 1713 with 21 singers from Ukraine. The conductor for a period of time was [[A. Vedel]]. In 1741 44 male, 33 women, and 55 girls were moved to St. Petersburg from Ukraine to sing and entertain. In 1763 the head conductor of the Emperor's court choir was M. Poltoratsky and later [[Dmitry Bortniansky]]. Composer [[Maksym Berezovsky]] also worked in St. Petersburg at the time. A significant Ukrainian presence was also seen in the Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Ukrainian presence in the Russian Army also grew significantly. The greatest influx happened after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. Large numbers of Ukrainians settled around St Petersburg and were employed in the building of the city, the various fortresses and canals.\n\nA separate category of emigrants were those deported to Moscow by the Russian government for demonstrating anti-Russian sentiment. The deported were brought to Moscow initially for investigation, and then exiled to [[Siberia]], [[Arkhangelsk]] or the [[Solovetsky Islands]]. Among the deported were Ukrainian cossack luminaries as D. Mhohohrishny, [[Ivan Samoylovych]] and [[Petro Doroshenko]]. Others include all the family of hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]], A. Vojnarovsky, and those in Mazepa's Cossack forces that returned to Russia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Some were imprisoned in exile for the rest of their lives such as hetman[[Pavlo Polubotok]], [[Pavlo Holovaty]], P. Hloba and [[Petro Kalnyshevsky]].\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Russia ethnic.JPG|thumb|175px|Ethnic map of European Russia before the [[First World War]]]]\n[[File:Green Ukraine - Zeleny Klyn - Russian Federation.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Green Ukraine]] - historical Ukrainian name of the land in the Russian Far East area.]]\nBeginning in the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from Belarus, Ukraine and Northern Russia to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire. The promise of free fertile land was an important factor for many peasants who until 1861, lived under [[Serfdom]]. In the colonization of the new lands, a significant contribution was made by ethnic Ukrainians. Initially Ukrainians colonised border territories in the [[Caucasus]]. Most of these settlers came from [[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Slobozhanshchyna]] and mainly settled in the [[Stavropol]], and [[Terek Oblast|Terek]] areas. Some compact areas of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Volga]] and [[Urals]] were also settled.\n\nThe Ukrainians created large settlements within Russia often becoming the majority in certain centres. They continued fostering their traditions, their language and their architecture. Their village structure and administration differed somewhat from the Russian population that surrounded them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kubiyovych (ed) Entsyklopedia Ukrainoznavstva Vol.7, p.2597</ref> Where populations were mixed, russification often took place.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The size and geographical area of the Ukrainian settlements were first seen in the course of the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian Empire Census of 1897]]. This census noted only language, not ethnicity. Nonetheless a total of 22,380,551 Ukrainian speakers were recorded. Within the European territories of Russia 1,020,000 Ukrainians, in Asia (not including the Caucasus) 209,000 were recorded. From 1897-1914, the intense migration of Ukrainians to the Urals and Asia continued, and was measured to be 1.5 million before ceasing in 1915.\n\n===20th century===\n====Formation of Ukrainian borders====\n[[File:Ethnic-Ukrainians.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Ethnographic map of Ukraine, showing ethnographic boundaries of ethnic Ukrainians in the early 20th century.]]\nThe first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897 gave statistics regarding language use in the Russian Empire according to the administrative borders.

These include the territory of [[Sloboda Ukraine|Sloboda]] and the [[Donbass]]. These territories were between Ukraine and Russia. This left a large community of ethnic Ukrainians on the Russian side of the border. The borders of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] were largely preserved by the [[Ukrainian SSR]].\n\nIn the course of the mid-1920s, the course of administrative reforms some territory, initially under the Ukrainian SSR was ceded to the Russian SFSR, such as the [[Taganrog]] and [[Shakhty]] cities in the eastern Donbass. At the time, the Ukrainian SSR gained several territories that were amalgamated into the [[Sumy Oblast]] in Sloboda region.\n\n====Soviet-era migration====\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was officially a multicultural country with no official [[national language]].  On paper all languages and cultures were guaranteed state protection Union-wide.  In reality, however, the Ukrainians were granted the opportunity to meaningfully develop their culture only within the administrative borders of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Republic]], where the Ukrainians had a privileged status of being the [[titular nation]]. As many Ukrainians migrated to other parts of the USSR, the cultural separation often led in their assimilation, particularly within [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], which received the highest percentage of the Ukrainian migration. In [[Siberia]], 82% of Ukrainians entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the Ukrainian SSR, there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. As a result, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian-language press]] was soon found only in large cities such as Moscow. Ukrainian cultural attributes such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to a Soviet sociologist, 27% of the [[Ukrainians in Siberia]] read printed material in Ukrainian and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless, most of the Ukrainians there did assimilate.\n\nDue to the fact that Ukrainians were prominent in the [[Gulags]] of [[Norilsk]] and [[Vorkuta]] Ukrainians have continued to be the majority ethnicity in these cities.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Around 80% of the population in Norilsk in 1989 had least one Ukrainian ancestor.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]] and [[Aleksandr Zhukovsky]] the area of Ukrainian ethnic territory outside of the borders of the Ukrainian SSR (1970) where an ethnic Ukrainian majority lived was estimated to be 146,500 square kilometres, and the area of nationally mixed territories make up approximately 747,600 square kilometres.\n\n==Ukrainian life in post-Soviet Russia==\nThe Ukrainian cultural renaissance in Russia began at the end of the 1980s, with the formation of the [[Slavutych Society]] in Moscow and the Ukrainian Cultural Centre named after T. Shevchenko in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now Saint Petersburg).\n\nIn 1991, the [[Ukraina Society]] organized a conference in [[Kiev]] with delegates from the various new Ukrainian Community organizations of the Eastern Diaspora. By 1991, over 20 such organizations were in existence. By 1992, 600 organizations were registered in Russia alone. The Congress helped to consolidate the efforts of these organizations. From 1992, regional congresses began to take place, organized by the Ukrainian organizations of Prymoria, [[Tyumen Oblast]], Siberia and the Far East. In March 1992, the [[Union of Ukrainian organizations in Moscow]] was founded. In May of that year - The [[Union of Ukrainians in Russia]].\n\nThe term \"Eastern Diaspora\" has been used since 1992 to describe Ukrainians living in the former USSR, as opposed to the [[Western Ukrainian Diaspora]] which was used until then to describe all [[Ukrainian diaspora]] outside the Union. An estimated number of Ukrainians living in the Eastern Diaspora is 6.8 million, and while those in the West is approximately 5 million.\n \nIn February 2009 about 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens were estimated to be working in the Russian Federation, especially in [[Moscow]] and in the construction industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|title=Nearly 3.5 million Ukrainians work in Russia|publisher=unian.info|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=28 September 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227043840/http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|archive-date=27 February 2014}}</ref> According to [[Volodymyr Yelchenko]], the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Russian Federation there were no state schools in Russia with a program for teaching school subjects in the [[Ukrainian language]] as of August 2010; he considered \"the correction of this situation\" as one of his top priority tasks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160657/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78988 Yelchenko wants Ukrainian secondary school to operate in Moscow], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 August 2010)</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, the number of Ukrainian illegal immigrants has been estimated as being between 3\u201311 million. many Ukrainians came illegally so the true number of Russian Ukrainians has been unknown.

All around the city of Omsk stood Ukrainian villages. The settlement of people beyond the Ural mountains began in the 1860s. There were attempts to form an autonomous Ukrainian region in 1917-1920. Altogether before 1914 1,604,873 emigrants from Ukraine settled the area.

In addition to Ukrainians, [[Volga Germans]] and [[Mordovians]] migrated to Zholty Klyn in numbers. {{As of | 2014}} most of the population is mixed in the region, though a few \"pure\" Ukrainian villages remain.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070219091759/http://ukrvolga.seun.ru/ Zhelty Klin website]\n</ref>\n\n[http://www.siryj-klyn.narod.ru/ Siry klyn Ukrainian community portal]\n\n===Norilsk===\n[[Norilsk]] was founded as a series of [[Gulag]] camps that mostly included Ukrainian collaborators with [[Nazi Germany]] who were from the western Ukraine (unlike most other Ukrainians in Russia, who are from the east).\nNorilsk is the only inhabited locality in Russia (excluding villages) with a Ukrainian majority.

Of which, only the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 census]] has been discarded and a semi-fixed 1939 census was carried out.\n\nIn the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, attention has been focused on the Eastern Ukrainian diaspora by the Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. Numerous attempts have been made to unite them.
