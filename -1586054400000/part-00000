It is similar to Gemmell's first book ''[[Legend (Gemmell novel)|Legend]]'' in that Legend arose from Gemmell's own illness with cancer, and ''Wolf in Shadow'' was written while he dealt with his mother's cancer and subsequent death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gemmell|first=David|year=1987|title=Wolf In Shadow|publisher=Random House|location=Chatham, Kent, Great Britain|isbn=0099534703|page=xii}}</ref>\n\n==Trilogy==\n\nInitially written as a stand-alone novel, Gemmell expanded it into a trilogy consisting of the novels:\n# ''Wolf in Shadow'' (1987)\n# ''[[The Last Guardian (novel)|The Last Guardian]]'' (1989)\n# ''Bloodstone'' (1994)\n\n==Setting==\n\n''Wolf in Shadow'' is set in the future, three hundred years after the \"fall\", an apocalyptic event of which little is initially known, but which is regarded in the book as an event akin to Noah's flood in which the world shook out of its orbit tilting it on its axis, which subsequently resulted in the oceans rising and destroying most of human civilization. Several hints are given throughout the novel that this catastrophe might have been due to factors such as pollution and nuclear weapons.\n\nIn addition to this setting the novel employs a magic system based on Sipstrassi or stones of power, which are golden meteors which allow one to heal oneself, create food, and who are supposedly limited only by ones imagination, although each stone only has a certain amount of power, and as they are used black veins will appear upon the stone and grow, until eventually the Sipstrassi is coal black, and powerless. However, by feeding Sipstrassi blood one can refill them, although Sipstrassi refilled in this manner become blood red, incapable of healing or producing feed, good only for combat. Additionally blood Sipstrassi inspire darker feelings such as lust, greed, and rage in their wielders.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nCurrent critical reception of ''Wolf in Shadow'' is largely positive with the book rating Goodreads assigning an average rating of 4.1 with 1291 ratings(as of the 1st of March 2012).
