On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.

The story centers on a mother who struggles with worsening [[bipolar disorder]] and the effects that managing her illness has on her family. The musical addresses [[grief]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], [[drug abuse]], [[Anti-psychiatry#Challenges to psychiatry|ethics in modern psychiatry]], and the underbelly of suburban life.\n\nBefore its [[Off-Broadway]] debut, ''Next to Normal'' received several workshop performances and won the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding New Score and received [[Drama Desk Awards]] nominations for Outstanding Actress ([[Alice Ripley]]) and Outstanding Score. After its [[Off-Broadway]] run, the show played from November 2008 to January 2009 at the [[Arena Stage]] while the theater was in its temporary venue in [[Virginia]].\n\nThe musical opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 2009.

''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', which was also directed by [[Michael Greif]], was the last musical to win the Pulitzer, in 1996.

Loliloloendosnsidixhshsosbxjxjxisisosbx\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\n\nDiana Goodman, a suburban mother suffering from bipolar disorder, stays up late awaiting the return of her son Gabe, who has broken curfew. Also awake is Diana's daughter Natalie, an overachieving high school student who is stressfully studying for an upcoming test. Diana encourages her daughter to take a break and rest, and soon after, Gabe returns home and Diana's husband Dan awakes to help the family prepare for the day (\u201cJust Another Day\u201d). Diana prepares a meal for her family, but Dan and Natalie stop her when they realize the sandwiches she is making cover every surface of the kitchen. As Dan helps the disoriented Diana, Natalie and Gabe leave for school. \nNatalie releases some pent-up anger and frustration as she practices for an upcoming piano recital in the school's music room (\u201cEverything Else\u201d), where she meets Henry, a classmate who has been admiring Natalie from afar. Meanwhile, Diana repeatedly visits her psychiatrist's office where she is prescribed a variety of medications, though they all prove to cause debilitating physical side effects; Dan waits through her appointments in the car while he questions his own sanity (\u201cWho\u2019s Crazy?/ My Psychopharmacologist and I\u201d). When Diana is given a medication which numbs and rids her of all feelings, the doctor pronounces her stable and sends her on her way. \n\nAfter witnessing a romantic moment between Natalie and Henry (\u201cPerfect For You\u201d), Diana mourns the loss of her old life, longing for the days she lived in both pain and joy, as opposed to the numbness her new medication has caused (\u201cI Miss the Mountains\u201d). At Gabe's suggestion, she flushes her medications. \n\nMeanwhile, Dan arranges a family dinner, inviting Henry to join them (\u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Good\u201d). When Diana brings to the table a cake for Gabe's birthday, Dan gently reminds her that Gabe in fact died nearly sixteen years ago, and her visions of him throughout the show have only been hallucinations (\"He's Not Here\"). After an upset Natalie runs to her bedroom, Dan clears off the dinner table while Diana reveals to him she has stopped her medication. As he tries to empathize with her, she becomes angry, saying he could not possibly understand the pain she is going through (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know\u201d). Dan begs her to let him help however he can, reminding her of his faithfulness and patience thus far, but is interrupted by a vision of Gabe, whom only Diana can see. Diana immediately clings to her son, rejecting Dan's offer of comfort (\u201cI Am the One\u201d). Upstairs, Natalie vents to Henry over her mother's attachment to the dead Gabe over her (\u201cSuperboy and the Invisible Girl\u201d). Diana overhears their conversation and offers the only comfort she is capable of giving, telling Natalie, \u201cI love you as much as I can.\u201d  \n\nDiana visits a new doctor, who performs talk therapy and hypnosis on her. During their session, she sees Gabe, who asserts his dominance over her and the control he has in her life (\"I'm Alive\"). Diana reveals intimate details about the effects of her illness, saying that she was unable to hold Natalie in the hospital when she was born. Meanwhile, Natalie botches an important piano recital upon discovering her parents are not in the audience (\u201cMake Up Your Mind/ Catch Me I\u2019m Falling\u201d). Diana's doctor encourages her to go home, spend time with Natalie, and clean out a box of Gabe's old things in an attempt to let him go. Diana agrees but is confronted with a hallucination of Gabe while sorting through a box in their basement (\u201cI Dreamed a Dance\u201d). Gabe convinces her to commit suicide, saying it is the only way they can be together (\u201cThere\u2019s a World\u201d). Diana is hospitalized after her suicide attempt fails, and Dan is told by Dr. Madden that electro-conclusive therapy is one of the only options they have left. Dan returns home to clean up the scene of his wife's attempt at suicide, narrowly avoiding a breakdown of his own as he reminisces about the years spent with Diana (\u201cI\u2019ve Been\u201d). Natalie finds him and is angry to discover that he has agreed to the doctor's recommendation of shock therapy. Upon returning to the hospital, he finds that Diana has become aggressive with the staff for wanting her to sign the confirmation papers, likening the idea of shock therapy to its depiction in the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (\u201cDidn\u2019t I See This Movie?\u201d). However, after clearing the room of doctors, he manages to convince her of the necessity of this treatment, saying it is the only way they can get back to normal (\u201cA Light in the Dark\u201d). Reluctantly, Diana agrees and signs the papers, embracing Dan as the first act comes to a close.\n\n===Act II===\n\nDiana receives a series of ECT treatments over two weeks. Meanwhile, Natalie experiments with drugs and frequently goes clubbing, being rescued most nights by Henry, who sees her home safely. On one occasion, she seems to share a hallucination with her mother (\u201cWish I Were Here\u201d). Upon Diana's return home from the hospital, it is revealed that she has lost her memories of the last nineteen years due to the shock therapy - including the memory of her deceased son (\u201cSong of Forgetting\u201c). Henry, who has been finding Natalie passed out at clubs and driving her home, asks Natalie to the upcoming school dance, an invitation which she immediately declines (\u201cHey #1\u201d). Meanwhile, Dan questions Dr. Madden over Diana's memory loss, learning it is a relatively common side effect of ECT (\u201cSeconds and Years\u201d). Because Gabe's death was the start of a lifetime of depression, Dan hesitates to remind her of it. At home, he and Natalie help Diana sort through a box of pictures and memories of her old life, leaving out any mention of Gabe's existence (\u201cBetter Than Before\u201d). However, Diana is briefly confronted afterward by Gabe, who hints that she has forgotten a vital part of her life (\u201cAftershocks\u201d). Meanwhile, Henry once again invites Natalie to the dance, but is turned down again (\u201cHey #2). \n\nDiana visits Dr. Madden, who accidentally reveals the existence of her son, unaware that Dan has not yet done so (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know (reprise)\u201d). After learning this, Diana returns home and searches through Gabe's old belongings, finding the music box that helped him sleep as an infant.  When Dan finds her revisiting the night their son died, he reluctantly reminds her that their son had died of an illness all of the doctors missed (\u201cHow Could I Ever Forget?\u201d). Diana confusedly admits she recalls hallucinating Gabe as a teenager, and Dan frantically says they will get her to the doctor and do more ECT (\u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Good (reprise)\u201d), which leads to a heated argument between the two that Natalie witnesses the peak of. After Natalie runs upstairs to her bedroom, where Henry is waiting to talk with her, Diana questions Dan as to why he stays, despite all of the things she puts him through and all the pain they have experienced together. He reminds her of their wedding vows and promises to see their relationship through, no matter how much she pushes him away. Upstairs, Henry makes a similar pledge to Natalie (\u201cWhy Stay?/A Promise\u201d). However, Diana once again sees Gabe and is immediately entranced by him, drawn away from Dan (\u201cI\u2019m Alive - Reprise\u201d). \n\nThough Dan begs her to stay, Diana leaves and visits Dr. Madden, frustrated that years of treatment haven't seemed to improve her condition and wonders if her grief over losing her son should truly be medicated (\u201cThe Break\u201d). Dr. Madden pleads with her to stay with him, recommending more shock treatment and other medications, but she leaves the appointment (\u201cMake Up Your Mind/Catch Me I\u2019m Falling (reprise)\u201d). Upon returning outside, she connects with Natalie for the first time, noting the similarities between the two of them and truly making an effort to connect with her for possibly the first time. They embrace and agree that somehow they will get by, and Diana drives Natalie to the dance to meet Henry (\u201cMaybe\u201d). At the dance, Natalie voices her concerns to Henry that she will someday end up with the same issues as her mother, though Henry promises to stand by her no matter what, and the two kiss (\u201cHey #3/ Perfect For You (reprise)\u201d).\n\nDiana returns home and tells Dan she is leaving him, saying that though she still loves him, they both must finally come to terms with their grief on their own (\u201cSo Anyway\u201d). Devastated, Dan looks back on his years of faithfulness to her and sees Gabe for the first time. (\u201cI Am the One (reprise)\u201d). The two share an embrace, and Dan says his name for the first time in the course of the show. Gabe disappears, and Natalie returns home to find that her mother is gone. She continues her relationship with Henry, and Diana has moved in with her parents temporarily, still depressed but more hopeful than she's ever been. Dan visits Dr. Madden, who gives him the name of another psychiatrist he can talk to. Gabe is seen by the audience one final time, this time relaying a message of hope as opposed to the threatening, ominous persona he has taken most of the show, and the family adjusts to their new way of life (\u201cLight\u201d).\n\n==Characters==\n''Note: These descriptions come from the Characters section in the script.'' \n* Diana: \"Sexy.

Such drugs include [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], a mood stabilizer, [[Lorazepam|Ativan]] and [[Diazepam|Valium]], benzodiazepines, all of which are mentioned in the lyrics, particularly in the song \"My Psychopharmacologist and I\", in which Diana is prescribed a plethora of different drugs at once, which are mentioned alongside their side-effects, ranging from drowsiness to [[sexual dysfunction]]. Another form of treatment the play explores is [[psychotherapy]], where patients talk to psychologists or other licensed mental health professionals and aim to work through the psychological component of their disease through conversation; Diana's psychiatrist leads her through a [[guided meditation]] or [[hypnotherapy|hypnotherapeutic]] approach. The third form addressed is [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)]] in which seizures are induced by sending an electric current through the brain. Following a suicide attempt, Diana is convinced to undergo ECT and then loses her memory (including her memory of Gabe), which she slowly gains back in talks with her family. ECT is often viewed as a last-resort option for depressed patients who are incredibly ill and extremely treatment-resistant or whose symptoms include very serious suicidal or psychotic symptoms, or for pregnant women.<ref>Hirschfeld, Robert, et al. Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder Second Edition. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2002. Print.</ref> This practice holds true in the play, in which ECT is only recommended after Diana's hallucination of Gabe suggests that she kill herself in the song \"There's a World\".\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Development===\nThe musical began in 1998 as a 10-minute workshop sketch about a woman undergoing electroshock therapy, and its impact on her family, called ''Feeling Electric''.  Yorkey brought the idea to Kitt while both were at the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.  Kitt wrote a rock score for the short piece, which was highly critical of the medical treatment.  Both Yorkey and Kitt turned to other projects, but they \"kept returning to ''Feeling Electric''\", eventually expanding it to a full-length musical.<ref name=Columbia>Getlin, Josh.  \"The Ballad of Kitt &Yorkey\", ''Columbia Magazine'', [[Columbia University]], Fall 2010, pp. 22\u201323</ref>  This had a reading in 2002 at the [[Village Theatre]] in [[Issaquah, Washington]], then at several venues in New York City,<ref name=Columbia/> with a cast that included [[Norbert Leo Butz]] as Dan, [[Sherie Rene Scott]] as Diana, Benjamin Schrader as Gabe, Anya Singleton as Natalie and Greg Naughton as Dr. Madden.

Kyle Dean Massey said, \"I read about a page a night.\" Salinger's novel about grieving a loss is read by the character who ''is'' the loss.  In ''Catcher'', Holden struggles with the loss of a brother, Allie, who died of leukemia.\n*When sorting through a box of items from her son's room, Diana picks up a music box from the box to reveal a copy of ''[[Goodnight Moon]]'' underneath.\n*Natalie carries a hardcover copy of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', which she is studying in school. Both the novel and \"Next to Normal\" deal with psychological experimentation.\n*Diana alludes to ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Sylvia Plath]], and [[Frances Farmer]] in the song \"Didn't I See This Movie?\".\n*Diana also reads from ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', a play by [[Edward Albee]] which deals with marital stress caused by issues similar to some in \"Next to Normal\". On her YouTube site, Alice Ripley said that she uses Albee's play as a Bible, drawing inspiration for Diana.\n\n==Pulitzer Prize controversy==\n''Next to Normal'' won the 2010 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] although it was not on the shortlist of three candidates submitted to the twenty-member Pulitzer Prize board by the five-member Drama jury.

The story centers on a mother who struggles with worsening [[bipolar disorder]] and the effects that managing her illness has on her family. The musical addresses [[grief]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], [[drug abuse]], [[Anti-psychiatry#Challenges to psychiatry|ethics in modern psychiatry]], and the underbelly of suburban life.\n\nBefore its [[Off-Broadway]] debut, ''Next to Normal'' received several workshop performances and won the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding New Score and received [[Drama Desk Awards]] nominations for Outstanding Actress ([[Alice Ripley]]) and Outstanding Score. After its [[Off-Broadway]] run, the show played from November 2008 to January 2009 at the [[Arena Stage]] while the theater was in its temporary venue in [[Virginia]].\n\nThe musical opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 2009. It was nominated for eleven [[2009 Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] that year and won three: [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Tony Award for Best Orchestrations|Best Orchestration]], and [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] for Alice Ripley. It also won the 2010 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], becoming the eighth musical in history to receive the honor. ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', which was also directed by [[Michael Greif]], was the last musical to win the Pulitzer, in 1996. In awarding the prize to Kitt and Yorkey, the Pulitzer Board called the show \"a powerful rock musical that grapples with mental illness in a suburban family and expands the scope of subject matter for musicals.\"<ref>Hetrick, Adam.

The Broadway production closed on January 16, 2011 after 20 previews and 734 regular performances. There have been numerous international productions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\n\nDiana Goodman, a suburban mother suffering from bipolar disorder, stays up late awaiting the return of her son Gabe, who has broken curfew. Also awake is Diana's daughter Natalie, an overachieving high school student who is stressfully studying for an upcoming test. Diana encourages her daughter to take a break and rest, and soon after, Gabe returns home and Diana's husband Dan awakes to help the family prepare for the day (\u201cJust Another Day\u201d). Diana prepares a meal for her family, but Dan and Natalie stop her when they realize the sandwiches she is making cover every surface of the kitchen. As Dan helps the disoriented Diana, Natalie and Gabe leave for school. \nNatalie releases some pent-up anger and frustration as she practices for an upcoming piano recital in the school's music room (\u201cEverything Else\u201d), where she meets Henry, a classmate who has been admiring Natalie from afar. Meanwhile, Diana repeatedly visits her psychiatrist's office where she is prescribed a variety of medications, though they all prove to cause debilitating physical side effects; Dan waits through her appointments in the car while he questions his own sanity (\u201cWho\u2019s Crazy?/ My Psychopharmacologist and I\u201d). When Diana is given a medication which numbs and rids her of all feelings, the doctor pronounces her stable and sends her on her way. \n\nAfter witnessing a romantic moment between Natalie and Henry (\u201cPerfect For You\u201d), Diana mourns the loss of her old life, longing for the days she lived in both pain and joy, as opposed to the numbness her new medication has caused (\u201cI Miss the Mountains\u201d). At Gabe's suggestion, she flushes her medications. \n\nMeanwhile, Dan arranges a family dinner, inviting Henry to join them (\u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Good\u201d). When Diana brings to the table a cake for Gabe's birthday, Dan gently reminds her that Gabe in fact died nearly sixteen years ago, and her visions of him throughout the show have only been hallucinations (\"He's Not Here\"). After an upset Natalie runs to her bedroom, Dan clears off the dinner table while Diana reveals to him she has stopped her medication. As he tries to empathize with her, she becomes angry, saying he could not possibly understand the pain she is going through (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know\u201d). Dan begs her to let him help however he can, reminding her of his faithfulness and patience thus far, but is interrupted by a vision of Gabe, whom only Diana can see. Diana immediately clings to her son, rejecting Dan's offer of comfort (\u201cI Am the One\u201d). Upstairs, Natalie vents to Henry over her mother's attachment to the dead Gabe over her (\u201cSuperboy and the Invisible Girl\u201d). Diana overhears their conversation and offers the only comfort she is capable of giving, telling Natalie, \u201cI love you as much as I can.\u201d  \n\nDiana visits a new doctor, who performs talk therapy and hypnosis on her. During their session, she sees Gabe, who asserts his dominance over her and the control he has in her life (\"I'm Alive\"). Diana reveals intimate details about the effects of her illness, saying that she was unable to hold Natalie in the hospital when she was born. Meanwhile, Natalie botches an important piano recital upon discovering her parents are not in the audience (\u201cMake Up Your Mind/ Catch Me I\u2019m Falling\u201d). Diana's doctor encourages her to go home, spend time with Natalie, and clean out a box of Gabe's old things in an attempt to let him go. Diana agrees but is confronted with a hallucination of Gabe while sorting through a box in their basement (\u201cI Dreamed a Dance\u201d). Gabe convinces her to commit suicide, saying it is the only way they can be together (\u201cThere\u2019s a World\u201d). Diana is hospitalized after her suicide attempt fails, and Dan is told by Dr. Madden that electro-conclusive therapy is one of the only options they have left. Dan returns home to clean up the scene of his wife's attempt at suicide, narrowly avoiding a breakdown of his own as he reminisces about the years spent with Diana (\u201cI\u2019ve Been\u201d). Natalie finds him and is angry to discover that he has agreed to the doctor's recommendation of shock therapy. Upon returning to the hospital, he finds that Diana has become aggressive with the staff for wanting her to sign the confirmation papers, likening the idea of shock therapy to its depiction in the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (\u201cDidn\u2019t I See This Movie?\u201d). However, after clearing the room of doctors, he manages to convince her of the necessity of this treatment, saying it is the only way they can get back to normal (\u201cA Light in the Dark\u201d). Reluctantly, Diana agrees and signs the papers, embracing Dan as the first act comes to a close.\n\n===Act II===\n\nDiana receives a series of ECT treatments over two weeks. Meanwhile, Natalie experiments with drugs and frequently goes clubbing, being rescued most nights by Henry, who sees her home safely. On one occasion, she seems to share a hallucination with her mother (\u201cWish I Were Here\u201d). Upon Diana's return home from the hospital, it is revealed that she has lost her memories of the last nineteen years due to the shock therapy - including the memory of her deceased son (\u201cSong of Forgetting\u201c). Henry, who has been finding Natalie passed out at clubs and driving her home, asks Natalie to the upcoming school dance, an invitation which she immediately declines (\u201cHey #1\u201d). Meanwhile, Dan questions Dr. Madden over Diana's memory loss, learning it is a relatively common side effect of ECT (\u201cSeconds and Years\u201d). Because Gabe's death was the start of a lifetime of depression, Dan hesitates to remind her of it. At home, he and Natalie help Diana sort through a box of pictures and memories of her old life, leaving out any mention of Gabe's existence (\u201cBetter Than Before\u201d). However, Diana is briefly confronted afterward by Gabe, who hints that she has forgotten a vital part of her life (\u201cAftershocks\u201d). Meanwhile, Henry once again invites Natalie to the dance, but is turned down again (\u201cHey #2). \n\nDiana visits Dr. Madden, who accidentally reveals the existence of her son, unaware that Dan has not yet done so (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know (reprise)\u201d). After learning this, Diana returns home and searches through Gabe's old belongings, finding the music box that helped him sleep as an infant.  When Dan finds her revisiting the night their son died, he reluctantly reminds her that their son had died of an illness all of the doctors missed (\u201cHow Could I Ever Forget?\u201d). Diana confusedly admits she recalls hallucinating Gabe as a teenager, and Dan frantically says they will get her to the doctor and do more ECT (\u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Good (reprise)\u201d), which leads to a heated argument between the two that Natalie witnesses the peak of. After Natalie runs upstairs to her bedroom, where Henry is waiting to talk with her, Diana questions Dan as to why he stays, despite all of the things she puts him through and all the pain they have experienced together. He reminds her of their wedding vows and promises to see their relationship through, no matter how much she pushes him away. Upstairs, Henry makes a similar pledge to Natalie (\u201cWhy Stay?/A Promise\u201d). However, Diana once again sees Gabe and is immediately entranced by him, drawn away from Dan (\u201cI\u2019m Alive - Reprise\u201d). \n\nThough Dan begs her to stay, Diana leaves and visits Dr. Madden, frustrated that years of treatment haven't seemed to improve her condition and wonders if her grief over losing her son should truly be medicated (\u201cThe Break\u201d). Dr. Madden pleads with her to stay with him, recommending more shock treatment and other medications, but she leaves the appointment (\u201cMake Up Your Mind/Catch Me I\u2019m Falling (reprise)\u201d). Upon returning outside, she connects with Natalie for the first time, noting the similarities between the two of them and truly making an effort to connect with her for possibly the first time. They embrace and agree that somehow they will get by, and Diana drives Natalie to the dance to meet Henry (\u201cMaybe\u201d). At the dance, Natalie voices her concerns to Henry that she will someday end up with the same issues as her mother, though Henry promises to stand by her no matter what, and the two kiss (\u201cHey #3/ Perfect For You (reprise)\u201d).\n\nDiana returns home and tells Dan she is leaving him, saying that though she still loves him, they both must finally come to terms with their grief on their own (\u201cSo Anyway\u201d). Devastated, Dan looks back on his years of faithfulness to her and sees Gabe for the first time. (\u201cI Am the One (reprise)\u201d). The two share an embrace, and Dan says his name for the first time in the course of the show. Gabe disappears, and Natalie returns home to find that her mother is gone. She continues her relationship with Henry, and Diana has moved in with her parents temporarily, still depressed but more hopeful than she's ever been. Dan visits Dr. Madden, who gives him the name of another psychiatrist he can talk to. Gabe is seen by the audience one final time, this time relaying a message of hope as opposed to the threatening, ominous persona he has taken most of the show, and the family adjusts to their new way of life (\u201cLight\u201d).\n\n==Characters==\n''Note: These descriptions come from the Characters section in the script.'' \n* Diana: \"Sexy.

In the show, Diana's doctor describes her as a \"bipolar depressive with delusional episodes\",<ref name=\"Tom Kitt 2009\">Music by Tom Kitt, & Book and Lyrics by Brian Yorkey. (2009). ''Next to normal [Feeling Electric]''. New York, NY: Musical Theatre International.</ref> however, the most recent edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) would now diagnose Diana as bipolar \"with [[Psychosis|psychotic features]]\",<ref>Glass, Guy. (2015). \"[http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/view/16093 Next to Normal]\". ''NYU Langone Health''.</ref> referring to the [[hallucination]]s she experiences, such as of her dead son Gabe in the form of a teenager. The disorder is also now separated into bipolar types I and II.\n\n===Treatment===\n{{main|Treatment of bipolar disorder}}\n[[Bipolar disorder]] is a disease of both [[mania]] (or [[hypomania]]) and depression that is not curable, mostly treated through psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and biological means. First, are the [[Psychopharmacology|psychopharmacological therapies]], commonly known as [[Pharmacotherapy|drug therapies]], which involves the use of [[antipsychotic]], [[anticonvulsant]], and [[antidepressant]] medications, that aim to stabilize the patient's mood. Such drugs include [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], a mood stabilizer, [[Lorazepam|Ativan]] and [[Diazepam|Valium]], benzodiazepines, all of which are mentioned in the lyrics, particularly in the song \"My Psychopharmacologist and I\", in which Diana is prescribed a plethora of different drugs at once, which are mentioned alongside their side-effects, ranging from drowsiness to [[sexual dysfunction]]. Another form of treatment the play explores is [[psychotherapy]], where patients talk to psychologists or other licensed mental health professionals and aim to work through the psychological component of their disease through conversation; Diana's psychiatrist leads her through a [[guided meditation]] or [[hypnotherapy|hypnotherapeutic]] approach. The third form addressed is [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)]] in which seizures are induced by sending an electric current through the brain. Following a suicide attempt, Diana is convinced to undergo ECT and then loses her memory (including her memory of Gabe), which she slowly gains back in talks with her family. ECT is often viewed as a last-resort option for depressed patients who are incredibly ill and extremely treatment-resistant or whose symptoms include very serious suicidal or psychotic symptoms, or for pregnant women.<ref>Hirschfeld, Robert, et al. Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder Second Edition. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2002. Print.</ref> This practice holds true in the play, in which ECT is only recommended after Diana's hallucination of Gabe suggests that she kill herself in the song \"There's a World\".\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Development===\nThe musical began in 1998 as a 10-minute workshop sketch about a woman undergoing electroshock therapy, and its impact on her family, called ''Feeling Electric''.  Yorkey brought the idea to Kitt while both were at the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.  Kitt wrote a rock score for the short piece, which was highly critical of the medical treatment.  Both Yorkey and Kitt turned to other projects, but they \"kept returning to ''Feeling Electric''\", eventually expanding it to a full-length musical.<ref name=Columbia>Getlin, Josh.  \"The Ballad of Kitt &Yorkey\", ''Columbia Magazine'', [[Columbia University]], Fall 2010, pp. 22\u201323</ref>  This had a reading in 2002 at the [[Village Theatre]] in [[Issaquah, Washington]], then at several venues in New York City,<ref name=Columbia/> with a cast that included [[Norbert Leo Butz]] as Dan, [[Sherie Rene Scott]] as Diana, Benjamin Schrader as Gabe, Anya Singleton as Natalie and Greg Naughton as Dr. Madden.

Its first home video release came in 2004 with the release of the [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Three|third wave of the Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD sets.\n\n==Plot==\nA German oom-pah band\u2014composed of Axis leaders [[Joseph Goebbels]] on the trombone, [[Heinrich Himmler]] on the snare drum, [[Hideki Tojo]] on the sousaphone, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] on the piccolo and [[Benito Mussolini]] on the bass drum\u2014marches noisily at four o'clock in the morning through a small town where the trees, windmills, fence posts, and even the clouds are shaped like [[swastika]]s, singing the virtues of the Nazi doctrine. As they near Donald Duck's house, Donald is heiling to the song in his sleep. His alarm clock, with all the numbers replaced with swastikas, goes off and he smashes it. His cuckoo clock with a bird that is dressed up as Hitler heils as a clock chime, only for Donald to throw a shoe at it. Passing by Donald Duck's house (the features of which depict Adolf Hitler), the band members poke him out of bed with a bayonet to get him ready for work. Here Donald then faces and \"Heils\" the portraits of the F\u00fchrer (Hitler), the Emperor ([[Hirohito]]) and Il Duce (Mussolini) respectively, then goes to make breakfast.\n\nBecause of wartime rationing, Donald's breakfast consists of bread that is so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be sliced using a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and a bacon and egg-flavored breath spray. The band shoves a copy of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and G\u00f6ring kicking him.\n[[Image:Ducknazi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Donald salutes the F\u00fchrer]]\n\nUpon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his comical 48-hour daily shift of screwing caps onto artillery shells coming at him in an assembly line. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of the F\u00fchrer, so Donald must perform the Hitler salute every time a portrait appears, all the while screwing the caps onto shells, much to his disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells as large as Donald (if not larger). The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the [[Charlie Chaplin]] comedy ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. At the same time, he is bombarded with propaganda messages about the purported superiority of the Aryan race and the glory of working for the F\u00fchrer.\n\nAfter a \"paid vacation\" that consists of making swastika shapes with his body for a few seconds in front of a painted backdrop of the Alps as exercise, Donald is ordered to work overtime. He has a nervous breakdown with hallucinations of artillery shells everywhere, some of which are snakes and birds, some sing and are the same shape of the marching band from the start, music and all (some of the animation from this sequence is recycled from the \"[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]\" sequence from ''[[Dumbo]]'').\n\nWhen the hallucinations clear, Donald finds himself in his bed, and realizes that the whole experience was a nightmare; however, he sees the shadow of a figure holding its right hand up in the form of a Nazi salute. He begins to do so himself until he realizes that it is the shadow of a miniature Statue of Liberty, holding her torch high in her right hand. Remembering he is in the United States, Donald embraces the statue, saying \"Am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America!\"\n\nThe short ends with a caricature of Hitler's angry face, and a tomato is thrown at it, forming the words '''''The End'''''.\n\n==Song==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Der Fuehrer's Face\n| cover      = Derfuehrersfaceposter.JPG\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers\n| album      =\n| released   =\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1942\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      =\n| writer     = [[Oliver Wallace]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nBefore the film's release, the popular band [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers, noted for their parodies of popular songs of the time, released a version of [[Oliver Wallace]]'s theme song, \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (also known informally as \"The Nazi Song\") in September 1942 on [[RCA Victor]] [[Bluebird Records]] #11586.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Week's Best Releases |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT62#v=onepage&q=%22Der%20Fuehrer's%20Face%22 |newspaper=Billboard |location= |publisher= |page=66 |date=September 26, 1942 |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> The song parodied the Nazi anthem, the \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied|Horst Wessel Song]]\".

During the 1880s, they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne. Investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne.<ref name=Tilles2014/> During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) fully accounted for the disease in its entirety.<ref name=Tilles2014/> This led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.<ref name=Tilles2014/>\n\nThe approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century.

This was a windfall for amateur radio enthusiasts, allowing access to fairly inexpensive radios which could easily be modified for use in the 10-meter band.\n\nAmerican Novice- and Technician-class licensees were granted [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] segments on the 10-meter band as of 0001 UTC March 21, 1987.<ref>''FCC Report And Order 87-36'', Adopted: January 28, 1987; Released: February 10, 1987. Reprinted in \"Novice Enhancement is A Reality!\", ''Happenings'', ''QST'' Magazine, April 1987, pp. 64-67.</ref>\n\nWith the elimination of [[Morse code]] testing requirements for U.S. amateurs in February 2007, Technician-class licensees who have not passed a code test may operate with up to 200 watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]] using [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] modes in a portion of the 10-meter band.\n\n== Operating ==\n[[Image:10 Meter 2Way Radio.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Uniden President HR2510A, a mobile 10-meter radio.]]\nBeing a very wide band in HF terms, many different transmission modes can be found on 10 meters. [[Morse code]] and other [[narrowband]] modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] from 28.300&nbsp;MHz up, and [[wideband]] modes ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency Modulation|FM]]) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as [[PSK-31]], are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\n== Propagation characteristics ==\n{{See also|Radio propagation}}\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth. Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\n=== Worldwide frequency allocations ===\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/hfband.htm |title=Amateur HF Bands |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700&nbsp;MHz.\n\n=== IARU Region 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 35px | 28.190-28.225\n! width= 400px | 28.225-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 1\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 2 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 10px | 28.190-28.300\n! width= 400px | 28.300-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 2\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #E8AFF5\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 3 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 50px | 28.000-28.050\n! width= 100px | 28.050-28.150\n! width= 40px | 28.150-28.190\n! width= 20px | 28.190-28.200\n! width= 100px | 28.200-28.300\n! width= 400px | 28.300-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 3\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n===USA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:70%\"\n! width=120px | 10 Meters\n! width=150px | 28000 \u2013 28300\n! width=100px | 28300 \u2013 28500\n! width=600px | 28500 \u2013 29700\n|-\n| Novice / Technician\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n|\n|-\n| General, Advanced, Extra\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n|}\n\n=== Canada 10 meter band plan ===\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan.

The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range.

Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band.

This was a windfall for amateur radio enthusiasts, allowing access to fairly inexpensive radios which could easily be modified for use in the 10-meter band.\n\nAmerican Novice- and Technician-class licensees were granted [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] segments on the 10-meter band as of 0001 UTC March 21, 1987.<ref>''FCC Report And Order 87-36'', Adopted: January 28, 1987; Released: February 10, 1987. Reprinted in \"Novice Enhancement is A Reality!\", ''Happenings'', ''QST'' Magazine, April 1987, pp. 64-67.</ref>\n\nWith the elimination of [[Morse code]] testing requirements for U.S. amateurs in February 2007, Technician-class licensees who have not passed a code test may operate with up to 200 watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]] using [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] modes in a portion of the 10-meter band.\n\n== Operating ==\n[[Image:10 Meter 2Way Radio.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Uniden President HR2510A, a mobile 10-meter radio.]]\nBeing a very wide band in HF terms, many different transmission modes can be found on 10 meters. [[Morse code]] and other [[narrowband]] modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] from 28.300&nbsp;MHz up, and [[wideband]] modes ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency Modulation|FM]]) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as [[PSK-31]], are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\n== Propagation characteristics ==\n{{See also|Radio propagation}}\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth. Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\n=== Worldwide frequency allocations ===\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/hfband.htm |title=Amateur HF Bands |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700&nbsp;MHz.\n\n=== IARU Region 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 35px | 28.190-28.225\n! width= 400px | 28.225-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 1\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 2 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 10px | 28.190-28.300\n! width= 400px | 28.300-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 2\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #E8AFF5\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 3 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 50px | 28000-28050\n! width= 100px | 28050-28150\n! width= 40px | 28150-28190\n! width= 20px | 28190-28200\n! width= 100px | 28200-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 3\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n===USA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:70%\"\n! width=120px | 10 Meters\n! width=150px | 28000 \u2013 28300\n! width=100px | 28300 \u2013 28500\n! width=600px | 28500 \u2013 29700\n|-\n| Novice / Technician\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n|\n|-\n| General, Advanced, Extra\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n|}\n\n=== Canada 10 meter band plan ===\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan.

Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band. The major group of enthusiasts is Ten-Ten which has been organized since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ten-ten.org/ |title=10-10 International |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=FCCTable>\n{{cite web\n|url         = http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf\n|title       = FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations\n|date        = June 2, 2011\n|work        = 47 C.F.R.\n|publisher   = Federal Communications Commission\n|format      = PDF\n|accessdate  = 28 May 2013\n|quote       = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{AmateurRadioBands-MFHF}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:10-meter Band}}\n\n[[Category:Amateur radio bands]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIARU Region 3", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-meter_band"}
