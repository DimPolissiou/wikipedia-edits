It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 13, 2016, and was released on September 13, 2016. It was succeeded by [[iOS 11]] on September 19, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 11 With Revamped Lock Screen, Fresh App Store, New Siri Voice, and Updated iPad Interface |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 19, 2017 |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\niOS 10 incorporates changes to [[3D Touch]] and the lock screen. There are new features to some apps: [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] has additional [[emoji]]s and third-party apps can extend functionality in iMessage, [[Apple Maps|Maps]] has a redesigned interface and additional third-party functions, the Home app manages \"HomeKit\"-enabled accessories, [[Photos (Apple)|Photos]] has algorithmic search and categorization of media known as \"Memories\", and [[Siri]] is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending [[instant messaging|IM]]s, using [[Lyft]] or [[Uber]] or to use payment functions.\n\nReviews of iOS 10 were positive. Reviewers highlighted the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was \"becoming a platform\", although the user interface was criticized for being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was \"great\", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting it was still a \"work in progress\" with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch \"finally feels useful\" and \"works in almost every part of the OS\". The lock screen was \"far more customizable than before\", and reviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.\n\nA month after release, iOS 10 was installed on 54% of iOS devices, a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9, speculated as being caused by an early release issue that may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\".

He wrote that iMessage is \"becoming a platform all its own\", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of \"third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place\" is a \"nightmare\", although finishing with \"Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call.\" Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it \"great\", while noting the limited class of apps (\"calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts\"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing \"Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember\". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was \"impressed\" by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to [[Google Photos]] as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were \"for the better\". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included \"deletable\" apps, upgraded \"widgets\" when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as \"Still a walled garden, but with more doors\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=iOS 10 review: doors into the walled garden |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13010546/apple-ios-10-review-imessage-music-siri-iphone-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Engadget]]''{{'}}s Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS 10 is Apple \"basically polishing a pearl\". Hardawar noted that the major changes in the release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now \"far more customizable than before\". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it \"finally feels useful\", where he likes that \"3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS\". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are \"particularly useful\", including \"Invisible ink\" that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it \"needs some work\". The \"Memories\" feature in the new Photos app \"usually turned out well\", but wrote that \"they're still clearly a work in progress\". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that \"really, anything is better than the last iteration\". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was \"actually starting to get useful\", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] before, the mobile industry is \"shamelessly getting \"inspired\" by the competition\". His summary states that \"iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar |title=iOS 10 review: Apple evolves |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/16/ios-10-review/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 16, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, a month after its initial release, 54% of iOS devices were running iOS 10,<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=According to Apple's official figures, iOS 10 adoption rate now at 54% |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/according-to-apples-official-figures-ios-10-adoption-rate-now-at-54/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9 in the preceding year, a result speculated by ''[[MacRumors]]''{{'}}s Tim Hardwick as being caused by an early release issue that disabled some devices and may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple Puts Official iOS 10 Adoption Rate Figure at 54% |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/11/apple-ios-10-adoption-rate-figure-at-54/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> User adoption increased to 76% of active devices in January 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on 76% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/05/ios-10-installed-on-76-percent-of-ios-devices/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> 79% in February 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on Nearly 80% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/22/ios-10-nearly-80-percent-adoption/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=February 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> 86% in June 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple introduces iOS 11 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 5, 2017}}</ref> 87% in July 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Chokkattu |title=About 87 percent of active Apple iPhone and iPad devices run iOS 10 |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-distribution-news/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=August 21, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref> and 89% in September 2017 before the release of [[iOS 11]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sebastien |last=Page |title=iOS 10 adoption reaches 89% ahead of iOS 11 launch |url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/10/ios-10-adoption-reaches-89-ahead-of-ios-11-launch/ |website=iDownloadBlog |date=September 10, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Problems ==\n\n=== Initial release bricking issue ===\nThe initial public release of iOS 10 on September 13, 2016 saw many [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s temporarily disabled, or \"bricked\", by the over-the-air update, requiring bricked devices to be connected to a [[Macintosh|Mac]] or [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] with [[iTunes]] in order to retry the update or restore the device to factory settings.

Reviewers highlighted the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was \"becoming a platform\", although the user interface was criticized for being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was \"great\", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting it was still a \"work in progress\" with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch \"finally feels useful\" and \"works in almost every part of the OS\". The lock screen was \"far more customizable than before\", and reviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.\n\nA month after release, iOS 10 was installed on 54% of iOS devices, a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9, speculated as being caused by an early release issue that may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\". User adoption of iOS 10 steadily increased in the following months, eventually totaling 89% of active devices in September 2017.\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 10}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release ===\niOS 10 was introduced at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] keynote address on June 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vlad |last=Savov |title=Apple announces iOS 10 with 10 major features and redesigns |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11921068/apple-ios-10-announced-new-iphone-features-wwdc-2016 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> The first beta release was made available to registered developers following the keynote.<ref>{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Epstein |title=iOS 10 beta 1 is now available for download! |url=http://bgr.com/2016/06/13/ios-10-beta-1-download-link-how-to/ |website=[[Boy Genius Report|BGR]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> Apple released the first public beta release on July 7, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Slivka |title=Public Beta of iOS 10 Now Available for Download |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/07/07/ios-10-public-beta/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=July 7, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\niOS 10 was officially released on September 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10 With Redesigned Lock Screen, New Messages Features, Third-Party Siri, and More |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Updates ===\n\n==== 10.0.1 ====\niOS 10.0.1 was released on September 13, 2016, as the first update to iOS 10.

He wrote that iMessage is \"becoming a platform all its own\", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of \"third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place\" is a \"nightmare\", although finishing with \"Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call.\" Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it \"great\", while noting the limited class of apps (\"calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts\"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing \"Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember\". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was \"impressed\" by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to [[Google Photos]] as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were \"for the better\". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included \"deletable\" apps, upgraded \"widgets\" when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as \"Still a walled garden, but with more doors\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=iOS 10 review: doors into the walled garden |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13010546/apple-ios-10-review-imessage-music-siri-iphone-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Engadget]]''{{'}}s Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS 10 is Apple \"basically polishing a pearl\". Hardawar noted that the major changes in the release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now \"far more customizable than before\". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it \"finally feels useful\", where he likes that \"3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS\". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are \"particularly useful\", including \"Invisible ink\" that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it \"needs some work\". The \"Memories\" feature in the new Photos app \"usually turned out well\", but wrote that \"they're still clearly a work in progress\". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that \"really, anything is better than the last iteration\". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was \"actually starting to get useful\", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] before, the mobile industry is \"shamelessly getting \"inspired\" by the competition\". His summary states that \"iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar |title=iOS 10 review: Apple evolves |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/16/ios-10-review/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 16, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, a month after its initial release, 54% of iOS devices were running iOS 10,<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=According to Apple's official figures, iOS 10 adoption rate now at 54% |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/according-to-apples-official-figures-ios-10-adoption-rate-now-at-54/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9 in the preceding year, a result speculated by ''[[MacRumors]]''{{'}}s Tim Hardwick as being caused by an early release issue that disabled some devices and may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple Puts Official iOS 10 Adoption Rate Figure at 54% |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/11/apple-ios-10-adoption-rate-figure-at-54/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> User adoption increased to 76% of active devices in January 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on 76% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/05/ios-10-installed-on-76-percent-of-ios-devices/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> 79% in February 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on Nearly 80% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/22/ios-10-nearly-80-percent-adoption/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=February 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> 86% in June 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple introduces iOS 11 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 5, 2017}}</ref> 87% in July 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Chokkattu |title=About 87 percent of active Apple iPhone and iPad devices run iOS 10 |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-distribution-news/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=August 21, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref> and 89% in September 2017 before the release of [[iOS 11]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sebastien |last=Page |title=iOS 10 adoption reaches 89% ahead of iOS 11 launch |url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/10/ios-10-adoption-reaches-89-ahead-of-ios-11-launch/ |website=iDownloadBlog |date=September 10, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Problems ==\n\n=== Initial release bricking issue ===\nThe initial public release of iOS 10 on September 13, 2016 saw many [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s temporarily disabled, or \"bricked\", by the over-the-air update, requiring bricked devices to be connected to a [[Macintosh|Mac]] or [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] with [[iTunes]] in order to retry the update or restore the device to factory settings.

He is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry, including ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', ''[[The Dunciad]]'', and ''[[An Essay on Criticism]],'' as well as for his translation of [[Homer]]. After [[Shakespeare]], Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language, as per ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'',<ref>''Dictionary of Quotations'' (1999)</ref> some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., [[Damning with faint praise]]). He is considered a master of the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nPope's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages, of health and of circumstance. The poet and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and thus fell subject to the [[Test Act]]s, prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of [[James II of England|James II]]; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, and another from attending public school or university. For this reason, except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books. He learned French, Italian, Latin, and Greek by himself, and discovered Homer at the age of six. As a child Pope survived being once trampled by a cow, but when he was 12 began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ([[Pott disease]]), along with fits of crippling headaches which troubled him throughout his life. \n\nIn the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the time he was 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the essay was met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, most notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently started collaborating on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having located an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he considered the impudence of the younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and, save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.\n\n''The Rape of the Lock'', perhaps the poet's most famous poem, appeared first in 1712, followed by a revised and enlarged version in 1714. When [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] forcibly snipped off a lock from Miss [[Arabella Fermor]]'s head (the \"Belinda\" of the poem), the incident gave rise to a high-society quarrel between the families. With the idea of allaying this, Pope treated the subject in a playful and witty [[mock-heroic]] epic. The narrative poem brings into focus the onset of acquisitive individualism and conspicuous consumption, where purchased goods assume dominance over moral agency. \n\nA folio comprising a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, together with two new ones written about the passion of love. These were ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in the popular poem ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued throughout his life. \n\nIn his career as a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as the critics, politicians, and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharpwitted satires. Some were so virulent, that Pope even carried pistols at one point while walking his dog. After 1738, Pope composed relatively little. He toyed with the idea of writing a patriotic epic called ''Brutus.'' He mainly revised and expanded his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, he replaced Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, his real target in the poem is the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]]. By now Pope's health was failing, and when told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms\".\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Pope.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Alexander Pope''.

His father (also Alexander, 1646\u20131717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643\u20131733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]]. Pope's education was affected by the recently enacted [[Test Act]]s, which upheld the status of the [[state church|established]] [[Church of England]] and banned Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Such schools, while illegal, were tolerated in some areas.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\">'Alexander Pope', ''Literature Online biography'' (2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:AlexanderPope.jpg|thumb|left|A look-a-like of Pope derived from a portrait by [[William Hoare]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Alexander+Pope&LinkID=mp03609&rNo=6&role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait  \u2013 NPG 299; Alexander Pope |work=npg.org.uk}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing \"Papists\" from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.<ref>\"An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants\" (3. Jac. 1, v).

Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref> Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the [[Satire|satirists]] [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]], the [[Epic poetry|epic poets]] [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], as well as English authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Dryden]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> He studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /><ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nAt Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nFrom the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]] (a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine), which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes, and abdominal pain.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He grew to a height of only {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Pope was already removed from society because he was Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

In particular, discussion of the controversy over whether the relationship was sexual is described in some detail on pp.76\u201378.</ref> His friend [[William Cheselden]] said, according to [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], \"I could give a more particular account of Mr. Pope's health than perhaps any man.

Livingstone, 1953, p.89</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]\n\nIn May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]\n\nAround 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. The aim of the club was to satirise ignorance and pedantry in the form of the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/> was published to great acclaim.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nDuring Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process \u2013 publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nIn 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, \"where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known\". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.\n\nPope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red brick building is now the [[Mawson Arms]], commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"ChiswickHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |accessdate=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}</ref>\n\nThe money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked that: \"Were it to have nymphs as well \u2013 it would be complete in everything.\" Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives. It now lies beneath Radnor House Independent Co-ed School and is occasionally opened to the public.<ref name=\"Gordon 2002\"/><ref>''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Mawson Arms 01.JPG|thumb|[[Mawson Arms]], Chiswick Lane, with [[blue plaque]] to Pope]]\n\n===''Essay on Criticism''===\n{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}\n''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.\n\nAt the time the poem was published, the [[heroic couplet]] style in which it was written was a moderately new poetic form, and Pope's work was an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. The poem was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.<ref name=\"Rogers 2006\">Rogers (2006)</ref>\n\nThe 'essay' begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgment. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority that he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while critiquing poetry, and points out that critics serve an important function in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to the practice of attacking them.<ref name=\"Baines 2001\">Baines (2001)</ref> The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in the ideal critic, who, Pope claims, is also the ideal man.\n\n===''The Rape of the Lock''===\nPope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version published in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the \"Belinda\" of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without her permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine and almost voyeuristic interest in the \"beau-monde\" (fashionable world) of 18th-century English society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-31 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}</ref> The revised and extended version of the poem brought more clearly into focus its true subject \u2013 the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers.

Pope pilloried a host of other \"hacks\", \"scribblers\" and \"dunces\" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication \"in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life.\" Though a masterpiece which would become \"one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry\", writes Mack, \"it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.\"<ref>Maynard Mack. ''Alexander Pope: A Life'' (W.W. Norton & Company, and [[Yale University Press]], 1985), pp. 472-3.</ref>\n\nAccording to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him. \"My brother does not seem to know what fear is,\" she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]], Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.<ref>Joseph Spence.

Although he was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, Pope never missed an opportunity to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes are a constant in his work.\n\nIn 1731, Pope published his \"Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]],\" on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems which would later be grouped under the title ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731\u201335). In the epistle, Pope ridiculed the bad taste of the aristocrat \"Timon.\" Pope's enemies claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did Pope a great deal of damage.\n\n===''An Essay on Man''===\n{{main|An Essay on Man}}\n\n''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem, written in heroic couplets and published between 1732 and 1734. Pope intended this poem to be the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics that was to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece of work that Pope intended to make into a larger work; however, he did not live to complete it.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\">Nuttal (1984)</ref>\n\nThe poem is an attempt to \"vindicate the ways of God to Man\", a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to \"justify the ways of God to Man\" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however; it makes an assumption that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]\n\nIt consists of four epistles that are addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]]. Pope presents an idea on his view of the Universe; he says that no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe appears to be, it functions in a rational fashion according to the natural laws. The natural laws consider the Universe as a whole a perfect work of God. To humans, it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope points out that this is due to our limited mindset and limited intellectual capacity. Pope gets the message across that humans must accept their position in the \"Great Chain of Being\" which is at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. If we are able to accomplish this then we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\nThe poem is an affirmative poem of faith: life seems to be chaotic and confusing to man when he is in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is really divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around in order to have an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and can experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope which then leads into faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it, in terms of riches, power, and fame. It is man's duty to strive to be good regardless of other situations: this is the message Pope is trying to get across to the reader.<ref>Cassirer (1944)</ref>\n\n===Later life and works===\n[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]\n\nThe ''Imitations of Horace'' followed (1733\u201338). These were written in the popular Augustan form of the \"imitation\" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he regarded as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste.\n\nPope also added a wholly original poem, ''[[Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot]]'', as an introduction to the \"Imitations\". It reviews his own literary career and includes the famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] (\"[[Sporus]]\") and Addison (\"Atticus\"). In 1738 he wrote the ''Universal Prayer''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=Trevor W. McKeown |work=bcy.ca}} [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3702-w0010.shtml Full-text] also at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref>\n\nAfter 1738, Pope wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in these years was revising and expanding his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, Pope replaced the \"hero\" Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and all his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A.

On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]]. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].\n\n==Translations and editions==\n\n===Translation of the ''Iliad''===\nPope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (\u00a3210) a volume, equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|210|1713|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}},{{Inflation-fn|UK}} a vast sum at the time.\n\nHis translation of the ''Iliad'' appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\" (although the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\").{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Translation of the ''Odyssey''===\n[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's '''''Odyssey'''''|alt=]]\nEncouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725 and 1726.<ref>{{cite book |author=Homer |last-author-amp=true |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725\u20131726 |location=5 vols.

Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespearean material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> In 1726, lawyer, poet and pantomime deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested a number of revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, and thus, Theobald was the main target of Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272</ref><ref>[[The Dunciad]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> Aside from making some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.\n\n==Reception==\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences (believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition), [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent to be a representation of the human condition.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" /> George Gilfillan in his study of 1856 described Pope's talent as \"a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful\".<ref>Gilfillan, George. ''The Genius and Poetry of Pope'', The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, Vol 11, 1856</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, Pope's reputation was revived. Pope's work was, of course, full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The postwar period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, a Pope scholar of the mid-to-late 20th century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes, including an index volume.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\n==Works==\n===Major works===\n* 1709: ''Pastorals''\n* 1711: ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]''<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref>\n* 1712: ''[[Messiah (English poem)|Messiah]]'' (from the [[Book of Isaiah]], and later [[Messiah (Latin poem)|translated into Latin]] by [[Samuel Johnson]])\n* 1712: ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' (enlarged in 1714)<ref name=cocel/>\n* 1713: ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/><ref name=cocel/>\n* 1715: ''[[The House of Fame#Adaptations|The Temple of Fame: A Vision]]''<ref>Pope, Alexander.

He is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry, including ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', ''[[The Dunciad]]'', and ''[[An Essay on Criticism]],'' as well as for his translation of [[Homer]]. After [[Shakespeare]], Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language, as per ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'',<ref>''Dictionary of Quotations'' (1999)</ref> some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., [[Damning with faint praise]]). He is considered a master of the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nPope's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages, of health and of circumstance. The poet and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and thus fell subject to the [[Test Act]]s, prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of [[James II of England|James II]]; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, and another from attending public school or university. For this reason, except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books. He learned French, Italian, Latin, and Greek by himself, and discovered Homer at the age of six. As a child Pope survived being once trampled by a cow, but when he was 12 began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ([[Pott disease]]), along with fits of crippling headaches which troubled him throughout his life. \n\nIn the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the time he was 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the essay was met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, most notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently started collaborating on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having located an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he considered the impudence of the younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and, save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.\n\n''The Rape of the Lock'', perhaps the poet's most famous poem, appeared first in 1712, followed by a revised and enlarged version in 1714. When [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] forcibly snipped off a lock from Miss [[Arabella Fermor]]'s head (the \"Belinda\" of the poem), the incident gave rise to a high-society quarrel between the families. With the idea of allaying this, Pope treated the subject in a playful and witty [[mock-heroic]] epic. The narrative poem brings into focus the onset of acquisitive individualism and conspicuous consumption, where purchased goods assume dominance over moral agency. \n\nA folio comprising a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, together with two new ones written about the passion of love. These were ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in the popular poem ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued throughout his life. \n\nIn his career as a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as the critics, politicians, and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharpwitted satires. Some were so virulent, that Pope even carried pistols at one point while walking his dog. After 1738, Pope composed relatively little. He toyed with the idea of writing a patriotic epic called ''Brutus.'' He mainly revised and expanded his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, he replaced Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, his real target in the poem is the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]]. By now Pope's health was failing, and when told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms\".\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Pope.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Alexander Pope''.

His father (also Alexander, 1646\u20131717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643\u20131733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]].

Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Such schools, while illegal, were tolerated in some areas.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\">'Alexander Pope', ''Literature Online biography'' (2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:AlexanderPope.jpg|thumb|left|A look-a-like of Pope derived from a portrait by [[William Hoare]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Alexander+Pope&LinkID=mp03609&rNo=6&role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait  \u2013 NPG 299; Alexander Pope |work=npg.org.uk}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing Papists from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.<ref>\"An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants\" (3.

After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /><ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nAt Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nFrom the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]] (a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine), which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes, and abdominal pain.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He grew to a height of only {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Pope was already removed from society because he was Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

Livingstone, 1953, p.89</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]\n\nIn May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]\n\nAround 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. The aim of the club was to satirise ignorance and pedantry in the form of the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/> was published to great acclaim.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nDuring Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process \u2013 publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nIn 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, \"where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known\". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.\n\nPope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red brick building is now the [[Mawson Arms]], commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"ChiswickHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |accessdate=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}</ref>\n\nThe money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked that: \"Were it to have nymphs as well \u2013 it would be complete in everything.\" Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives. It now lies beneath Radnor House Independent Co-ed School and is occasionally opened to the public.<ref name=\"Gordon 2002\"/><ref>''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Mawson Arms 01.JPG|thumb|[[Mawson Arms]], Chiswick Lane, with [[blue plaque]] to Pope]]\n\n===''Essay on Criticism''===\n{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}\n''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.\n\nAt the time the poem was published, the [[heroic couplet]] style in which it was written was a moderately new poetic form, and Pope's work was an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. The poem was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.<ref name=\"Rogers 2006\">Rogers (2006)</ref>\n\nThe 'essay' begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgment. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority that he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while critiquing poetry, and points out that critics serve an important function in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to the practice of attacking them.<ref name=\"Baines 2001\">Baines (2001)</ref> The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in the ideal critic, who, Pope claims, is also the ideal man.\n\n===''The Rape of the Lock''===\nPope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version published in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the \"Belinda\" of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without her permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine and almost voyeuristic interest in the \"beau-monde\" (fashionable world) of 18th-century English society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-31 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}</ref> The revised and extended version of the poem brought more clearly into focus its true subject \u2013 the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers.

Pope pilloried a host of other \"hacks\", \"scribblers\" and \"dunces\" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication \"in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life.\" Though a masterpiece which would become \"one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry\", writes Mack, \"it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.\"<ref>Maynard Mack. ''Alexander Pope: A Life'' (W.W. Norton & Company, and [[Yale University Press]], 1985), pp. 472-3.</ref>\n\nAccording to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him. \"My brother does not seem to know what fear is,\" she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]], Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.<ref>Joseph Spence.

Although he was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, Pope never missed an opportunity to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes are a constant in his work.\n\nIn 1731, Pope published his \"Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]],\" on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems which would later be grouped under the title ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731\u201335). In the epistle, Pope ridiculed the bad taste of the aristocrat \"Timon.\" Pope's enemies claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did Pope a great deal of damage.\n\n===''An Essay on Man''===\n{{main|An Essay on Man}}\n\n''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem, written in heroic couplets and published between 1732 and 1734. Pope intended this poem to be the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics that was to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece of work that Pope intended to make into a larger work; however, he did not live to complete it.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\">Nuttal (1984)</ref>\n\nThe poem is an attempt to \"vindicate the ways of God to Man\", a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to \"justify the ways of God to Man\" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however; it makes an assumption that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]\n\nIt consists of four epistles that are addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]]. Pope presents an idea on his view of the Universe; he says that no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe appears to be, it functions in a rational fashion according to the natural laws. The natural laws consider the Universe as a whole a perfect work of God. To humans, it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope points out that this is due to our limited mindset and limited intellectual capacity. Pope gets the message across that humans must accept their position in the \"Great Chain of Being\" which is at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. If we are able to accomplish this then we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\nThe poem is an affirmative poem of faith: life seems to be chaotic and confusing to man when he is in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is really divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around in order to have an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and can experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope which then leads into faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it, in terms of riches, power, and fame. It is man's duty to strive to be good regardless of other situations: this is the message Pope is trying to get across to the reader.<ref>Cassirer (1944)</ref>\n\n===Later life and works===\n[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]\n\nThe ''Imitations of Horace'' followed (1733\u201338). These were written in the popular Augustan form of the \"imitation\" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he regarded as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste.\n\nPope also added a wholly original poem, ''[[Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot]]'', as an introduction to the \"Imitations\". It reviews his own literary career and includes the famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] (\"[[Sporus]]\") and Addison (\"Atticus\"). In 1738 he wrote the ''Universal Prayer''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=Trevor W.

He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in these years was revising and expanding his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, Pope replaced the \"hero\" Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and all his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A.

On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]]. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].\n\n==Translations and editions==\n\n===Translation of the ''Iliad''===\nPope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (\u00a3210) a volume, equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|210|1713|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}},{{Inflation-fn|UK}} a vast sum at the time.\n\nHis translation of the ''Iliad'' appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\" (although the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\").{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Translation of the ''Odyssey''===\n[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's '''''Odyssey'''''|alt=]]\nEncouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725 and 1726.<ref>{{cite book |author=Homer |last-author-amp=true |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725\u20131726 |location=5 vols.

Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespearean material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> In 1726, lawyer, poet and pantomime deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested a number of revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, and thus, Theobald was the main target of Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272</ref><ref>[[The Dunciad]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> Aside from making some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.\n\n==Reception==\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences (believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition), [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent to be a representation of the human condition.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" /> George Gilfillan in his study of 1856 described Pope's talent as \"a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful\".<ref>Gilfillan, George. ''The Genius and Poetry of Pope'', The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, Vol 11, 1856</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, Pope's reputation was revived. Pope's work was, of course, full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The postwar period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, a Pope scholar of the mid-to-late 20th century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes, including an index volume.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\n==Works==\n===Major works===\n* 1709: ''Pastorals''\n* 1711: ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]''<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref>\n* 1712: ''[[Messiah (English poem)|Messiah]]'' (from the [[Book of Isaiah]], and later [[Messiah (Latin poem)|translated into Latin]] by [[Samuel Johnson]])\n* 1712: ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' (enlarged in 1714)<ref name=cocel/>\n* 1713: ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/><ref name=cocel/>\n* 1715: ''[[The House of Fame#Adaptations|The Temple of Fame: A Vision]]''<ref>Pope, Alexander.

The epidemic in China is at its end, it started on 7 December [2019] when the first case was reported. It is already known that virulence of the virus is in decline, hence the virus becomes more and more weak as the time passes by. But the virus is weak in any case. Here's something regarding women... The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus. So, women, you can go shopping to Italy, I've heard that, now, there will be huge discounts there, because now nobody wants to go to Italy. So, prepare your husbands mentally for that. I am joking, but for real, I think, I don't understand. Couple of days ago I was shocked when that story (about the virus) started because the virus itself was laughable.
