According to the [[BBC]], the Oxford PPE \"dominate[s] public life\" (in the UK).<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11136511 |title=Why does PPE rule Britain? | last1=Kelly | first1=Jon |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> It is now offered at several other leading colleges and universities around the world. More recently Warwick University and King\u2019s College added a new degree under the name of PPL (Politics, Philosophy and Law) with the aim to bring an alternative to the more classical PPE degrees. In the [[United States]], it is offered by two [[Ivy League]] universities--the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Yale University]] (under the designation Ethics, Politics and Economics). In the non-English speaking world the French \"grande \u00e9cole\" Sciences Po (Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris originally, now existing in 8 other big French cities: Aix, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Rennes, Strasbourg and Toulouse) offers since the late 19th century an approaching cursus with a wide variety of electives. Sciences Po has been emulated in a number of countries. A good number of French political and entrepreunarial elite and civil servants are Sciences Po graduates, though the vast majority of political ministers and elected officials at the national level prefers or adds the even more selective \"grande \u00e9cole\" ENA (\u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration). In Spain, The Alliance 4 Universities composed by Carlos III University, Pompeu Fabra University, Autonomous University of Madrid and Autonomous University of Barcelona also offers the degree to a reduced number of high performance students.\n\n== History ==\nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics was established as a degree course at the University of Oxford in the 1920s,<ref>[http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp#_Toc146507694] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830181845/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp|date=2009-08-30}} \"Balliol was the birthplace of the modern degree of PPE in the 1920s. A. D. Lindsay, who subsequently became the master of the college, played a key role in the establishment of the degree and Balliol has long remained a major college for the study of PPE, and PPE has long been a major subject within Balliol.\"</ref> as a modern alternative to [[classics]] (known as \"[[literae humaniores]]\" or \"greats\" at Oxford) because it was thought as a more modern alternative for those entering the [[civil service]]. It was thus initially known as \"modern greats\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/the_faculty/history_of_philosophy |title=History of Philosophy at Oxford \u2013 Faculty of Philosophy |publisher=Philosophy.ox.ac.uk |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> The first PPE students commenced their course in the autumn of 1921.<ref name=graun /> The regulation by which it was established is Statt. Tit. VI. Sect. 1 C; \"the subject of the Honour School of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics shall be the study of the structure, and the philosophical and economic principles, of Modern Society.\"<ref>University of Oxford (1926) ''The Examination Statutes. together with the regulations of the boards of studies and boards of faculties for the academical year 1926-1927''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 149=54</ref> Initially it was compulsory to study all three subjects for all three years of the course, but in 1970 this requirement was relaxed, and since then students have been able to drop one subject after the first year \u2013 most do this, but a minority continue with all three.<ref name=graun />\n\nDuring the 1960s some students started to critique the course from a left-wing perspective, culminating in the publication of a pamphlet, ''The Poverty of PPE'', in 1968, written by Trevor Pateman, who argued that it \"gives no training in scholarship, only refining to a high degree of perfection the ability to write short dilettantish essays on the basis of very little knowledge: ideal training for the social engineer\". The pamphlet advocated incorporating the study of sociology, anthropology and art, and to take on the aim of \"assist(ing) the radicalisation and mobilisation of political opinion outside the university\". In response, some minor changes were made, with influential leftist writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[R\u00e9gis Debray]] being added to politics reading lists, but the core of the programme remained the same.<ref name=graun />\n\nChristopher Stray has pointed to the course as one reason for the gradual decline of the study of classics, as classicists in political life began to be edged out by those who had studied the modern greats.<ref>Christopher Stray, ''Classics Transformed: Schools, Universities, and Society in England, 1830\u20131960''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998. Pp. xiv, 336. {{ISBN|0-19-815013-X}}.</ref>\n\nDario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk have described the course as being fundamental to the development of political thought in the UK, since it established a connection between politics and philosophy. Previously at Oxford, and for some time subsequently at Cambridge, politics had been taught only as a branch of modern history.<ref>Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk, ''The History of Political Thought in National Context''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-78234-1}}</ref>\n\n== Course material ==\nThe programme is rooted in the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks. In this regard, the study of [[philosophy]] is considered important because it both equips students with [[meta-tools]] such as the ability to [[reason]] rigorously and [[logic]]ally, and facilitates [[ethical]] reflection. The study of [[politics]] is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the institutions that govern society and help solve [[collective action]] problems. Finally, studying [[economics]] is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events. The vast majority of students at Oxford drop one of the three subjects for the second and third years of their course. Oxford now has more than 600 undergraduates studying the subject, admitting over 200 each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|title=Why Study PPE at Oxford?|work=ox.ac.uk|access-date=2012-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711084739/https://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Academic opinions ==\nOxford PPE graduate [[Nick Cohen]] and former tutor Iain McLean consider the course's breadth important to its appeal, especially \"because British society values generalists over specialists\". Academic and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]] noted that \"PPE combines the status of an elite university degree \u2013 PPE is the ultimate form of being good at school \u2013 with the stamp of a vocational course. It is perfect training for cabinet membership, and it gives you a view of life\". However he also noted that it had an orientation towards consensus politics and [[technocracy]].<ref name=graun />\n\n[[Geoff Evans (political scientist)|Geoffrey Evans]], an Oxford fellow in politics and a senior tutor, critiques that the Oxford course's success and consequent over-demand is a self-perpetuating feature of those in front of and behind the scenes in national administration, in stating \"all in all, it's how the class system works\". In the current economic system he bemoans the unavoidable inequalities besetting admissions and thereby enviable recruitment prospects of successful graduates. The argument itself intended as a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] ethical reflection on how governments and peoples can perpetuate [[social stratification]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n[[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]], a former adviser to [[Ed Miliband]] who studied PPE at Oxford in the 1980s and taught politics there in the 1990s and 2000s, acknowledged that the programme has been slow to catch up with contemporary political developments, saying that \"it does still feel like a course for people who are going to run the Raj in 1936... In the politics part of PPE, you can go three years without discussing a single contemporary public policy issue\". He also stated that the structure of the course gave it a [[centrist]] bias, due to the range of material covered: \"...most students think, mistakenly, that the only way to do it justice is to take a centre position\".<ref name=graun />\n\n== List of offering universities ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Durham University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ppe/ |title=Philosophy, Politics and Economics - Durham University |publisher=Dur.ac.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref>\n*[[Goldsmiths, University of London]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/ug/ba-politics-philosophy-economics/ |title=BA (Hons) Politics, Philosophy & Economics, Goldsmiths, University of London |publisher=gold.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref>\n*[[Keele University]]\n*[[King's College London]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/politicaleconomy/study/ug/Upcoming-Programmes-201516.aspx|title=King's College London - Upcoming Programmes 2015/16|work=kcl.ac.uk}}</ref>\n*[[Kingston University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/philosophy-politics-economics-ma/ |title=Philosophy, Politics, Economics MA |publisher=kingston.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref>\n*[[Lancaster University]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA Hons|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/philosophy-politics-and-economics-ba-hons-l0v0/|publisher=Lancaster University|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n*[[London School of Economics]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/degreeProgrammes2015/philosophyLogicAndScientificMethod/L0V0_BSc_PPE.aspx |title=BSc Philosophy, Politics and Economics (Four Year Programme) |publisher=lse.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-11-02}}</ref>\n*[[The Open University]]<ref>[http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/q45.htm Q45 - BA (Honours) Politics, Philosophy and Economics - Open University Degree]. .open.ac.uk (2012-10-16).

More recently Warwick University and King\u2019s College added a new degree under the name of PPL (Politics, Philosophy and Law) with the aim to bring an alternative to the more classical PPE degrees. In the [[United States]], it is offered by two [[Ivy League]] universities--the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Yale University]] (under the designation Ethics, Politics and Economics). In the non-English speaking world the French \"grande \u00e9cole\" Sciences Po (Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris originally, now existing in 8 other big French cities: Aix, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Rennes, Strasbourg and Toulouse) offers since the late 19th century an approaching cursus with a wide variety of electives. Sciences Po has been emulated in a number of countries. A good number of French political and entrepreunarial elite and civil servants are Sciences Po graduates, though the vast majority of political ministers and elected officials at the national level prefers or adds the even more selective \"grande \u00e9cole\" ENA (\u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration). In Spain, The Alliance 4 Universities composed by Carlos III University, Pompeu Fabra University, Autonomous University of Madrid and Autonomous University of Barcelona also offers the degree to a reduced number of high performance students.\n\n== History ==\nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics was established as a degree course at the University of Oxford in the 1920s,<ref>[http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp#_Toc146507694] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830181845/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp|date=2009-08-30}} \"Balliol was the birthplace of the modern degree of PPE in the 1920s. A. D. Lindsay, who subsequently became the master of the college, played a key role in the establishment of the degree and Balliol has long remained a major college for the study of PPE, and PPE has long been a major subject within Balliol.\"</ref> as a modern alternative to [[classics]] (known as \"[[literae humaniores]]\" or \"greats\" at Oxford) because it was thought as a more modern alternative for those entering the [[civil service]].

Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 149=54</ref> Initially it was compulsory to study all three subjects for all three years of the course, but in 1970 this requirement was relaxed, and since then students have been able to drop one subject after the first year \u2013 most do this, but a minority continue with all three.<ref name=graun />\n\nDuring the 1960s some students started to critique the course from a left-wing perspective, culminating in the publication of a pamphlet, ''The Poverty of PPE'', in 1968, written by Trevor Pateman, who argued that it \"gives no training in scholarship, only refining to a high degree of perfection the ability to write short dilettantish essays on the basis of very little knowledge: ideal training for the social engineer\". The pamphlet advocated incorporating the study of sociology, anthropology and art, and to take on the aim of \"assist(ing) the radicalisation and mobilisation of political opinion outside the university\". In response, some minor changes were made, with influential leftist writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[R\u00e9gis Debray]] being added to politics reading lists, but the core of the programme remained the same.<ref name=graun />\n\nChristopher Stray has pointed to the course as one reason for the gradual decline of the study of classics, as classicists in political life began to be edged out by those who had studied the modern greats.<ref>Christopher Stray, ''Classics Transformed: Schools, Universities, and Society in England, 1830\u20131960''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998. Pp. xiv, 336. {{ISBN|0-19-815013-X}}.</ref>\n\nDario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk have described the course as being fundamental to the development of political thought in the UK, since it established a connection between politics and philosophy. Previously at Oxford, and for some time subsequently at Cambridge, politics had been taught only as a branch of modern history.<ref>Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk, ''The History of Political Thought in National Context''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-78234-1}}</ref>\n\n== Course material ==\nThe programme is rooted in the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks. In this regard, the study of [[philosophy]] is considered important because it both equips students with [[meta-tools]] such as the ability to [[reason]] rigorously and [[logic]]ally, and facilitates [[ethical]] reflection. The study of [[politics]] is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the institutions that govern society and help solve [[collective action]] problems. Finally, studying [[economics]] is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events. The vast majority of students at Oxford drop one of the three subjects for the second and third years of their course. Oxford now has more than 600 undergraduates studying the subject, admitting over 200 each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|title=Why Study PPE at Oxford?|work=ox.ac.uk|access-date=2012-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711084739/https://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Academic opinions ==\nOxford PPE graduate [[Nick Cohen]] and former tutor Iain McLean consider the course's breadth important to its appeal, especially \"because British society values generalists over specialists\". Academic and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]] noted that \"PPE combines the status of an elite university degree \u2013 PPE is the ultimate form of being good at school \u2013 with the stamp of a vocational course. It is perfect training for cabinet membership, and it gives you a view of life\". However he also noted that it had an orientation towards consensus politics and [[technocracy]].<ref name=graun />\n\n[[Geoff Evans (political scientist)|Geoffrey Evans]], an Oxford fellow in politics and a senior tutor, critiques that the Oxford course's success and consequent over-demand is a self-perpetuating feature of those in front of and behind the scenes in national administration, in stating \"all in all, it's how the class system works\". In the current economic system he bemoans the unavoidable inequalities besetting admissions and thereby enviable recruitment prospects of successful graduates. The argument itself intended as a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] ethical reflection on how governments and peoples can perpetuate [[social stratification]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n[[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]], a former adviser to [[Ed Miliband]] who studied PPE at Oxford in the 1980s and taught politics there in the 1990s and 2000s, acknowledged that the programme has been slow to catch up with contemporary political developments, saying that \"it does still feel like a course for people who are going to run the Raj in 1936... In the politics part of PPE, you can go three years without discussing a single contemporary public policy issue\". He also stated that the structure of the course gave it a [[centrist]] bias, due to the range of material covered: \"...most students think, mistakenly, that the only way to do it justice is to take a centre position\".<ref name=graun />\n\n== List of offering universities ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Durham University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ppe/ |title=Philosophy, Politics and Economics - Durham University |publisher=Dur.ac.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref>\n*[[Goldsmiths, University of London]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/ug/ba-politics-philosophy-economics/ |title=BA (Hons) Politics, Philosophy & Economics, Goldsmiths, University of London |publisher=gold.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref>\n*[[Keele University]]\n*[[King's College London]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/politicaleconomy/study/ug/Upcoming-Programmes-201516.aspx|title=King's College London - Upcoming Programmes 2015/16|work=kcl.ac.uk}}</ref>\n*[[Kingston University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/philosophy-politics-economics-ma/ |title=Philosophy, Politics, Economics MA |publisher=kingston.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref>\n*[[Lancaster University]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA Hons|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/philosophy-politics-and-economics-ba-hons-l0v0/|publisher=Lancaster University|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n*[[London School of Economics]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/degreeProgrammes2015/philosophyLogicAndScientificMethod/L0V0_BSc_PPE.aspx |title=BSc Philosophy, Politics and Economics (Four Year Programme) |publisher=lse.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-11-02}}</ref>\n*[[The Open University]]<ref>[http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/q45.htm Q45 - BA (Honours) Politics, Philosophy and Economics - Open University Degree]. .open.ac.uk (2012-10-16).

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.

Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.

By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job. By August 1945, everything was prepped for the invasion of the Japan.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nWhen the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35}} arrived at Tinian<ref name=\"USSINDIA\">[https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/08/05/this-week-in-seabee-history-august-5-august-11/ \"August 6, 1945, This Week in Seabee History\"],  Dr. Frank A.

With a war to wage field modification was much quicker than going through official military procurement channels.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.

The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.
