In fact, some of the complaints were filed even before the [[impeachment]] trial started on November 20, 2000. Certainly much before the \"second envelope\" incident during the impeachment trial which galvanized an outraged nation into an [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|EDSA II]]. The complainants were [[criminal justice]] advocate Dante Jimenez, [[human rights law]]yer Romeo Capulong, noted [[trial lawyer]] Leonard De Vera, the late 1971 [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] delegate Ramon A. Gonzales, lawyers Ernesto Francisco, Jr., [[Antonio T. Carpio]] (later Supreme Court Associate Justice), and Dennis B. Funa. One complaint which would be the core of the criminal charges against Estrada and which would ripen to Criminal Case No. 26558 was docketed as OMB-0-00-1756 (Romeo T. Capulong, Leonard de Vera and Dennis Funa vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, [[Luisa Ejercito Estrada|Dr. Luisa \"Loi\" Ejercito]], [[Jinggoy Estrada|Jose \"Jinggoy\" Estrada]], Charlie \"Atong\" Ang, Delia Rajas, Eleuterio Tan, and Alma Alfaro; see Victor Jose Tan Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman et al., G.R. No. 156399-400, June 27, 2008). Because of his incumbency as President and the inherent [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity from suit]] that went with that incumbency, the Ombudsman did not proceed with its investigation of the complaints. It was only after President Estrada had been stripped of his immunity, as a result of his (implied) resignation from office on January 20, 2001, that the Ombudsman acted upon the complaints. On January 22, 2001, a mere two days after his resignation, President Estrada, now without presidential immunity, was ordered by the Ombudsman to file his counter-[[affidavit]] in answer to the complaints filed against him. On September 12, 2007, former President Joseph E. Estrada was found guilty of Plunder in Criminal Case No. 26558 by the Sandiganbayan Special Division and sentenced to [[reclusi\u00f3n perpetua]]. On October 25, 2007, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|President Macapagal-Arroyo]] granted [[executive clemency]] to Estrada. The pardon took effect the next day when Estrada accepted the pardon on October 26, 2007 at 3:35&nbsp;pm.\n\nFor his participation and contribution in these historic events, he was commended by the multi-sectoral Kongreso ng Mamamayang Pilipino (KOMPIL II) in 2001.<ref>http://www.channelone.tv/news/news150/news/today/102k/story/10000071.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsbreak.com.ph/democracyandgovernance/articles_legaleagles.html |title=Democracy and Governance in the Philippines \u2013 The Legal Eagles who nailed Erap |publisher=Newsbreak.com.ph |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930162124/http://www.newsbreak.com.ph/democracyandgovernance/articles_legaleagles.html |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.channelone.tv/news/news150/news/today/112k/text/1100t0017.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/jan2003/148468.htm |title=Serapio vs Sandiganbayan : 148468 : January 28, 2003 : En Banc |publisher=Sc.judiciary.gov.ph |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318154038/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/jan2003/148468.htm |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37715 |title=ERAP mistress Laarni Enriquez |publisher=PinoyExchange |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/archive1/021Coverage%20trial.html |title=Bulatlat.com |publisher=Bulatlat.com |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&dat=20010217&id ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Date: Saturday, October 22, 2011 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20/%20Signed%20Resolutions&docid=12161068121315783156 |title=Supreme Court E-Library \u2013 G.R.

Funa was charged for libel, together with former beauty queen Joelle Pelaez, news reporter Christine Herrera, newspaper Editor-in-Chief Jojo Robles, and newspaper publisher Teodoro L. Locsin, Jr., by former Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada in a Complaint-Affidavit dated August 2, 2006 filed before the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal. Estrada demanded 30 million pesos in damages. The libel charge emanated from a five-part investigative report appearing in the Manila Standard Today, a general circulation newspaper in the Philippines. The news series purportedly narrated allegations of money-laundering by some Philippine government officials. Funa was quoted in one interview stating: \"The commercial transaction of this magnitude could not have been consummated without the knowledge of the highest officials at the time. We must take note that the commercial transaction occurred sometime in March and mid-2000 and were perfected just before the start of the impeachment proceedings.\" Funa was then representing as legal counsel Joelle Pelaez, a beauty titlist being romantically linked at that time to the former President, a story Estrada has denied. When the libel complaint was filed, former President Estrada was being detained in his resthouse in Tanay, Rizal pending his trial for plunder.

In fact, some of the complaints were filed even before the [[impeachment]] trial started on November 20, 2000. Certainly much before the \"second envelope\" incident during the impeachment trial which galvanized an outraged nation into an [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|EDSA II]]. The complainants were [[criminal justice]] advocate Dante Jimenez, [[human rights law]]yer Romeo Capulong, noted [[trial lawyer]] Leonard De Vera, the late 1971 [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] delegate Ramon A. Gonzales, lawyers Ernesto Francisco, Jr., [[Antonio T. Carpio]] (later Supreme Court Associate Justice), and Dennis B. Funa. One complaint which would be the core of the criminal charges against Estrada and which would ripen to Criminal Case No. 26558 was docketed as OMB-0-00-1756 (Romeo T. Capulong, Leonard de Vera and Dennis Funa vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, [[Luisa Ejercito Estrada|Dr. Luisa \"Loi\" Ejercito]], [[Jinggoy Estrada|Jose \"Jinggoy\" Estrada]], Charlie \"Atong\" Ang, Delia Rajas, Eleuterio Tan, and Alma Alfaro; see Victor Jose Tan Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman et al., G.R. No. 156399-400, June 27, 2008). Because of his incumbency as President and the inherent [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity from suit]] that went with that incumbency, the Ombudsman did not proceed with its investigation of the complaints. It was only after President Estrada had been stripped of his immunity, as a result of his (implied) resignation from office on January 20, 2001, that the Ombudsman acted upon the complaints. On January 22, 2001, a mere two days after his resignation, President Estrada, now without presidential immunity, was ordered by the Ombudsman to file his counter-[[affidavit]] in answer to the complaints filed against him. On September 12, 2007, former President Joseph E. Estrada was found guilty of Plunder in Criminal Case No. 26558 by the Sandiganbayan Special Division and sentenced to [[reclusi\u00f3n perpetua]]. On October 25, 2007, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|President Macapagal-Arroyo]] granted [[executive clemency]] to Estrada. The pardon took effect the next day when Estrada accepted the pardon on October 26, 2007 at 3:35&nbsp;pm.\n\nFor his participation and contribution in these historic events, he was commended by the multi-sectoral Kongreso ng Mamamayang Pilipino (KOMPIL II) in 2001.<ref>http://www.channelone.tv/news/news150/news/today/102k/story/10000071.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsbreak.com.ph/democracyandgovernance/articles_legaleagles.html |title=Democracy and Governance in the Philippines \u2013 The Legal Eagles who nailed Erap |publisher=Newsbreak.com.ph |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930162124/http://www.newsbreak.com.ph/democracyandgovernance/articles_legaleagles.html |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.channelone.tv/news/news150/news/today/112k/text/1100t0017.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/jan2003/148468.htm |title=Serapio vs Sandiganbayan : 148468 : January 28, 2003 : En Banc |publisher=Sc.judiciary.gov.ph |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318154038/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/jan2003/148468.htm |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37715 |title=ERAP mistress Laarni Enriquez |publisher=PinoyExchange |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/archive1/021Coverage%20trial.html |title=Bulatlat.com |publisher=Bulatlat.com |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&dat=20010217&id ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Date: Saturday, October 22, 2011 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20/%20Signed%20Resolutions&docid=12161068121315783156 |title=Supreme Court E-Library \u2013 G.R.

Funa was charged for libel, together with former beauty queen Joelle Pelaez, news reporter Christine Herrera, newspaper Editor-in-Chief Jojo Robles, and newspaper publisher Teodoro L. Locsin, Jr., by former Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada in a Complaint-Affidavit dated August 2, 2006 filed before the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal. Estrada demanded 30 million pesos in damages. The libel charge emanated from a five-part investigative report appearing in the Manila Standard Today, a general circulation newspaper in the Philippines. The news series purportedly narrated allegations of money-laundering by some Philippine government officials. Funa was quoted in one interview stating: \"The commercial transaction of this magnitude could not have been consummated without the knowledge of the highest officials at the time. We must take note that the commercial transaction occurred sometime in March and mid-2000 and were perfected just before the start of the impeachment proceedings.\" Funa was then representing as legal counsel Joelle Pelaez, a beauty titlist being romantically linked at that time to the former President, a story Estrada has denied. When the libel complaint was filed, former President Estrada was being detained in his resthouse in Tanay, Rizal pending his trial for plunder. Estrada sought permission from the Sandiganbayan (the anti-graft court) to leave his resthouse to file the complaint. The request was denied, and arrangements were made for the provincial prosecutors to go to Estrada\u2019s place of detention to receive the complaint-affidavit. The libel complaint was eventually dismissed on June 2007 by the prosecutors\u2019 office on the ground that being a public figure, remarks on Estrada\u2019s presidency constituted privileged statements and therefore not libelous.<ref>http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/2007/june/27/jojoRobles.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Philippine Headline News Online (Phno) |url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104464.htm |title=ERAP SIGNS P30-MILLION LIBEL SUIT VS FORMER BEAUTY QUEEN |publisher=Newsflash.org |date=May 19, 2006 |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426223018/http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104464.htm# |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mediawatch |url=http://www.cmfr-phil.org/2006/07/27/estrada-to-file-libel-against-manila-standard-today-others/ |title=Estrada to file libel against Manila Standard Today, others &#124; Center for Media Freedom & Responsibility |publisher=Cmfr-phil.org |date=July 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/2007/june/26/news5.htm</ref>\n\n== Insurance Commission ==\n\nIn June 2013, Funa was appointed by President Benigno S.

He began copying the Galland Manuscript, and as he did so, he adapted his exemplar, adding in some contemporary Syrianisms and more vulgar language for dramatic effect. At the point in the manuscript's sequence of stories where Galland had inserted the tale of Sindbad the Sailor in his ''Mille et une nuits'', Chavis added (as Nights 70-76) ''Harun al-Rashid and the Daughter of Kisra'' from another Arabic manuscript. Chavis copied almost all of the three volumes of the Galland Manuscript, breaking off in the story ''[[Jullanar of the Sea]]''.

He began by picking up where the real Galland Manuscript leaves off\u2014partway through the ''Tale of Qamar al-Zam\u0101n and Bud\u016br'' (a.k.a. ''Qamarazzman''), its ending lost because the Galland Manuscript is incomplete. Chavis completed this by translating the fuller French version constructed by Galland. Chavis then proceeded to include some other tales translated from Galland's French into Arabic, and some which he copied from a manuscript of stories in Arabic that he seems to have brought with him from Syria. Now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, this Arabic manuscript had been made by the scribe 'Ab\u012bd Rabbih in 1772. It does not style itself as a ''Nights'' manuscript but merely a collection of tales (though some do also occur in manuscripts of the ''Nights''). The following table lists the contents of Chavis's third volume.<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tale\n!Nights\n!Supposed Galland MS volume\n!Actual source\n|-\n|End of ''Qamarazzaman''\n|281-329\n|4\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 6\n|-\n|''The Sleeper Awakened''\n|330-379\n|4\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 9\n|-\n|''The Persian Physician and the Young Cook''\n|380-400\n|4\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|-\n|''The Unfortunate Youth in the Madhouse''\n|400-427\n|4\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|-\n|''Ghanim''\n|428-474\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 8\n|-\n|''[[Zayn Al-Asnam|Zayna Al-Asnam]]''\n|475-491\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 8\n|-\n|''[[Aladdin]]''\n|492-569\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 9\n|-\n|''Baktzad'' and ''The Ten Viziers''\n|570-631\n|5\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|}\nChavis's translation of ''Aladdin'' is particularly noteworthy. Galland's source for this story was [[Hanna Diyab]], who had apparently composed ''Aladdin'' himself and passed the tale to Galland in written form (whether in Arabic or French is not known). Since Diyab's manuscript of the story has never been found, Chavis's translation stands as the first known version of ''Aladdin'' in Arabic, and for many years scholars mistakenly thought it might represent a pre-Galland manuscript tradition of this story.<ref name=\":2\">Arafat A.

Chavis said he did, and Barde put Chavis into collaboration with the celebrated fairy-tale writer [[Jacques Cazotte]]. Surviving correspondence suggests an awkward collaboration, in which Chavis promised to deliver material and sought money but did not entirely satisfy Cazotte and Barde. It seems that Chavis made French translations of the manuscript he had produced, along with other stories (whether in note form or complete), sent this material to Cazotte, and Cazotte variously edited or rewrote it, adding further tales of his own invention (most notably one called ''Maugraby''). The resulting text was then edited further by Barde, and published in Geneva in 1788\u201389, independently as ''Continuation des Mille et Une Nuits'' and, in the ''Cabinet des F\u00e9es'', as ''Suites des Mille et Une Nuits''.

The following table lists the contents of Chavis's third volume.<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tale\n!Nights\n!Supposed Galland MS volume\n!Actual source\n|-\n|End of ''Qamarazzaman''\n|281-329\n|4\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 6\n|-\n|''The Sleeper Awakened''\n|330-379\n|4\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 9\n|-\n|''The Persian Physician and the Young Cook''\n|380-400\n|4\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|-\n|''The Unfortunate Youth in the Madhouse''\n|400-427\n|4\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|-\n|''Ghanim''\n|428-474\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 8\n|-\n|''[[Zayn Al-Asnam|Zayna Al-Asnam]]''\n|475-491\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 8\n|-\n|''[[Aladdin]]''\n|492-569\n|5\n|Translated into Arabic from Galland, ''Nuits'', vol. 9\n|-\n|''Baktzad'' and ''The Ten Viziers''\n|570-631\n|5\n|Copied from Arabic MS\n|}\nChavis's translation of ''Aladdin'' is particularly noteworthy. Galland's source for this story was [[Hanna Diyab]], who had apparently composed ''Aladdin'' himself and passed the tale to Galland in written form (whether in Arabic or French is not known). Since Diyab's manuscript of the story has never been found, Chavis's translation stands as the first known version of ''Aladdin'' in Arabic, and for many years scholars mistakenly thought it might represent a pre-Galland manuscript tradition of this story.<ref name=\":2\">Arafat A.

Some of Chavis's material continued to circulate in later translations of the ''Nights'', including Edouard Gauttier's of 1822\u201323.<ref name=\":6\" /> Most of its extra stories were also translated into English in the sixth supplemental volume to [[Richard Burton]]'s translation of the ''Nights'' (as nos 409-17).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===''Continuation des Mille et Une Nuits''===\nThe Switzerland-based publisher [[Paul Barde]], who was printing a massive, multi-volume anthology of fairy-tales entitled ''[[Cabinet des F\u00e9es]]'', seems to have contacted Chavis to see if he had access for further ''Nights'' material. Chavis said he did, and Barde put Chavis into collaboration with the celebrated fairy-tale writer [[Jacques Cazotte]]. Surviving correspondence suggests an awkward collaboration, in which Chavis promised to deliver material and sought money but did not entirely satisfy Cazotte and Barde. It seems that Chavis made French translations of the manuscript he had produced, along with other stories (whether in note form or complete), sent this material to Cazotte, and Cazotte variously edited or rewrote it, adding further tales of his own invention (most notably one called ''Maugraby''). The resulting text was then edited further by Barde, and published in Geneva in 1788\u201389, independently as ''Continuation des Mille et Une Nuits'' and, in the ''Cabinet des F\u00e9es'', as ''Suites des Mille et Une Nuits''. The ''Continuation'' was well received and was translated three times into English.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic-language writers]]\n[[Category:Arabic\u2013French translators]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic writers]]\n[[Category:Translators of One Thousand and One Nights]]\n[[Category:18th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:Syrian Christians]]\n[[Category:Syrian writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Chavis"}

multiple TikTok incidents that resulted in users losing their lives or severely injuring themselves while filming. According to recent data from the ''\"TikTok Death Tracker\"'' website<ref>{{cite web |title=TikTok Death Tracker |url=https://www.tiktokdeath.com/}}</ref>, there has been 48 deaths and 23 injuries since October 19, 2018. The most common types of TikToks that led to these deaths and injuries included stunts, challenges, weapons, vehicles, and suicides. The country with the highest number of casualties is India. Other countries in the count include Australia, Pakistan, Canada, USA, Brazil, and Kuwait. The most recent death on March 11, 2020, took place in India where a TikTok craze caused a newly married man to be crushed by tractor while performing a stunt in hopes to gain fame on the app. Cyberbullying via the \u2018Comments\u2019 section in TikTok also tends to cause users to develop mental conditions that have resulted in self-harm. The first death recorded on October 19, 2018, was in India as well where a Chennai youth male committed suicide from a vehicle due to being bullied for dressing up as a woman in his TikTok videos. The \"TikTok Death Tracker\" website was created to promote awareness among people in society in order to ensure users are being safe when posting and viewing content. The TikTok company claims to have a secure and safe app if users follow the terms and conditions that appear on a user's screen when creating an account. The app discourages performing dangerous stunts or challenges. However, numerous participants become victimized under the influence of popular trends and completing viral challenges on the TikTok app. The TikTok creators developed a modification in the app's algorithm to have suggested hashtags with every uploaded video to promote a more safe and aware environment.

multiple TikTok incidents that resulted in users losing their lives or severely injuring themselves while filming. According to recent data from the ''\"TikTok Death Tracker\"'' website<ref>{{cite web |title=TikTok Death Tracker |url=https://www.tiktokdeath.com/}}</ref>, there has been 48 deaths and 23 injuries since October 19, 2018. The most common types of TikToks that led to these deaths and injuries included stunts, challenges, weapons, vehicles, and suicides. The country with the highest number of casualties is India. Other countries in the count include Australia, Pakistan, Canada, USA, Brazil, and Kuwait. The most recent death on March 11, 2020, took place in India where a TikTok craze caused a newly married man to be crushed by tractor while performing a stunt in hopes to gain fame on the app. Cyberbullying via the \u2018Comments\u2019 section in TikTok also tends to cause users to develop mental conditions that have resulted in self-harm. The first death recorded on October 19, 2018, was in India as well where a Chennai youth male committed suicide from a vehicle due to being bullied for dressing up as a woman in his TikTok videos. The \"TikTok Death Tracker\" website was created to promote awareness among people in society in order to ensure users are being safe when posting and viewing content. The TikTok company claims to have a secure and safe app if users follow the terms and conditions that appear on a user's screen when creating an account. The app discourages performing dangerous stunts or challenges. However, numerous participants become victimized under the influence of popular trends and completing viral challenges on the TikTok app. The TikTok creators developed a modification in the app's algorithm to have suggested hashtags with every uploaded video to promote a more safe and aware environment. Some content may not be allowed to be uploaded if deemed inappropriate or against the terms and conditions. This restriction helps protect others from viewing disturbing content while scrolling through the main page. \u00a0\n\n<br />\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |last1=Citarella |first1=Joshua |title=Adventures in TikTok, the Wildly Popular Video App Where Gen Z Rules |work=[[Artsy]] |date=3 December 2018 |url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-tiktok-wildly-popular-video-app-gen-rules |language=en |accessdate=5 December 2018  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://www.douyin.com/ Douyin] {{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{Online social networking}}\n\n[[Category:2016 software]]\n[[Category:Bytedance]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Mobile applications]]\n[[Category:Social networking services]]\n[[Category:Video software]]\n[[Category:TikTok]]\n[[Category:Youth culture]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n", "name_user": "Vlad", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok"}
