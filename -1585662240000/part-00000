12 January 1893&nbsp;\u2013 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: [[Mulhouse|M\u00fclhausen]]) of the [[Prussian Army]] in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[M\u00fclhausen]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of [[trench warfare]]. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Nicola Perscheid - Hermann G\u00f6ring um 1918.jpg|upright|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring as a fighter pilot in 1917]]\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], G\u00f6ring was made commander of the \"Flying Circus\", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201333}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}\n\nIn the last days of the war, G\u00f6ring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when G\u00f6ring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed G\u00f6ring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After G\u00f6ring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}\n\n== Early Nazi career ==\n[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|right|upright=1.0|thumb|G\u00f6ring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin\u2014who liked Hitler\u2014often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with G\u00f6ring:\n\n{{quote|text=I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men.{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49\u201351}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8\u20139 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. G\u00f6ring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the groin.{{sfn|Holland|2011|p=54}} Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, G\u00f6ring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57\u201358}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared G\u00f6ring a wanted man. The G\u00f6rings\u2014acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad\u2014moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. G\u00f6ring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nPersonal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The G\u00f6rings\u2014with difficulty\u2014raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gda\u0144sk). G\u00f6ring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

G\u00f6ring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella.

The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, G\u00f6ring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members.

Everyone present, including G\u00f6ring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray G\u00f6ring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} When testifying on his own behalf, G\u00f6ring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359\u2013367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H.

leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: [[Mulhouse|M\u00fclhausen]]) of the [[Prussian Army]] in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[M\u00fclhausen]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of [[trench warfare]]. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Nicola Perscheid - Hermann G\u00f6ring um 1918.jpg|upright|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring as a fighter pilot in 1917]]\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], G\u00f6ring was made commander of the \"Flying Circus\", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201333}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}\n\nIn the last days of the war, G\u00f6ring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when G\u00f6ring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed G\u00f6ring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After G\u00f6ring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}\n\n== Early Nazi career ==\n[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|right|upright=1.0|thumb|G\u00f6ring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945.

G\u00f6ring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of G\u00f6ring; her son was taken by his father.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

On 18 October, Hitler named G\u00f6ring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. G\u00f6ring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella.

Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March.

By this time, G\u00f6ring's hunting lodge [[Carinhall]] had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} G\u00f6ring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that G\u00f6ring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nOKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified G\u00f6ring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify G\u00f6ring of this development. A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming G\u00f6ring his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war. The decree also gave G\u00f6ring full authority to act as Hitler's deputy if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nG\u00f6ring feared being branded a traitor if he tried to take power, but also feared being accused of dereliction of duty if he did nothing. After some hesitation, G\u00f6ring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]] (the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery), G\u00f6ring concluded that by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that under the terms of the decree, it was incumbent upon G\u00f6ring to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, G\u00f6ring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}\n\n[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann G\u00f6ring.ogv|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring after his capture (May 1945)]]\n\nThe telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that G\u00f6ring was a traitor. Bormann argued that G\u00f6ring's telegram was not a request for permission to act as Hitler's deputy, but a demand to resign or be overthrown.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}} Bormann also intercepted another telegram in which G\u00f6ring directed Ribbentrop to report to him if there was no further communication from Hitler or G\u00f6ring before midnight.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=608\u2013609}} Hitler sent a reply to G\u00f6ring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}rescinding the 1941 decree and threatening him with execution for high treason unless he immediately resigned from all of his offices. G\u00f6ring duly resigned. Afterwards, Hitler (or Bormann, depending on the source) ordered the SS to place G\u00f6ring, his staff, and Lammers under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that G\u00f6ring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}\n\nBy 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg [[Bombing of Obersalzberg|was under attack]] by the Allies, so G\u00f6ring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled G\u00f6ring from the party, formally rescinded the decree making him his successor, and upbraided G\u00f6ring for \"illegally attempting to seize control of the state.\"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1126}} He then appointed [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. G\u00f6ring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320\u2013325}} This move likely saved G\u00f6ring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}\n\n== Trial and death ==\n[[File:G\u00f6ring Detention Report mugshots.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Prisoner's \"mug shot\" taken at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice|alt=]]\n\n{{main|Nuremberg trials}}\n\nG\u00f6ring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg.

Everyone present, including G\u00f6ring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray G\u00f6ring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} When testifying on his own behalf, G\u00f6ring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359\u2013367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D. ''Collected Works of Northrop Frye''. 2006, pp 11\u201312.</ref> His visual artistry led 21st-century critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jones, Jonathan|title=Blake's heaven|work=The Guardian|location=UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,1469584,00.html|date=25 April 2005}}</ref> In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the [[BBC]]'s poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204214727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archivedate=4 December 2002|title=BBC \u2013 Great Britons \u2013 Top 100|work=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> While he lived in [[London]] his entire life, except for three years spent in [[Felpham]],<ref>Thomas, Edward.

The Nonesuch Press, 1927. p. 167.</ref>\n\nAlthough Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\".<ref>''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.</ref> A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.<ref>Blake, William. ''Blake's \"America, a Prophecy\"; And, \"Europe, a Prophecy\"''. 1984, p. 2.</ref> Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist [[Thomas Paine]]; he was also influenced by thinkers such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Kazin, Alfred | year=1997 | title=An Introduction to William Blake | url=http://www.multimedialibrary.com/Articles/kazin/alfredblake.asp | accessdate=23 September 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926013159/http://www.multimedialibrary.com/Articles/kazin/alfredblake.asp | archivedate=26 September 2006 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar [[William Michael Rossetti]] characterised him as a \"glorious luminary\",<ref>Blake, William and Rossetti, William Michael.

He was the third of seven children,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/116|title=William Blake|first=William|last=Blake|date=3 April 1999|website=William Blake|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=bent>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G.

Blake's father, James, was a [[hosier]].<ref name=bent /> He attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing, leaving at the age of ten, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake (''n\u00e9e'' Wright).<ref name=\"Raine\">{{Cite book |author=Raine, Kathleen |title=World of Art: William Blake |publisher=Thames & Hudson |year=1970 |isbn=0-500-20107-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/williamblake00rain }}</ref> Even though the Blakes were [[English Dissenters]],<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\">The Stranger From Paradise: A Biography of William Blake, Bentley (2001)</ref> William was baptised on 11 December at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's Church]], Piccadilly, London.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=2|edition=3rd}}</ref> The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life.\n\nBlake started engraving copies of drawings of [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[antiquities]] purchased for him by his father, a practice that was preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&lr=&as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.</ref> After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" /> Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]].

Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, \"I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel.\"<ref>Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1863, 405</ref>\n\n[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] gives the following account of Blake's death in a letter to [[Samuel Palmer]]:\n\n{{quote|He died ... in a most glorious manner.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P.

The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

Watercolour on wood.]]\nBlake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the \"discernment\" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels.

(E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D.

His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\".<ref>''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.</ref> A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.<ref>Blake, William.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&lr=&as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.</ref> After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" /> Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\". Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.
