In his first season, he batted a respectable .258 with 16 home runs and 63 RBI, and earned the starting position behind the plate in the Bears. Hong ended up earning KBO Rookie of the Year Award honors, becoming the first Bear since [[Yoon Suk-Hwan]] in 1984 to win the award.\n\nIn 2000, his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] rose to .290, leading the league in batting average until the All-Star break. In September, Hong was selected as a member of the [[South Korea national baseball team]] that won their first olympic medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, Australia. In the tourney, he batted .240 with a home run and 3 RBI, sharing a starting position behind the plate with [[Park Kyung-Oan]] of the [[Hyundai Unicorns]].\n\nIn 2004, Hong led the KBO league in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (165), appearing in 133 all regular season games as a starting catcher. He was third in [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.329) and fifth in [[Run batted in|RBI]] (86), smacking 14 [[home run]]s and stealing 10 [[stolen base|base]]s, and won his second Golden Glove Award as a [[catcher]].\n\nDuring the 2005 season, due to his hamstring injury and defensive deficiencies, Hong began to split his time between catching and designating hitting. After the season, he announced that he would not give up his catching position in the Bears, and his intention came into conflict with the team's manager [[Kim Kyung-Moon]].\n\nIn the beginning of the 2007 season, he was sidelined with hamstring injury, and the Bears' backup catcher [[Chae Sang-Byung]] filled Hong's void behind the plate. Hong came back as the starting catcher for the Bears in the middle of the season. His offense, however, did not perform at the level expected, as he spent the majority of the season platooning with Chae Sang-Byung, and amid much controversy the manager Kim eventually named Chae the starter for the end of the season.\n\nIn 2008, as a full-time designated hitter, Hong finished runner-up in [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with .331 and fourth in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (140). After the season, he won his third Golden Glove Award as a designated hitter.\nIn a broadcast program, which appeared after retirement, he introduced a story of his past experience with Stephen Blas' syndrome. Steven Blass syndrome refers to a syndrome in which a baseball player suffers from poor control, such as a sudden strike. It is a term derived from a real example of Steve Blas, a right-hander who led Pittsburgh to the World Series title in 1971. Hong Sung-heun's frequent defensive errors at the time were also due to skills problems caused by suffering from Steven Blas syndrome.\n[http://sports.chosun.com/news/ntype.htm?id=201501160100187590011377&servicedate=20150116]</ref>\n\n=== Lotte Giants ===\nHong became a [[free agent]] after the 2008 season and signed a four-year deal with the [[Lotte Giants]] on November 27, 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Hong was runner-up in [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] again with a career-high .371, only .001 behind league-leader [[Park Yong-Taik]] of the [[LG Twins]].
