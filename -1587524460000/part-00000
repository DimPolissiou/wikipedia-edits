During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV. Crisp defied convention by criticising both [[gay liberation]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n'''Denis Charles Pratt''' was born in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], South London, on [[Christmas Day]] 1908, the fourth child of solicitor Spencer Charles Pratt (1871\u20131931) and former [[governess]] Frances Marion Pratt (n\u00e9e Phillips; 1873\u20131960).<ref>1911 Census for England and Wales, The National Archives (findmypast.co.uk): RG number: RG14; Piece: 2929; Reference: RG14PN2929, RG78PN101; Registration District: Epsom; Sub District: Carshalton; Enumeration District: 7; Parish: Carshalton; Address: Wolverton, Egmont Road, Sutton; County: Surrey.</ref> Her elder siblings were Katherine (1901\u20131976), Gerald (1902\u20131983) and Lewis (1907\u20131968). She changed her name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in her twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy her own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in her demeanour from an early age resulting in her being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which she won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 her favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months she worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} she said she was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where she \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Her \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 she wore bright make-up, dyed her long hair crimson, painted her fingernails, and wore sandals to display her painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing her in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". He remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired his love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, he moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that he occupied until he emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years he never attempted any housework, writing famously in his memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left his job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. He continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time he came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of his agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which he was expected to talk about his life, voice his opinions and sit around in his flat filing his nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for his book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp himself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. He devised a one-man show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on his memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen his autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said he had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that he was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: his one-man show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. He then took the show to New York. His first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, he arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Mr. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs he had done in London, Crisp allowed his telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as his duty to converse with anyone who called him. For the first twenty or so years of owning his own telephone, he habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" he once said.) Later on, he changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. His openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst he expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did his best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling his host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as he did in his theatrical performances. Dinner with him was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHe continued to perform his one-man show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which he claimed is socially exclusive), and supported himself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. He said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from his jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of his one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. He made his debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. He subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought him into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, he was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one he dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be his most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered him roles. In 1992, he was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although he found the role taxing, he won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while his last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. He caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> He was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s his commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. He stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], he commented that it was perhaps her \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In his third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that he was close to the end of his life, though he continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year he was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. He presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that he was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before his death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of his left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and his move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it he recounts several previously untold stories from his life, walks the reader through his journey from obscurity, and reflects on his philosophy. He also describes the realisation that he was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares his views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of his one-man show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and his collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ...

The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''.

During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV. Crisp defied convention by criticising both [[gay liberation]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n'''Denis Charles Pratt''' was born in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], South London, on [[Christmas Day]] 1908, the fourth child of solicitor Spencer Charles Pratt (1871\u20131931) and former [[governess]] Frances Marion Pratt (n\u00e9e Phillips; 1873\u20131960).<ref>1911 Census for England and Wales, The National Archives (findmypast.co.uk): RG number: RG14; Piece: 2929; Reference: RG14PN2929, RG78PN101; Registration District: Epsom; Sub District: Carshalton; Enumeration District: 7; Parish: Carshalton; Address: Wolverton, Egmont Road, Sutton; County: Surrey.</ref> His elder siblings were Katherine (1901\u20131976), Gerald (1902\u20131983) and Lewis (1907\u20131968). He changed his name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in his twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy his own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in his demeanour from an early age resulting in him being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which he won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 his favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting other young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months he worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} he said he was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where he \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 he wore bright make-up, dyed his long hair crimson, painted his fingernails and wore sandals to display his painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing him in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". He remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired his love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, he moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that he occupied until he emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years he never attempted any housework, writing famously in his memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left his job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. He continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time he came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of his agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which he was expected to talk about his life, voice his opinions and sit around in his flat filing his nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for his book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp himself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. He devised a one-man show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on his memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen his autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said he had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that he was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: his one-man show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. He then took the show to New York. His first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, he arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Mr. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs he had done in London, Crisp allowed his telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as his duty to converse with anyone who called him. For the first twenty or so years of owning his own telephone, he habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" he once said.) Later on, he changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. His openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst he expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did his best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling his host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as he did in his theatrical performances. Dinner with him was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHe continued to perform his one-man show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which he claimed is socially exclusive), and supported himself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. He said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from his jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of his one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. He made his debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. He subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought him into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, he was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one he dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be his most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered him roles. In 1992, he was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although he found the role taxing, he won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while his last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. He caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> He was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s his commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. He stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], he commented that it was perhaps her \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In his third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that he was close to the end of his life, though he continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year he was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. He presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that he was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before his death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of his left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and his move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it he recounts several previously untold stories from his life, walks the reader through his journey from obscurity, and reflects on his philosophy. He also describes the realisation that he was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares his views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of his one-man show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and his collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ... All Things Quentin Crisp!  -  UNCLE DENIS? - a film by Adrian Goycoolea|website=www.crisperanto.org}}</ref> at the 23rd [[London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival]]. The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''. The retrospective consisted of free screenings of interviews, one man shows, documentaries and other recorded media.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp |url=http://madmuseum.org/series/ladies-and-gentlemen-mr-quentin-crisp |website=Museum of Arts and Design |publisher=Museum of Arts and Design |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Mark Farrelly's solo performance ''Quentin Crisp: Naked Hope'' debuted at the Edinburgh Festival, before transferring to the [[The Other Palace|St. James's Theatre]] in London and subsequently touring. It depicts Crisp at his Chelsea flat in the 1960s and performing his one-man show thirty years later.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://markfarrelly.co.uk/portfolio/quentin-crisp/|website=Mark Farrelly|title=Quentin Crisp: Naked Hope|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016 [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|''Ghostbusters'' reboot]], [[Bill Murray]] explicitly based the dress style of his character (Martin Heiss) on Crisp.<ref>{{ cite DVD notes | title=Ghostbusters: Answer the Call DVD | year=2016 | type=Both Commentary Tracks | others=Paul Feig }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* ''Lettering for Brush and Pen'' (1936), Quentin Crisp and A.F.

This includes problem-solving, decision-making, and apparent [[precognitive dreams|precognition while dreaming]]. These phenomena have been interpreted in various ways.\n\n==Notable dreams==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Abraham Lincoln===  \n\nThree days prior to his assassination [[Abraham Lincoln]] related a prophetic dream he had to his wife and a few friends foreshadowing his death. According to the recollection of his loyal friend and confidant [[Ward Hill Lamon]], President Abraham Lincoln dreams on this night in 1865 of \u201cthe subdued sobs of mourners\". Walking from room to room he noticed a corpse lying on a [[catafalque]] in the White House East Room. In the dream, Lincoln asked a soldier standing guard \u201cWho is dead in the White House?\u201d to which the soldier replied, \u201cThe President. He was killed by an assassin.\u201d Lincoln jumped out of bed at that point on April 11. Ten days after his vivid nightmare, Lincoln was shot dead at point blank range by an assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] while attending the theater.<ref>https://www.dreamdictionary.org/dreaming/abraham-lincoln-predicted-his-death/</ref>\n\n===Frankenstein===\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was inspired by a dream:\n{{quote|\"I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous Creator of the world.\"{{ref|shel}}}}\n\n===Kubla Khan===\n[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' upon awakening from an opium-influenced dream. In a preface to the work, he described having the poem come to him, fully formed, in his dream. When he woke, he immediately set to writing it down, but was interrupted by a visitor and could not remember the final lines. For this reason, he kept it unpublished for many years.\n\n===The sewing machine===\n[[Elias Howe]] invented the [[sewing machine]] in 1845. He had the idea of a machine with a needle which would go through a piece of cloth but he couldn't figure out exactly how it would work. In his dream, cannibals were preparing to cook him and they were dancing around the fire waving their spears. Howe noticed at the head of each spear there was a small hole through the shaft and the up-and-down motion of the spears and the hole remained with him when he woke. The idea of passing the thread through the needle close to the point, not at the other end, was a major innovation in making mechanical sewing possible. {{ref|sew}}\n\n===The Terminator===\nDirector [[James Cameron]] said the titular character in ''[The Terminator]]'' was inspired by a dream he had under the influence of a soaring [[fever]]. It was a vivid dream where a gleaming figure of doom emerged from fire; a metallic, skeletal monster with a rictus smile and burning red eyes, dragging itself across the floor with [[kitchen knives]]. He states: \"I was sick and dead broke in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], with a fever of 102, doing the final cut of [[Piranha II]]. That's when I thought of Terminator.

A psychiatrist advised him to stop making comics and take a rest, but Herg\u00e9 drew an entire story set in a white environment: the snowy mountaintops of [[Tibet]]. ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' (1960) not only stopped his nightmares and worked as a therapeutic experience, but the work is also regarded as one of his masterpieces.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Art of Herg\u00e9, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 3: 1950-1983 |last=Goddin |first=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Goddin |others=Michael Farr (translator) |year=2011 |publisher=Last Gasp |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-86719-763-1 |page=108}}</ref>\n\n===Over the Garden Wall - Chapter 5===\nChapter 5 of the series, \"Mad Love\", was inspired by a dream show creator [[Patrick McHale (artist)|Patrick McHale]] had. In the events of the dream, Pat was house hunting and came across a secret library in one of the houses. As he explored further, he realized that he had entered someone else's home. In the episode, the character Quincy Endicott explores his mansion, and discovers that he has entered the mansion of his neighbour.\n\n===Prophetic dreams===\nSeveral historical people have experienced dreams which they believed to be warnings that they were to die after they woke up.\n\nNew York lawyer Isaac Frauenthal had a dream before boarding the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. \u201cIt seemed to me that I was on a big steamship that suddenly crashed into something and began to go down.\u201d He had the dream again when on board the Titanic, and was alert to the danger when he heard about the iceberg collision. Frauenthal survived the sinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wormstedt.com/GeorgeBehe/page9.htm|title=Psychic Forewarnings of a Tragedy?|website=wormstedt.com|accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Niels Bohr's structure of the atom ===\n[[Niels Bohr]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1922 for his discovery of the structure of the atom. He recalled that the electrons revolving around the nucleus, like the solar system, came to him in a dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allaboutheaven.org/sources/bohr-niels/190|title=Bohr, Niels|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> Upon testing his \"dream\" hypothesis, he was able to discover that the atomic structure was, in fact, similar to it.\n\n=== Mendeleev's Periodic Table ===\n[[Dmitri Mendeleev]], who created the periodic table foundational to our understanding of chemistry, claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream. While struggling to correctly orient the elements he recalls seeing them in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, he immediately wrote them down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.\n\n\n==Explanations==\n\n===As divination===\n{{further|Precognition#In dreams}}\nA way of understanding this phenomenon is that some dreams are messages from a god, or the future. This belief has been held by many military leaders (such as [[Hannibal]]) who planned battles from dreams, and Descartes, who changed the course of his life after his scientific dream. According to [[Carl Jung]],<ref>Jung, C.G., \"On the Nature of the Psyche\", Princeton University Press, 1960</ref> [[energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]] might be operative.\n\nAn early\u2014and perhaps the first formal\u2014inquiry into this phenomenon was done by Aristotle in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. His criticism of these claims appeals to the fact that \"the sender of such dreams should be God\", and \"the fact that those to whom he sends them are not the best and wisest, but merely commonplace persons.\" Thus \"Most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere coincidences\".{{ref|aris}}\n\n===Subconscious===\nThe psychological role that dreams play is not fully understood. These events have been interpreted as evidence that dreams play some sort of organizing function, sorting out thoughts had during the day.  \nThis theory suggests that dreaming is an \"unlearning process\" in which our brains bring up material to be thrown out like a computer attempting to clean itself of things we do not need to remember. That is, the [[subconscious]] organizes things, solves these problems, and then communicates them to the individual via a dream. (see [[Dream interpretation]]) The [[hypnagogic]] state is sometimes proposed as a specific explanation of experiences such as alien abduction, apparitions, or visions.\n\n===As coincidence===\n{{main|Activation synthesis theory}}\nAnother way to describe this phenomenon is to claim that dreams are random, but the individuals have been lucky enough to interpret their dreams in an allegorical way relevant to a problem they need to solve.\nDream researcher Ernest Hartman comments on current dream theories proposed by biologists. One such theory suggests that dreams are basically random nonsense and are the product of a poorly functioning brain during sleep. If there is any meaning to dreams, it is added on later as our brains try to make the best of a bad job.\n\nThus the predictive value of dreams is moot.<ref>Hartman, Ernest, MD, \"Biology of Dreaming\", Charles C. Thomas Publications Ltd, 1997</ref><ref>Hartman, Ernest, MD, \"Boundaries In The Mind\" New York, Basic Books, 2002</ref>\n\nDreams which appear to be precognitive may in fact be the result of the \"Law of Large Numbers\". [[Robert Todd Carroll]], author of ''The Skeptic's Dictionary'' put it this way:\n{{quote|\"Say the odds are a million to one that when a person has a dream of an airplane crash, there is an airplane crash the next day. With 6 billion people having an average of 250 dream themes each per night, there should be about 1.5 million people a day who have dreams that seem clairvoyant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/lawofnumbers.html|title=law of truly large numbers - coincidence - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>}}\n \nIn his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', first published at the end of the 19th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] argued that the foundation of all dream content is the fulfillment of wishes, conscious or not and devoid of [[psychic]] content. Some of Freud's patients and their strange dreams have become well-known case studies in [[psychotherapy]], like [[Irma's injection]], [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]], and [[Dora (case study)|Dora]]. In his discussions with [[Carl Jung]], Freud referred to [[parapsychology]] and [[precognition]] as \"nonsensical.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tetris effect|''Tetris'' effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{note|shel}} Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, from her introduction to ''[[Frankenstein]]''\n* {{note|sew}} A Popular History of American Invention.

In the episode, the character Quincy Endicott explores his mansion, and discovers that he has entered the mansion of his neighbour.\n\n===Prophetic dreams===\nSeveral historical people have experienced dreams which they believed to be warnings that they were to die after they woke up.\n\nNew York lawyer Isaac Frauenthal had a dream before boarding the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. \u201cIt seemed to me that I was on a big steamship that suddenly crashed into something and began to go down.\u201d He had the dream again when on board the Titanic, and was alert to the danger when he heard about the iceberg collision. Frauenthal survived the sinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wormstedt.com/GeorgeBehe/page9.htm|title=Psychic Forewarnings of a Tragedy?|website=wormstedt.com|accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Niels Bohr's structure of the atom ===\n[[Niels Bohr]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1922 for his discovery of the structure of the atom. He recalled that the electrons revolving around the nucleus, like the solar system, came to him in a dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allaboutheaven.org/sources/bohr-niels/190|title=Bohr, Niels|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> Upon testing his \"dream\" hypothesis, he was able to discover that the atomic structure was, in fact, similar to it.\n\n=== Mendeleev's Periodic Table ===\n[[Dmitri Mendeleev]], who created the periodic table foundational to our understanding of chemistry, claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream. While struggling to correctly orient the elements he recalls seeing them in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, he immediately wrote them down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.\n\n\n==Explanations==\n\n===As divination===\n{{further|Precognition#In dreams}}\nA way of understanding this phenomenon is that some dreams are messages from a god, or the future. This belief has been held by many military leaders (such as [[Hannibal]]) who planned battles from dreams, and Descartes, who changed the course of his life after his scientific dream. According to [[Carl Jung]],<ref>Jung, C.G., \"On the Nature of the Psyche\", Princeton University Press, 1960</ref> [[energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]] might be operative.\n\nAn early\u2014and perhaps the first formal\u2014inquiry into this phenomenon was done by Aristotle in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. His criticism of these claims appeals to the fact that \"the sender of such dreams should be God\", and \"the fact that those to whom he sends them are not the best and wisest, but merely commonplace persons.\" Thus \"Most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere coincidences\".{{ref|aris}}\n\n===Subconscious===\nThe psychological role that dreams play is not fully understood. These events have been interpreted as evidence that dreams play some sort of organizing function, sorting out thoughts had during the day.  \nThis theory suggests that dreaming is an \"unlearning process\" in which our brains bring up material to be thrown out like a computer attempting to clean itself of things we do not need to remember. That is, the [[subconscious]] organizes things, solves these problems, and then communicates them to the individual via a dream. (see [[Dream interpretation]]) The [[hypnagogic]] state is sometimes proposed as a specific explanation of experiences such as alien abduction, apparitions, or visions.\n\n===As coincidence===\n{{main|Activation synthesis theory}}\nAnother way to describe this phenomenon is to claim that dreams are random, but the individuals have been lucky enough to interpret their dreams in an allegorical way relevant to a problem they need to solve.\nDream researcher Ernest Hartman comments on current dream theories proposed by biologists. One such theory suggests that dreams are basically random nonsense and are the product of a poorly functioning brain during sleep. If there is any meaning to dreams, it is added on later as our brains try to make the best of a bad job.\n\nThus the predictive value of dreams is moot.<ref>Hartman, Ernest, MD, \"Biology of Dreaming\", Charles C. Thomas Publications Ltd, 1997</ref><ref>Hartman, Ernest, MD, \"Boundaries In The Mind\" New York, Basic Books, 2002</ref>\n\nDreams which appear to be precognitive may in fact be the result of the \"Law of Large Numbers\". [[Robert Todd Carroll]], author of ''The Skeptic's Dictionary'' put it this way:\n{{quote|\"Say the odds are a million to one that when a person has a dream of an airplane crash, there is an airplane crash the next day. With 6 billion people having an average of 250 dream themes each per night, there should be about 1.5 million people a day who have dreams that seem clairvoyant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/lawofnumbers.html|title=law of truly large numbers - coincidence - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>}}\n \nIn his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', first published at the end of the 19th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] argued that the foundation of all dream content is the fulfillment of wishes, conscious or not and devoid of [[psychic]] content. Some of Freud's patients and their strange dreams have become well-known case studies in [[psychotherapy]], like [[Irma's injection]], [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]], and [[Dora (case study)|Dora]]. In his discussions with [[Carl Jung]], Freud referred to [[parapsychology]] and [[precognition]] as \"nonsensical.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tetris effect|''Tetris'' effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{note|shel}} Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, from her introduction to ''[[Frankenstein]]''\n* {{note|sew}} A Popular History of American Invention.

Considered a leading composer of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and early [[20th-century classical music|modern]] eras, he has been described as a successor of [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Franz Liszt]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> Along with [[Gustav Mahler]], he represents the late flowering of [[German Romanticism]] after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of [[orchestration]] are combined with an advanced [[harmony|harmonic]] style.\n\nStrauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with [[tone poem]]s and [[opera]]s. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1890), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1905), and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) which used a libretto by [[Hedwig Lachmann]] that was a German translation of the French play ''[[Salome (play)|Salom\u00e9]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]: ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). His last operas, ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1938), ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938), ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942) used libretti written by [[Joseph Gregor]], the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, [[lied]]er (especially his ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' from 1948),  the [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882), the [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883), [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1943),  his [[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]] and other instrumental works such as ''[[Metamorphosen]]'' (1945).\n\nStrauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar]] from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducting Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with his wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the [[Berlin State Opera]] from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]], and in 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]]. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally.\n\nIn 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of [[Nazi Germany]]: head of the [[Reichsmusikkammer]] and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera ''Friedenstag'', which premiered just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.\n\n==Early life and career (1864\u20131886)==\n[[File:Richard Strauss 20OCT1886.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strauss aged 22]]\nStrauss was born on 11 June 1864 in [[Munich]], the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Pschorr) and [[Franz Strauss]], who was the principal [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] player at the Court Opera in Munich and a professor at the [[K\u00f6nigliche Musikschule]].<ref name=\"g1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Richard_Strauss.aspx|title=Richard Strauss facts, information, pictures|website=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> His mother was the daughter of Georg Pschorr, a financially prosperous [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|brewer from Munich]].<ref name=\"g1\">{{harvnb|Gilliam|Youmans|2001}}</ref>\n\nStrauss began his musical studies at the age of four, studying piano with August Tombo who was the harpist in the Munich Court Orchestra.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He soon after began attending the rehearsals of the orchestra, and began getting lessons in music theory and orchestration from the ensemble's assistant conductor. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction from [[Benno Walter]], the director of the Munich Court Orchestra and his father's cousin, and at 11 began five years of compositional study with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1882 he graduated from the Ludwigsgymnasium and afterwards attended only one year at the [[University of Munich]] in 1882\u20131883.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn addition to his formal teachers, Strauss was profoundly influenced musically by his father who made instrumental music-making central to the Strauss home. The Strauss family was frequently joined in their home for music making, meals, and other activities by the orphaned composer and music theorist [[Ludwig Thuille]] who was viewed as an adopted member of the family.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Strauss's father taught his son the music of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further assisted his son with his musical composition during the 1870s and into the early 1880s, providing advice, comments, and criticisms.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further provided support by showcasing his sons compositions in performance with the \u2018Wilde Gung'l\u2019, an amateur orchestra he conducted from 1875\u20131896. Many of his early symphonic compositions were written for this ensemble.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His compositions at this time were indebted to the style of [[Robert Schumann]] or [[Felix Mendelssohn]], true to his father's teachings. His father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn. His [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]], is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1874, Strauss heard his first [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1878 he attended performances of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' and ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' in Munich, and in 1879 he attended performances of the entire ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of ''Tristan und Isolde''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1882 he went to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to hear his father perform in the world premiere of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]''; after which surviving letters to his father and to Thuille detail his seemingly negative impression of Wagner and his music.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works.<ref name=\"B\">{{harvnb|Boyden|1999|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1882, in Vienna, Strauss gave the first performance of his [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]], playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] as assistant conductor to [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's ''Serenade (Op. 7)'' for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing B\u00fclow in rehearsal. B\u00fclow was very fond of the young man, and Strauss considered him as his greatest conducting mentor, often crediting him as teaching him \"the art of interpretation\".<ref name=\"g1\"/> Notably, under B\u00fclow's baton he made his first major appearance as a concert pianist, performing Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], for which he composed his own [[cadenza]]s.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1885, B\u00fclow unexpectedly resigned from his post, and Strauss was left to lead the Meiningen Court Orchestra as interim principal conductor for the remainder of the artistic season through April 1886.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He notably helped prepare the orchestra for the world premiere performance of [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]], which Brahms himself conducted. He also conducted his [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] for Brahms, who advised Strauss: \"Your symphony contains too much playing about with themes. This piling up of many themes based on a triad, which differ from one another only in rhythm, has no value.\"<ref name=\"g1\"/> Brahms' music, like Wagner's, also left a tremendous impression upon Strauss, and he often referred to this time of his life as his \u2018Brahmsschw\u00e4rmerei\u2019 (\u2018Brahms adoration\u2019) during which several his compositions clearly show Brahms' influence, including ''Wandrers Sturmlied'' (1884) and ''Burleske'' (1885\u201386).\"<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\n==Strauss finds success in conducting and tone poems (1885\u20131898)==\n[[File:Pauline Strauss de Ahna.jpg|thumb|Pauline de Ahna Strauss, c. 1900]]\nIn 1885 Strauss met the composer [[Alexander Ritter]] who was a violinist in the Meiningen orchestra and the husband of one of [[Richard Wagner]]'s nieces. An avid champion of the ideals of Wagner and [[Franz Liszt]], Ritter had a tremendous impact on the trajectory of Strauss' work as a composer from 1885 onward. Ritter convinced Strauss to abandon his more conservative style of composing and embrace the \"music of the future\" by modeling his compositional style off of Wagner and Liszt.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He further influenced Strauss by engaging him in studies and conversations on the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Wagner, and Friedrich von Hausegger. All of this together gave a new aesthetic anchor to Strauss which first became evident in his embrace of the [[tone poem]] genre.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter leaving his post in Meiningen in 1886, Strauss spent several weeks traveling throughout Italy before assuming a new post as third conductor at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] (then known as the Munich Hofoper). While traveling he wrote down descriptions of the various sites he was seeing along with tonal impressions that went with those descriptions. These he communicated in a letter to his mother, and they ultimately were used as the beginning of his first [[tone poem]], ''[[Aus Italien]]'' (1886).<ref name=\"g1\" /> Shortly after Strauss assumed his opera conducting duties in Munich, Ritter himself moved to the city in September 1886. For the next three years the two men would meet regularly, often joined by Thuille and [[Anton Seidl]], in order to discuss music, particularly Wagner and Liszt, and discuss poetry, literature, and philosophy.<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\nStrauss's tenure at the Bavarian State Opera was not a happy one. With the death of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] in June 1886, the opera house was not as well financially supported by his successor [[Otto of Bavaria]] which meant that much of the more ambitious and expensive repertoire that he wanted to stage, such as Wagner's operas, were unfeasible. The opera assignments he was given, works by Boieldieu, Auber and Donizetti, bored him, and to make matters worse Hermann Levi, the senior conductor at the house, was often ill and Strauss was required to step in at the last minute to conduct performance for operas which he had never rehearsed. This caused problems for him, the singers, and the orchestra. During this time, Strauss did find much more enjoyable conducting work outside Munich in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. In the latter city he met and befriended the composer [[Gustav Mahler]] in the autumn of 1887. Also happily, Strauss met his future wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], in 1887. De Ahna was then a voice student at the [[Munich Musikschule]], but soon switched to private lessons with Strauss who became her principal teacher.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn May 1889 Strauss left his post with the Bavarian State Opera after being appointed [[Kapellmeister]] to [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in Weimar, beginning in the Autumn of 1889. During the Summer of 1889 he served as the assistant conductor of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] during which time he befriended [[Cosima Wagner]] who became a longterm close friend.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Pauline De Ahna went with Strauss to Weimar and he later married her on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of 1948, he preferred the [[soprano|soprano voice]] to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles. In Weimar she created the role of Freihild in Strauss's first opera, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'', in 1894. The opera was received with mixed reviews in Weimar, but its later production in Munich was met with scorn and was Strauss's first major failure.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n[[File:Strauss Haus Garmisch.JPG|thumb|Strauss villa at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. Built 1906. Architect: Emanuel Seidl.]]\nIn spite of the failure of his first opera, Strauss's tenure in Weimar brought about several important successes for his career. His tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' premiered in Weimar on 11 November 1889 to tremendous critical response, and the work quickly brought him international fame and success. This was followed by another lauded achievement, the premiere of his tone poem ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' in 1890. Both of these works, along with the earlier ''Burleske'', became internationally known and established him as a leading modernist composer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also had much success as a conductor in Weimar, particularly with the symphonic poems of Liszt and an uncut production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' in 1892.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn the Summer of 1894 Strauss made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user'' with Pauline singing Elisabeth. Just prior to their marriage the following September, Strauss left his post in Weimar when he was appointed Kapellmeister, or first conductor, of the Bavarian State Opera where he became responsible for the operas of Wagner. While working in Munich for the next four years he had his largest creative period period of tone poem composition, producing ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1894\u20131895.

By this time in his career, he was in constant demand as a guest conductor internationally and enjoyed celebrity status as a conductor; particularly in the works of Wagner, Mozart, and Liszt in addition to his own compositions.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He became president of the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein]] in 1901, and that same year became leader of the [[Berliner Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as editor of the book series ''Die Musik''. He used all of these posts to champion contemporary German composers like Mahler. His own compositions were becoming increasingly popular, and the first major orchestra to perform an entire concert of only his music was the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1901.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1903 Strauss Festivals dedicated to his music were established in London and Heidelberg. At the latter festival his cantata ''[[Taillefer (Strauss)|Taillefer]]'' was given its world premiere.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1904 Strauss embarked on his first North American tour, with stops in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Pittsburgh. At [[Carnegie Hall]] he conducted the world premiere of his ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' on March 21, 1904 with the [[Wetzler Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Wetzler\">{{cite news|title=Herman Wetzler, Composer, 72, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 30, 1943|page=26}}</ref> He also conducted several other works in collaboration with composer [[Hermann Hans Wetzler]] and his orchestra that year at Carnegie Hall, and also performed a concert of leider with his wife.<ref name=\"Wetzler\"/> During this trip he was working intensively on composing his third opera, ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', based on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1891 play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. The work, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, became Strauss's greatest triumph in his career up to that point, and opera houses all over the world quickly began programing the opera.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter ''Salome'', Strauss had a string of critically successful operas which he created with the librettist and poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. These operas included ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933).<ref name=\"g1\"/> While all of these works remain part of the opera repertoire, his opera ''Der Rosenkavalier'' is generally considered his finest achievement.<ref name=\"g1\"/> During this time he continued to work internationally as a celebrity conductor, and from 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]] with Reinhardt and the set designer Alfred Rolle. In 1924 Strauss's opera ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' premiered at the [[Semperoper|Dresden Semperoper]] with both the music and the libretto by Strauss. For this opera, Strauss wanted to move away from post-Wagnerian metaphysics which had been the philosophical framework of Hofmannsthal's libretti, and instead embrace a modern domestic comedy to Hofmannsthal's chagrin.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The work proved to be a success.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1924 Strauss's son Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsw\u00f6rth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Strauss in Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)==\n\n===''Reichsmusikkammer''===\nIn March 1933, when Strauss was 68, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rose to power]]. Strauss never joined the Nazi party, and studiously avoided [[Nazi salute|Nazi forms of greeting]]. For reasons of expediency, however, he was initially drawn into cooperating with the early Nazi regime in the hope that Hitler\u2014an ardent Wagnerian and music lover who had admired Strauss' work since viewing ''Salome'' in 1907\u2014would promote German art and culture. Strauss's need to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren also motivated his behavior,<ref name=\"g1\" /> in addition to his determination to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Claude Debussy]].\n\nIn 1933, Strauss wrote in his private notebook:\n<blockquote>I consider the [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]]-Goebbels Jew-baiting as a disgrace to German honour, as evidence of incompetence\u2014the basest weapon of untalented, lazy mediocrity against a higher intelligence and greater talent.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 274.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, far from being an admirer of Strauss's work, [[Joseph Goebbels]] maintained expedient cordiality with Strauss only for a period. Goebbels wrote in his diary:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately we still need him, but one day we shall have our own music and then we shall have no further need of this decadent neurotic.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 293</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Strauss Time 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss was on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' in 1927 and (here) 1938]]\nNevertheless, because of Strauss's international eminence, in November 1933 he was appointed to the post of president of the newly founded ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', the Reich Music Chamber. Strauss, who had lived through numerous political regimes and had no interest in politics, decided to accept the position but to remain apolitical, a decision which would eventually become untenable. He wrote to his family, \"I made music under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]], and under [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]]. I'll survive under this one as well.\"<ref name=em/> In 1935 he wrote in his journal:\n<blockquote>In November 1933, the minister Goebbels nominated me president of the ''Reichsmusikkammer'' without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, \"reorganized\" by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers.<ref name=em>Quoted on [http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/151/strauss-richard ''[[Exploring Music]]'' (2004) on the WFMT Radio Network; Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\"], first aired 9 January 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nStrauss privately scorned Goebbels and called him \"a pipsqueak\".<ref>Reuth 1993, p. 402</ref> However, in 1933 he dedicated an orchestral song, \"''Das B\u00e4chlein''\" (\"The Little Brook\"), to Goebbels, in order to gain his cooperation in extending German music copyright laws from 30 years to 50 years.<ref>Kennedy 1999, pp. 281\u2013282</ref> Also in 1933, he replaced [[Arturo Toscanini]] as director of the Bayreuth Festival after Toscanini had resigned in protest to the Nazi regime.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nStrauss attempted to ignore Nazi bans on performances of works by Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. He also continued to work on a comic opera, ''Die schweigsame Frau'', with his Jewish friend and librettist Stefan Zweig. When the opera was premiered in Dresden in 1935, Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appear on the theatrical billing, much to the ire of the Nazi regime. Hitler and Goebbels avoided attending the opera, and it was halted after three performances and subsequently banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 285</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1935, Strauss wrote a letter to Stefan Zweig, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>Do you believe I am ever, in any of my actions, guided by the thought that I am 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was consciously 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent and those who have none.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis letter to Zweig was intercepted by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to Hitler. Strauss was subsequently [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from his post as ''Reichsmusikkammer'' president in 1935. The [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]] nevertheless used Strauss's ''[[Olympische Hymne]]'', which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, \"To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I put it back on again\", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the ''Reichsmusikkammer''.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (1978), Review of \"A Confidential Matter: The Letters of Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig, 1931\u20131935\" in ''[[Music & Letters]]'', Vol.&nbsp;59, No.&nbsp;4, October 1978. pp.&nbsp;472\u2013475.</ref> Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 316</ref>\n\n===Operas with Joseph Gregor and work to save his Jewish daughter-in-law ===\n[[File:Strauss 1938.jpg|thumb|240px|Strauss at Garmisch in 1938]]\nFrustrated that he could no longer work with Zweig as his librettist, Strauss turned to [[Joseph Gregor]], a Viennese theatre historian, at Gregor's request. The first opera they worked on together was ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', but it ultimately became the second of their operas to be premiered. Their first work to be staged was in 1938, when the entire nation was preparing for war, they presented ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (''Peace Day''), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The work is essentially a hymn to peace and a thinly veiled criticism of the Third Reich. With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]''. Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men collaborated on two more operas which proved to be Strauss's last: ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nWhen his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice was placed under house arrest in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in 1938, Strauss used his connections in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant [[Heinz Tietjen]], to secure her safety. He drove to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in order to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, for the release of Alice's grandmother, Paula Neumann. In the end, Neumann and 25 other relatives were murdered in the camps.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/06/arts/music-richard-strauss-and-hitler-s-reich-jupiter-in-hell.html \"Music; Richard Strauss and Hitler's Reich: Jupiter in Hell\"] by [[Michael Hans Kater]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 January 2002</ref> While Alice's mother, Marie von Grab, was safe in Lucerne, Switzerland, Strauss also wrote several letters to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 339</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Strauss moved with his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her children could be protected by [[Baldur von Schirach]], the [[Gauleiter]] of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and his son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, and he was able to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n===''Metamorphosen'' and apprehension by USA troops===\nStrauss completed the composition of ''[[Metamorphosen]]'', a work for 23 solo strings, in 1945. The title and inspiration for the work comes from a profoundly self-examining poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], which Strauss had considered setting as a choral work.<ref name=Ross338>Ross (2009), p. 338</ref> Generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of the string repertoire, ''Metamorphosen'' contains Strauss's most sustained outpouring of tragic emotion. Conceived and written during the blackest days of [[World War II]], the piece expresses Strauss's mourning of, among other things, the destruction of German culture\u2014including the bombing of every great opera house in the nation. At the end of the war, Strauss wrote in his private diary:\n<blockquote>The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2000 years of cultural evolution met its doom.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 361</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1945, Strauss was apprehended by American soldiers at his Garmisch estate. As he descended the staircase he announced to Lieutenant Milton Weiss of the U.S. Army, \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer of ''Rosenkavalier'' and ''Salome''.\" Lt. Weiss, who was also a musician, nodded in recognition. An \"Off Limits\" sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss.<ref>Ross 2009, p. 373</ref> The American oboist [[John de Lancie (oboist)|John de Lancie]], who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto. Initially dismissive of the idea, Strauss completed this late work, his ''[[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]]'', before the end of the year.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n==Creative surge in latter years and death (1942\u20131949)==\nThe metaphor \"[[Indian summer|Indian Summer]]\" is often used by journalists, biographers, and music critics to describe Strauss's late creative upsurge from 1942 to the end of his life. The events of World War II seemed to bring the composer\u2014who had grown old, tired, and a little jaded\u2014into focus.<ref>[[Bill McGlaughlin|McGlaughlin, Bill]]. ''[[Exploring Music]]'', [http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/151/strauss-richard Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\"], first aired 9 January 2004.</ref> The major works of the last years of Strauss's life, written in his late 70s and 80s, include, among others, his ''[[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]]'', ''[[Metamorphosen]]'', his ''[[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]]'', his ''[[Duet concertino for clarinet and bassoon|Duet Concertino for clarinet and bassoon]]'', and his ''[[Four Last Songs]]''.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nLike most Germans, Strauss's bank accounts were frozen and many of his assets seized by American forces. Now elderly and with very few resources remaining, Strauss and his wife left Germany for Switzerland in October 1945 where they settled in a hotel just outside Z\u00fcrich. There they met the Swiss music critic [[Willi Schuh (musicologist)|Willy Schuh]], who became Strauss's biographer. Strapped for cash, in 1947 Strauss embarked on his last international tour, a three-week trip to London, in which he conducted several of his tone poems and excerpts of his operas, and was present during a complete staging of ''Elektra'' by the [[BBC]]. The trip was a critical success and provided him and his wife with some much needed money.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nFrom May\u2013September 1948, just before his death, Strauss composed the ''Four Last Songs'' which deal with the subject of dying. The last one, \"Im Abendrot\" (At Sunset), ends with the line \"Is this perhaps death?\" The question is not answered in words, but instead Strauss quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his earlier tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''\u2014meant to symbolize the transfiguration and fulfilment of the soul after death. In June 1948, he was cleared of any wrong-doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.<ref name=\"g1\"/> That same month he orchestrated ''[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]'', a song that he had originally composed in 1894.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1948 Strauss was hospitalized for several weeks after undergoing bladder surgery.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His health rapidly deteriorated after that, and he conducted his last performance, the end of Act 2 of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the [[Prinzregententheater]] in Munich, during celebrations of his 85th birthday on June 10, 1949. On August 15 he suffered from a [[heart attack]] and he died of [[kidney failure]] quietly, in his sleep, shortly after 2 p.m. on 8 September 1949, in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> From his death-bed, typical for his enduring sense of humour, he commented to his daughter-in-law  Alice, \"dying is just as I composed it in Tod und Verkl\u00e4rung.\" <ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 113</ref>[[Georg Solti]], who had arranged Strauss's 85th birthday celebration, also directed an orchestra during Strauss's burial.<ref>''Portrait of Sir Georg Solti.'', documentary (1984), directed by Valerie Pitts</ref> The conductor later described how, during the singing of the famous trio from ''Rosenkavalier'', \"each singer broke down in tears and dropped out of the ensemble, but they recovered themselves and we all ended together.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 394</ref> Strauss's wife, Pauline de Ahna, died eight months later, on 13 May 1950, at the age of 88.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nStrauss's late works, modelled on \"the divine [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] at the end of a life full of thankfulness,\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 365</ref> are widely considered by music critics as the greatest works by any octogenarian composer.\nStrauss himself declared in 1947 with characteristic self-deprecation: \"I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer.\" The Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]] described Strauss in 1962 as \"the greatest musical figure who has lived in this century.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 3</ref>\n\n==Strauss as composer==\n[[File:Componist Richard Strauss-29152.ogv|{{largethumb}}|thumbtime=0:08|Strauss in Amsterdam (short film 1924)]]\n===Solo and chamber works and large ensembles===\nSome of Strauss's first compositions were solo instrumental and chamber works. These pieces include early compositions for piano solo in a conservative harmonic style, many of which are lost: two piano trios (1877 and 1878), a string quartet (1881), a [[Sonata for piano in B minor, Op. 5|piano sonata]] (1882), a [[Cello Sonata (Strauss)|cello sonata]] (1883), a piano quartet (1885), a [[Violin Sonata (Strauss)|violin sonata]] (1888), as well as a serenade (1882) and a longer suite (1884), both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns and contrabassoon.\n\nAfter 1890, Strauss composed very infrequently for chamber groups, his energies being almost completely absorbed with large-scale orchestral works and operas. Four of his chamber pieces are actually arrangements of portions of his operas, including the ''Daphne-Etude'' for solo violin and the String Sextet, which is the overture to his final opera ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]''. His last independent chamber work, an Allegretto in E major for violin and piano, dates from 1948.\n\nHe also composed two large-scale works for wind ensemble during this period: Sonatina No. 1 \"From an Invalid's Workshop\" (1943) and Sonatina No. 2 \"Happy Workshop\" (1946)\u2014both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns, a third clarinet in C, bassett horn, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon.\n\n===Tone poems and other orchestral works===\n{{Main|Tone poems (Strauss)}}\nStrauss wrote two early symphonies: [[Symphony No. 1 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 1]] (1880) and [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] (1884). However, Strauss's style began to truly develop and change when, in 1885, he met [[Alexander Ritter]], a noted composer and violinist, and the husband of one of Richard Wagner's nieces. It was Ritter who persuaded Strauss to abandon the conservative style of his youth and begin writing [[tone poem]]s. He also introduced Strauss to the essays of Wagner and the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Strauss went on to conduct one of Ritter's operas, and at Strauss's request Ritter later wrote a poem describing the events depicted in Strauss's tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra.ogg|title=Also Sprach Zarathustra|description=\"Sunrise fanfare\"}}\nThe new influences from Ritter resulted in what is widely regarded<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 69</ref> as Strauss's first piece to show his mature personality, the tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1888), which displays a new kind of virtuosity in its bravura orchestral manner. Strauss went on to write a series of increasingly ambitious tone poems: ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1889), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1903) and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1911\u20131915). One commentator has observed of these works that \"no orchestra could exist without his tone poems, written to celebrate the glories of the post-Wagnerian symphony orchestra.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nJames Hepokoski notes a shift in Strauss's technique in the tone poems, occurring between 1892 and 1893. It was after this point that Strauss rejected the philosophy of Schopenhauer and began more forcefully critiquing the institution of the symphony and the symphonic poem, thereby differentiating the second cycle of tone poems from the first.\n\n===Solo instrument with orchestra===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Neal O'Doan - Burleske.ogg|title=''Burleske''|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885\u201386), performed by Neal O'Doan with the [[Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra]]}}\nStrauss's output of works for solo instrument or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, which are still part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists\u2014[[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883) and [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1942); the [[Romanze for Cello and orchestra (Strauss)|Romanze for cello and orchestra]] (1883); a [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882); the [[Burleske|''Burleske'' for piano and orchestra]] (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem ''Don Quixote'' for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late Oboe Concerto in D major (1945); and the Duett-Concertino for clarinet and bassoon with string orchestra, which was one of his last works (1948).\n\n===Opera===\n{{See also|List of operas by Richard Strauss}}\nAround the end of the 19th century, Strauss turned his attention to opera. His first two attempts in the genre, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'' (1894) and ''[[Feuersnot]]'' (1901), were controversial works: ''Guntram'' was the first significant critical failure of Strauss's career, and ''Feuersnot'' was considered obscene by some critics.<ref>Tim Ashley, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/reviews/story/0,3604,404766,00.html Feuersnot]\". ''[[The Guardian]]''. London. 30 November 2000. Retrieved 27 October 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schmutzer-Richard Strauss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Richard Strauss engraved by Ferdinand Schmutzer (1922)]]\nIn 1905, Strauss produced ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the [[Salome (play)|play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]], which produced a passionate reaction from audiences. The premiere was a major success, with the artists taking more than 38 curtain calls.<ref>Derrick Puffett ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABrNsZOXIr4C ''Richard Strauss: \"Salome\"''] (1989), p. 4</ref> Many later performances of the opera were also successful, not only with the general public but also with Strauss's peers: [[Maurice Ravel]] said that ''Salome'' was \"stupendous\",<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 145</ref> and [[Gustav Mahler]] described it as \"a live volcano, a subterranean fire\".<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 149</ref> Strauss reputedly financed his house in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] completely from the revenues generated by the opera. As with the later ''Elektra'', ''Salome'' features an extremely taxing lead soprano role. Strauss often remarked that he preferred writing for the female voice, which is apparent in these two sister operas\u2014the male parts are almost entirely smaller roles, included only to supplement the soprano's performance.\n\nStrauss's next opera was ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), which took his use of dissonance even further, in particular with the [[Elektra chord]]. ''Elektra'' was also the first opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] as his librettist. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in his tone poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). For ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935), was composed with [[Stefan Zweig]] as librettist; ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1935\u201336) and ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1937) both had a libretto by [[Joseph Gregor]] and Stefan Zweig; and ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942), had a libretto by [[Clemens Krauss]], although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by [[Operabase]], in number of operas performed worldwide over the five seasons from 2008/09 to 2012/13, Strauss was the second-most performed 20th-century opera composer, ahead of [[Benjamin Britten]] and behind only [[Giacomo Puccini]].<ref name=operabase200820013>[http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en& The five seasons 2008/9 to 2012/13: Composers].

He often composed them with the voice of his wife in mind. His lieder were written for voice and piano, and he orchestrated several of them after the fact. In 1894\u20131895, around the age of 30, he published several well-known songs including \"[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]\", \"[[C\u00e4cilie (Strauss)|C\u00e4cilie]]\", \"[[Morgen!]]\", \"[[Heimliche Aufforderung]]\", and \"[[Traum durch die D\u00e4mmerung]]\". In 1918, after a long hiatus devoted to opera, he wrote [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 68 (Strauss)|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 68]], also called ''Brentano Lieder''. He completed his works in the genre in 1948 with ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' for soprano and orchestra. He reportedly composed these with [[Kirsten Flagstad]] in mind and she gave the first performance, which was recorded. Strauss's songs have always been popular with audiences and performers, and are generally considered by musicologists\u2014along with many of his other compositions\u2014to be masterpieces.\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Richard Strauss young portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Strauss]]\nUntil the 1980s, Strauss was regarded by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, backward-looking composer, but re-examination of and new research on the composer has re-evaluated his place as that of a modernist,<ref>Shirley, Hugo (2012). \"In Search of Strauss\" in ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', vol. 137, issue 1, pp. 187\u2013192</ref> albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration.<ref>Hepokoski, James, \"The Second Cycle of Tone Poems\" in Youmans (ed.), p. 78</ref> Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', the conductor [[Mark Elder]] \"was flabbergasted.

The style of his musical depictions of character (Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, the Hero) and emotions found their way into the lexicon of film music. Film music historian Timothy Schuerer wrote, \"The elements of post (late) romantic music that had greatest impact on scoring are its lush sound, expanded harmonic language, chromaticism, use of program music and use of [[Leitmotifs]]. Hollywood composers found the post-romantic idiom compatible with their efforts in scoring film\".<ref>Timothy Scheurer, ''Music and Mythmaking in Film'', Mcfarland, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0786431908}}. p. 41.</ref> [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Korngold]] came from the same musical world as Strauss and were quite naturally drawn to write in his style.

The film music of [[John Williams]] has continued the Strauss influence, in scores for mainstream hits such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/richard-strausss-influence-film-music/|title=WQXR \u2013 New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nStrauss has always been popular with audiences in the concert hall and continues to be so.

His 1929 performances of ''Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' and ''Don Juan'' with the [[Berlin State Opera Orchestra]] have long been considered the best of his early electrical recordings. In the first complete performance of his ''An Alpine Symphony'', made in 1941 and later released by [[EMI]], Strauss used the full complement of percussion instruments required in this work.\n\n[[Koch records|Koch Legacy]] has also released Strauss's recordings of overtures by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Peter Cornelius]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s was typical of the German nationalism that existed after [[World War I]]. Strauss clearly capitalized on national pride for the great German-speaking composers.\n\nThere were many other recordings, including some taken from radio broadcasts and concerts during the 1930s and early 1940s. The sheer volume of recorded performances would undoubtedly yield some definitive performances from a very capable and rather forward-looking conductor.\n\nIn 1944, Strauss celebrated his 80th birthday and conducted the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in recordings of his own major orchestral works, as well as his seldom-heard ''[[Schlagobers]]'' (''Whipped Cream'') ballet music. Some find more feeling in these performances than in Strauss's earlier recordings, which were recorded on the [[Magnetophon]] tape recording equipment. [[Vanguard Records]] later issued the recordings on LPs. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD by Preiser.  The last recording made by Strauss was on 19 October 1947 live at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where he conducted the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in his Burleske for piano and orchestra (Alfred Blumen piano), Don Juan and Sinfonia Domestica.<ref>Richard Strauss: The last concerts, CD issued by Testament SBT2 1441, 2009</ref>\n\nStrauss also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld system and in 1906 ten recordings for the [[reproducing piano]] [[Welte-Mignon]] all of which survive today. Strauss was also the composer of the music on the first CD to be commercially released: [[Deutsche Grammophon]]'s 1983 release of their 1980 recording of [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the ''Alpine Symphony''.\n\n===Modern critical reception of selected recordings conducted by Strauss===\n[[File:The orchestra and its instruments (1917) (14780185164).jpg|thumb|300px|Strauss conducting (circa 1900)]]\n[[Pierre Boulez]] has said that Strauss the conductor was \"a complete master of his trade\".{{sfn|Boulez|2003|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}} Music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] writes that, while Strauss was a very fine conductor, he often put scant effort into his recordings.<ref>Schonberg, p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Schonberg focused primarily on Strauss's recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 40]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], as well as noting that Strauss played a breakneck version of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] in about 45 minutes. Concerning Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Schonberg wrote, \"There is almost never a ''ritard'' or a change in expression or nuance. The slow movement is almost as fast as the following ''vivace''; and the last movement, with a big cut in it, is finished in 4 minutes, 25 seconds. (It should run between 7 and 8 minutes.)\" <ref>Schonberg (1967), p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> He also complained that the Mozart symphony had \"no force, no charm, no inflection, with a metronomic rigidity.\"\n\n[[Peter Gutmann (journalist)|Peter Gutmann]]'s 1994 review for ''ClassicalNotes.com'' says the performances of the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies, as well as Mozart's last three symphonies, are actually quite good, even if they are sometimes unconventional. Gutmann wrote:\n<blockquote>It is true, as the critics suggest, that the readings forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead is a solid sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It is also true that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.<ref>Peter Gutmann, [http://www.classicalnotes.net/reviews/strauss.html  \"Richard Strauss Conducts\"] on classicalnotes.net</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Richard Strauss (40).jpg|thumb|upright|Star on the Walk of Fame, Vienna]]\nHis honors included:<ref>Listed in Wilhelm, Kurt (1989), pp. 298\u201399.

Considered a leading composer of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and early [[20th-century classical music|modern]] eras, he has been described as a successor of [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Franz Liszt]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> Along with [[Gustav Mahler]], he represents the late flowering of [[German Romanticism]] after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of [[orchestration]] are combined with an advanced [[harmony|harmonic]] style.\n\nStrauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with [[tone poem]]s and [[opera]]s. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1890), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1905), and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) which used a libretto by [[Hedwig Lachmann]] that was a German translation of the French play ''[[Salome (play)|Salom\u00e9]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]: ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). His last operas, ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1938), ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938), ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942) used libretti written by [[Joseph Gregor]], the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, [[lied]]er (especially his ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' from 1948),  the [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882), the [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883), [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1943),  his [[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]] and other instrumental works such as ''[[Metamorphosen]]'' (1945).\n\nStrauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar]] from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducting Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with his wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the [[Berlin State Opera]] from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]], and in 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]]. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally.\n\nIn 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of [[Nazi Germany]]: head of the [[Reichsmusikkammer]] and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera ''Friedenstag'', which premiered just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.\n\n==Early life and career (1864\u20131886)==\n[[File:Richard Strauss 20OCT1886.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strauss aged 22]]\nStrauss was born on 11 June 1864 in [[Munich]], the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Pschorr) and [[Franz Strauss]], who was the principal [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] player at the Court Opera in Munich and a professor at the [[K\u00f6nigliche Musikschule]].<ref name=\"g1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Richard_Strauss.aspx|title=Richard Strauss facts, information, pictures|website=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> His mother was the daughter of Georg Pschorr, a financially prosperous [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|brewer from Munich]].<ref name=\"g1\">{{harvnb|Gilliam|Youmans|2001}}</ref>\n\nStrauss began his musical studies at the age of four, studying piano with August Tombo who was the harpist in the Munich Court Orchestra.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He soon after began attending the rehearsals of the orchestra, and began getting lessons in music theory and orchestration from the ensemble's assistant conductor. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction from [[Benno Walter]], the director of the Munich Court Orchestra and his father's cousin, and at 11 began five years of compositional study with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1882 he graduated from the Ludwigsgymnasium and afterwards attended only one year at the [[University of Munich]] in 1882\u20131883.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn addition to his formal teachers, Strauss was profoundly influenced musically by his father who made instrumental music-making central to the Strauss home. The Strauss family was frequently joined in their home for music making, meals, and other activities by the orphaned composer and music theorist [[Ludwig Thuille]] who was viewed as an adopted member of the family.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Strauss's father taught his son the music of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further assisted his son with his musical composition during the 1870s and into the early 1880s, providing advice, comments, and criticisms.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further provided support by showcasing his sons compositions in performance with the \u2018Wilde Gung'l\u2019, an amateur orchestra he conducted from 1875\u20131896. Many of his early symphonic compositions were written for this ensemble.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His compositions at this time were indebted to the style of [[Robert Schumann]] or [[Felix Mendelssohn]], true to his father's teachings. His father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn. His [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]], is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1874, Strauss heard his first [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1878 he attended performances of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' and ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' in Munich, and in 1879 he attended performances of the entire ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of ''Tristan und Isolde''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1882 he went to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to hear his father perform in the world premiere of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]''; after which surviving letters to his father and to Thuille detail his seemingly negative impression of Wagner and his music.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works.<ref name=\"B\">{{harvnb|Boyden|1999|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1882, in Vienna, Strauss gave the first performance of his [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]], playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] as assistant conductor to [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's ''Serenade (Op. 7)'' for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing B\u00fclow in rehearsal. B\u00fclow was very fond of the young man, and Strauss considered him as his greatest conducting mentor, often crediting him as teaching him \"the art of interpretation\".<ref name=\"g1\"/> Notably, under B\u00fclow's baton he made his first major appearance as a concert pianist, performing Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], for which he composed his own [[cadenza]]s.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1885, B\u00fclow unexpectedly resigned from his post, and Strauss was left to lead the Meiningen Court Orchestra as interim principal conductor for the remainder of the artistic season through April 1886.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He notably helped prepare the orchestra for the world premiere performance of [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]], which Brahms himself conducted. He also conducted his [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] for Brahms, who advised Strauss: \"Your symphony contains too much playing about with themes. This piling up of many themes based on a triad, which differ from one another only in rhythm, has no value.\"<ref name=\"g1\"/> Brahms' music, like Wagner's, also left a tremendous impression upon Strauss, and he often referred to this time of his life as his \u2018Brahmsschw\u00e4rmerei\u2019 (\u2018Brahms adoration\u2019) during which several his compositions clearly show Brahms' influence, including ''Wandrers Sturmlied'' (1884) and ''Burleske'' (1885\u201386).\"<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\n==Strauss finds success in conducting and tone poems (1885\u20131898)==\n[[File:Pauline Strauss de Ahna.jpg|thumb|Pauline de Ahna Strauss, c. 1900]]\nIn 1885 Strauss met the composer [[Alexander Ritter]] who was a violinist in the Meiningen orchestra and the husband of one of [[Richard Wagner]]'s nieces. An avid champion of the ideals of Wagner and [[Franz Liszt]], Ritter had a tremendous impact on the trajectory of Strauss' work as a composer from 1885 onward. Ritter convinced Strauss to abandon his more conservative style of composing and embrace the \"music of the future\" by modeling his compositional style off of Wagner and Liszt.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He further influenced Strauss by engaging him in studies and conversations on the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Wagner, and Friedrich von Hausegger. All of this together gave a new aesthetic anchor to Strauss which first became evident in his embrace of the [[tone poem]] genre.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter leaving his post in Meiningen in 1886, Strauss spent several weeks traveling throughout Italy before assuming a new post as third conductor at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] (then known as the Munich Hofoper). While traveling he wrote down descriptions of the various sites he was seeing along with tonal impressions that went with those descriptions. These he communicated in a letter to his mother, and they ultimately were used as the beginning of his first [[tone poem]], ''[[Aus Italien]]'' (1886).<ref name=\"g1\" /> Shortly after Strauss assumed his opera conducting duties in Munich, Ritter himself moved to the city in September 1886. For the next three years the two men would meet regularly, often joined by Thuille and [[Anton Seidl]], in order to discuss music, particularly Wagner and Liszt, and discuss poetry, literature, and philosophy.<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\nStrauss's tenure at the Bavarian State Opera was not a happy one. With the death of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] in June 1886, the opera house was not as well financially supported by his successor [[Otto of Bavaria]] which meant that much of the more ambitious and expensive repertoire that he wanted to stage, such as Wagner's operas, were unfeasible. The opera assignments he was given, works by Boieldieu, Auber and Donizetti, bored him, and to make matters worse Hermann Levi, the senior conductor at the house, was often ill and Strauss was required to step in at the last minute to conduct performance for operas which he had never rehearsed. This caused problems for him, the singers, and the orchestra. During this time, Strauss did find much more enjoyable conducting work outside Munich in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. In the latter city he met and befriended the composer [[Gustav Mahler]] in the autumn of 1887. Also happily, Strauss met his future wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], in 1887. De Ahna was then a voice student at the [[Munich Musikschule]], but soon switched to private lessons with Strauss who became her principal teacher.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn May 1889 Strauss left his post with the Bavarian State Opera after being appointed [[Kapellmeister]] to [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in Weimar, beginning in the Autumn of 1889. During the Summer of 1889 he served as the assistant conductor of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] during which time he befriended [[Cosima Wagner]] who became a longterm close friend.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Pauline De Anna went with Strauss to Weimar and he later married her on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of 1948, he preferred the [[soprano|soprano voice]] to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles. In Weimar she created the role of Freihild in Strauss's first opera, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'', in 1894. The opera was received with mixed reviews in Weimar, but its later production in Munich was met with scorn and was Strauss's first major failure.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n[[File:Strauss Haus Garmisch.JPG|thumb|Strauss villa at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. Built 1906. Architect: Emanuel Seidl.]]\nIn spite of the failure of his first opera, Strauss's tenure in Weimar brought about several important successes for his career. His tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' premiered in Weimar on 11 November 1889 to tremendous critical response, and the work quickly brought him international fame and success. This was followed by another lauded achievement, the premiere of his tone poem ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' in 1890. Both of these works, along with the earlier ''Burleske'', became internationally known and established him as a leading modernist composer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also had much success as a conductor in Weimar, particularly with the symphonic poems of Liszt and an uncut production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' in 1892.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn the Summer of 1894 Strauss made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user'' with Pauline singing Elisabeth. Just prior to their marriage the following September, Strauss left his post in Weimar when he was appointed Kapellmeister, or first conductor, of the Bavarian State Opera where he became responsible for the operas of Wagner. While working in Munich for the next four years he had his largest creative period period of tone poem composition, producing ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1894\u20131895.

By this time in his career, he was in constant demand as a guest conductor internationally and enjoyed celebrity status as a conductor; particularly in the works of Wagner, Mozart, and Liszt in addition to his own compositions.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He became president of the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein]] in 1901, and that same year became leader of the [[Berliner Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as editor of the book series ''Die Musik''. He used all of these posts to champion contemporary German composers like Mahler. His own compositions were becoming increasingly popular, and the first major orchestra to perform an entire concert of only his music was the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1901.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1903 Strauss Festivals dedicated to his music were established in London and Heidelberg. At the latter festival his cantata ''[[Taillefer (Strauss)|Taillefer]]'' was given its world premiere.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1904 Strauss embarked on his first North American tour, with stops in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Pittsburgh. At [[Carnegie Hall]] he conducted the world premiere of his ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' on March 21, 1904 with the [[Wetzler Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Wetzler\">{{cite news|title=Herman Wetzler, Composer, 72, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 30, 1943|page=26}}</ref> He also conducted several other works in collaboration with composer [[Hermann Hans Wetzler]] and his orchestra that year at Carnegie Hall, and also performed a concert of leider with his wife.<ref name=\"Wetzler\"/> During this trip he was working intensively on composing his third opera, ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', based on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1891 play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. The work, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, became Strauss's greatest triumph in his career up to that point, and opera houses all over the world quickly began programing the opera.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter ''Salome'', Strauss had a string of critically successful operas which he created with the librettist and poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. These operas included ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933).<ref name=\"g1\"/> While all of these works remain part of the opera repertoire, his opera ''Der Rosenkavalier'' is generally considered his finest achievement.<ref name=\"g1\"/> During this time he continued to work internationally as a celebrity conductor, and from 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]] with Reinhardt and the set designer Alfred Rolle. In 1924 Strauss's opera ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' premiered at the [[Semperoper|Dresden Semperoper]] with both the music and the libretto by Strauss. For this opera, Strauss wanted to move away from post-Wagnerian metaphysics which had been the philosophical framework of Hofmannsthal's libretti, and instead embrace a modern domestic comedy to Hofmannsthal's chagrin.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The work proved to be a success.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1924 Strauss's son Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsw\u00f6rth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Strauss in Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)==\n\n===''Reichsmusikkammer''===\nIn March 1933, when Strauss was 68, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rose to power]]. Strauss never joined the Nazi party, and studiously avoided [[Nazi salute|Nazi forms of greeting]]. For reasons of expediency, however, he was initially drawn into cooperating with the early Nazi regime in the hope that Hitler\u2014an ardent Wagnerian and music lover who had admired Strauss' work since viewing ''Salome'' in 1907\u2014would promote German art and culture. Strauss's need to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren also motivated his behavior,<ref name=\"g1\" /> in addition to his determination to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Claude Debussy]].\n\nIn 1933, Strauss wrote in his private notebook:\n<blockquote>I consider the [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]]-Goebbels Jew-baiting as a disgrace to German honour, as evidence of incompetence\u2014the basest weapon of untalented, lazy mediocrity against a higher intelligence and greater talent.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 274.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, far from being an admirer of Strauss's work, [[Joseph Goebbels]] maintained expedient cordiality with Strauss only for a period. Goebbels wrote in his diary:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately we still need him, but one day we shall have our own music and then we shall have no further need of this decadent neurotic.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 293</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Strauss Time 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss was on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' in 1927 and (here) 1938]]\nNevertheless, because of Strauss's international eminence, in November 1933 he was appointed to the post of president of the newly founded ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', the Reich Music Chamber. Strauss, who had lived through numerous political regimes and had no interest in politics, decided to accept the position but to remain apolitical, a decision which would eventually become untenable. He wrote to his family, \"I made music under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]], and under [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]]. I'll survive under this one as well.\"<ref name=em/> In 1935 he wrote in his journal:\n<blockquote>In November 1933, the minister Goebbels nominated me president of the ''Reichsmusikkammer'' without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, \"reorganized\" by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers.<ref name=em>Quoted on [http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/151/strauss-richard ''[[Exploring Music]]'' (2004) on the WFMT Radio Network; Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\"], first aired 9 January 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nStrauss privately scorned Goebbels and called him \"a pipsqueak\".<ref>Reuth 1993, p. 402</ref> However, in 1933 he dedicated an orchestral song, \"''Das B\u00e4chlein''\" (\"The Little Brook\"), to Goebbels, in order to gain his cooperation in extending German music copyright laws from 30 years to 50 years.<ref>Kennedy 1999, pp. 281\u2013282</ref> Also in 1933, he replaced [[Arturo Toscanini]] as director of the Bayreuth Festival after Toscanini had resigned in protest to the Nazi regime.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nStrauss attempted to ignore Nazi bans on performances of works by Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. He also continued to work on a comic opera, ''Die schweigsame Frau'', with his Jewish friend and librettist Stefan Zweig. When the opera was premiered in Dresden in 1935, Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appear on the theatrical billing, much to the ire of the Nazi regime. Hitler and Goebbels avoided attending the opera, and it was halted after three performances and subsequently banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 285</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1935, Strauss wrote a letter to Stefan Zweig, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>Do you believe I am ever, in any of my actions, guided by the thought that I am 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was consciously 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent and those who have none.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis letter to Zweig was intercepted by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to Hitler. Strauss was subsequently [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from his post as ''Reichsmusikkammer'' president in 1935. The [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]] nevertheless used Strauss's ''[[Olympische Hymne]]'', which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, \"To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I put it back on again\", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the ''Reichsmusikkammer''.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (1978), Review of \"A Confidential Matter: The Letters of Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig, 1931\u20131935\" in ''[[Music & Letters]]'', Vol.&nbsp;59, No.&nbsp;4, October 1978. pp.&nbsp;472\u2013475.</ref> Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 316</ref>\n\n===Operas with Joseph Gregor and work to save his Jewish daughter-in-law ===\n[[File:Strauss 1938.jpg|thumb|240px|Strauss at Garmisch in 1938]]\nFrustrated that he could no longer work with Zweig as his librettist, Strauss turned to [[Joseph Gregor]], a Viennese theatre historian, at Gregor's request. The first opera they worked on together was ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', but it ultimately became the second of their operas to be premiered. Their first work to be staged was in 1938, when the entire nation was preparing for war, they presented ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (''Peace Day''), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The work is essentially a hymn to peace and a thinly veiled criticism of the Third Reich. With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]''. Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men collaborated on two more operas which proved to be Strauss's last: ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nWhen his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice was placed under house arrest in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in 1938, Strauss used his connections in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant [[Heinz Tietjen]], to secure her safety. He drove to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in order to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, for the release of Alice's grandmother, Paula Neumann. In the end, Neumann and 25 other relatives were murdered in the camps.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/06/arts/music-richard-strauss-and-hitler-s-reich-jupiter-in-hell.html \"Music; Richard Strauss and Hitler's Reich: Jupiter in Hell\"] by [[Michael Hans Kater]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 January 2002</ref> While Alice's mother, Marie von Grab, was safe in Lucerne, Switzerland, Strauss also wrote several letters to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 339</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Strauss moved with his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her children could be protected by [[Baldur von Schirach]], the [[Gauleiter]] of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and his son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, and he was able to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n===''Metamorphosen'' and apprehension by USA troops===\nStrauss completed the composition of ''[[Metamorphosen]]'', a work for 23 solo strings, in 1945. The title and inspiration for the work comes from a profoundly self-examining poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], which Strauss had considered setting as a choral work.<ref name=Ross338>Ross (2009), p. 338</ref> Generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of the string repertoire, ''Metamorphosen'' contains Strauss's most sustained outpouring of tragic emotion. Conceived and written during the blackest days of [[World War II]], the piece expresses Strauss's mourning of, among other things, the destruction of German culture\u2014including the bombing of every great opera house in the nation. At the end of the war, Strauss wrote in his private diary:\n<blockquote>The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2000 years of cultural evolution met its doom.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 361</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1945, Strauss was apprehended by American soldiers at his Garmisch estate. As he descended the staircase he announced to Lieutenant Milton Weiss of the U.S. Army, \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer of ''Rosenkavalier'' and ''Salome''.\" Lt. Weiss, who was also a musician, nodded in recognition. An \"Off Limits\" sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss.<ref>Ross 2009, p. 373</ref> The American oboist [[John de Lancie (oboist)|John de Lancie]], who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto.

The events of World War II seemed to bring the composer\u2014who had grown old, tired, and a little jaded\u2014into focus.<ref>[[Bill McGlaughlin|McGlaughlin, Bill]].

Now elderly and with very few resources remaining, Strauss and his wife left Germany for Switzerland in October 1945 where they settled in a hotel just outside Z\u00fcrich. There they met the Swiss music critic [[Willi Schuh (musicologist)|Willy Schuh]], who became Strauss's biographer. Strapped for cash, in 1947 Strauss embarked on his last international tour, a three-week trip to London, in which he conducted several of his tone poems and excerpts of his operas, and was present during a complete staging of ''Elektra'' by the [[BBC]]. The trip was a critical success and provided him and his wife with some much needed money.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nFrom May\u2013September 1948, just before his death, Strauss composed the ''Four Last Songs'' which deal with the subject of dying. The last one, \"Im Abendrot\" (At Sunset), ends with the line \"Is this perhaps death?\" The question is not answered in words, but instead Strauss quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his earlier tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''\u2014meant to symbolize the transfiguration and fulfilment of the soul after death. In June 1948, he was cleared of any wrong-doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.<ref name=\"g1\"/> That same month he orchestrated ''[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]'', a song that he had originally composed in 1894.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1948 Strauss was hospitalized for several weeks after undergoing bladder surgery.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His health rapidly deteriorated after that, and he conducted his last performance, the end of Act 2 of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the [[Prinzregententheater]] in Munich, during celebrations of his 85th birthday on June 10, 1949. On August 15 he suffered from a [[heart attack]] and he died of [[kidney failure]] quietly, in his sleep, shortly after 2 p.m. on 8 September 1949, in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> From his death-bed, typical for his enduring sense of humour, he commented to his daughter-in-law  Alice, \"dying is just as I composed it in Tod und Verkl\u00e4rung.\" <ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 113</ref>[[Georg Solti]], who had arranged Strauss's 85th birthday celebration, also directed an orchestra during Strauss's burial.<ref>''Portrait of Sir Georg Solti.'', documentary (1984), directed by Valerie Pitts</ref> The conductor later described how, during the singing of the famous trio from ''Rosenkavalier'', \"each singer broke down in tears and dropped out of the ensemble, but they recovered themselves and we all ended together.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 394</ref> Strauss's wife, Pauline de Ahna, died eight months later, on 13 May 1950, at the age of 88.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nStrauss's late works, modelled on \"the divine [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] at the end of a life full of thankfulness,\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 365</ref> are widely considered by music critics as the greatest works by any octogenarian composer.\nStrauss himself declared in 1947 with characteristic self-deprecation: \"I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer.\" The Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]] described Strauss in 1962 as \"the greatest musical figure who has lived in this century.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 3</ref>\n\n==Strauss as composer==\n[[File:Componist Richard Strauss-29152.ogv|{{largethumb}}|thumbtime=0:08|Strauss in Amsterdam (short film 1924)]]\n===Solo and chamber works and large ensembles===\nSome of Strauss's first compositions were solo instrumental and chamber works. These pieces include early compositions for piano solo in a conservative harmonic style, many of which are lost: two piano trios (1877 and 1878), a string quartet (1881), a [[Sonata for piano in B minor, Op. 5|piano sonata]] (1882), a [[Cello Sonata (Strauss)|cello sonata]] (1883), a piano quartet (1885), a [[Violin Sonata (Strauss)|violin sonata]] (1888), as well as a serenade (1882) and a longer suite (1884), both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns and contrabassoon.\n\nAfter 1890, Strauss composed very infrequently for chamber groups, his energies being almost completely absorbed with large-scale orchestral works and operas. Four of his chamber pieces are actually arrangements of portions of his operas, including the ''Daphne-Etude'' for solo violin and the String Sextet, which is the overture to his final opera ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]''. His last independent chamber work, an Allegretto in E major for violin and piano, dates from 1948.\n\nHe also composed two large-scale works for wind ensemble during this period: Sonatina No. 1 \"From an Invalid's Workshop\" (1943) and Sonatina No. 2 \"Happy Workshop\" (1946)\u2014both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns, a third clarinet in C, bassett horn, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon.\n\n===Tone poems and other orchestral works===\n{{Main|Tone poems (Strauss)}}\nStrauss wrote two early symphonies: [[Symphony No. 1 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 1]] (1880) and [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] (1884). However, Strauss's style began to truly develop and change when, in 1885, he met [[Alexander Ritter]], a noted composer and violinist, and the husband of one of Richard Wagner's nieces. It was Ritter who persuaded Strauss to abandon the conservative style of his youth and begin writing [[tone poem]]s. He also introduced Strauss to the essays of Wagner and the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Strauss went on to conduct one of Ritter's operas, and at Strauss's request Ritter later wrote a poem describing the events depicted in Strauss's tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra.ogg|title=Also Sprach Zarathustra|description=\"Sunrise fanfare\"}}\nThe new influences from Ritter resulted in what is widely regarded<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 69</ref> as Strauss's first piece to show his mature personality, the tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1888), which displays a new kind of virtuosity in its bravura orchestral manner. Strauss went on to write a series of increasingly ambitious tone poems: ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1889), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1903) and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1911\u20131915). One commentator has observed of these works that \"no orchestra could exist without his tone poems, written to celebrate the glories of the post-Wagnerian symphony orchestra.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nJames Hepokoski notes a shift in Strauss's technique in the tone poems, occurring between 1892 and 1893. It was after this point that Strauss rejected the philosophy of Schopenhauer and began more forcefully critiquing the institution of the symphony and the symphonic poem, thereby differentiating the second cycle of tone poems from the first.\n\n===Solo instrument with orchestra===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Neal O'Doan - Burleske.ogg|title=''Burleske''|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885\u201386), performed by Neal O'Doan with the [[Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra]]}}\nStrauss's output of works for solo instrument or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, which are still part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists\u2014[[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883) and [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1942); the [[Romanze for Cello and orchestra (Strauss)|Romanze for cello and orchestra]] (1883); a [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882); the [[Burleske|''Burleske'' for piano and orchestra]] (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem ''Don Quixote'' for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late Oboe Concerto in D major (1945); and the Duett-Concertino for clarinet and bassoon with string orchestra, which was one of his last works (1948).\n\n===Opera===\n{{See also|List of operas by Richard Strauss}}\nAround the end of the 19th century, Strauss turned his attention to opera. His first two attempts in the genre, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'' (1894) and ''[[Feuersnot]]'' (1901), were controversial works: ''Guntram'' was the first significant critical failure of Strauss's career, and ''Feuersnot'' was considered obscene by some critics.<ref>Tim Ashley, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/reviews/story/0,3604,404766,00.html Feuersnot]\". ''[[The Guardian]]''. London. 30 November 2000. Retrieved 27 October 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schmutzer-Richard Strauss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Richard Strauss engraved by Ferdinand Schmutzer (1922)]]\nIn 1905, Strauss produced ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the [[Salome (play)|play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]], which produced a passionate reaction from audiences. The premiere was a major success, with the artists taking more than 38 curtain calls.<ref>Derrick Puffett ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABrNsZOXIr4C ''Richard Strauss: \"Salome\"''] (1989), p. 4</ref> Many later performances of the opera were also successful, not only with the general public but also with Strauss's peers: [[Maurice Ravel]] said that ''Salome'' was \"stupendous\",<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 145</ref> and [[Gustav Mahler]] described it as \"a live volcano, a subterranean fire\".<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 149</ref> Strauss reputedly financed his house in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] completely from the revenues generated by the opera. As with the later ''Elektra'', ''Salome'' features an extremely taxing lead soprano role. Strauss often remarked that he preferred writing for the female voice, which is apparent in these two sister operas\u2014the male parts are almost entirely smaller roles, included only to supplement the soprano's performance.\n\nStrauss's next opera was ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), which took his use of dissonance even further, in particular with the [[Elektra chord]]. ''Elektra'' was also the first opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] as his librettist. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in his tone poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). For ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935), was composed with [[Stefan Zweig]] as librettist; ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1935\u201336) and ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1937) both had a libretto by [[Joseph Gregor]] and Stefan Zweig; and ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942), had a libretto by [[Clemens Krauss]], although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by [[Operabase]], in number of operas performed worldwide over the five seasons from 2008/09 to 2012/13, Strauss was the second-most performed 20th-century opera composer, ahead of [[Benjamin Britten]] and behind only [[Giacomo Puccini]].<ref name=operabase200820013>[http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en& The five seasons 2008/9 to 2012/13: Composers].

He often composed them with the voice of his wife in mind. His lieder were written for voice and piano, and he orchestrated several of them after the fact. In 1894\u20131895, around the age of 30, he published several well-known songs including \"[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]\", \"[[C\u00e4cilie (Strauss)|C\u00e4cilie]]\", \"[[Morgen!]]\", \"[[Heimliche Aufforderung]]\", and \"[[Traum durch die D\u00e4mmerung]]\". In 1918, after a long hiatus devoted to opera, he wrote [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 68 (Strauss)|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 68]], also called ''Brentano Lieder''. He completed his works in the genre in 1948 with ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' for soprano and orchestra. He reportedly composed these with [[Kirsten Flagstad]] in mind and she gave the first performance, which was recorded. Strauss's songs have always been popular with audiences and performers, and are generally considered by musicologists\u2014along with many of his other compositions\u2014to be masterpieces.\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Richard Strauss young portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Strauss]]\nUntil the 1980s, Strauss was regarded by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, backward-looking composer, but re-examination of and new research on the composer has re-evaluated his place as that of a modernist,<ref>Shirley, Hugo (2012). \"In Search of Strauss\" in ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', vol. 137, issue 1, pp. 187\u2013192</ref> albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration.<ref>Hepokoski, James, \"The Second Cycle of Tone Poems\" in Youmans (ed.), p. 78</ref> Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', the conductor [[Mark Elder]] \"was flabbergasted.

[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] heard ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' in 1902, and later said that the work \"contained the seeds for a new life\"; a Straussian influence is clearly present in his works of that period, including his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First String Quartet]], ''[[Kossuth (Bart\u00f3k)|Kossuth]]'', and ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]''.<ref>Elliott Antokoletz and Paolo Susanni, ''B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k: A Research and Information Guide'', 2nd Revised edition (1997), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|978-0815320883}}, Introduction p. xxi.</ref> [[Karol Szymanowski]] was also greatly influenced by Strauss, reflected in such pieces as his ''Concert Overture'' and his first and [[Symphony No. 2 (Szymanowski)|second]] symphonies,<ref>Paul Caldrin, \"Orchestra music and orchestration\", pp. 166\u2013169 in  Paul Cadrin and Stephen Downes (editors), ''The Szymanowski Companion'', Routledge, London, Revised edition (2015). {{ISBN|978-0754661511}}</ref> and his opera ''[[Hagith (opera)|Hagith]]'' which was modeled after ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''.  English composers were also influenced by Strauss, from [[Edward Elgar]] in his concert overture ''[[In the South (Alassio)]]'' and other works<ref>Ian Parrott, ''Elgar (Master Musician)'', Everyman Ltd, London, First Edition (1971), p. 60.</ref> to [[Benjamin Britten]] in his opera writing.

The style of his musical depictions of character (Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, the Hero) and emotions found their way into the lexicon of film music. Film music historian Timothy Schuerer wrote, \"The elements of post (late) romantic music that had greatest impact on scoring are its lush sound, expanded harmonic language, chromaticism, use of program music and use of [[Leitmotifs]]. Hollywood composers found the post-romantic idiom compatible with their efforts in scoring film\".<ref>Timothy Scheurer, ''Music and Mythmaking in Film'', Mcfarland, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0786431908}}. p. 41.</ref> [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Korngold]] came from the same musical world as Strauss and were quite naturally drawn to write in his style. As film historian Roy Prendergast wrote, \"When confronted with the kind of dramatic problem films presented to them, Steiner, Korngold and [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Newman]] ... looked to Wagner, [[Puccini]], Verdi and Strauss for the answers to dramatic film scoring.\"<ref>Roy Prendergast, ''Film Music: A neglected Art'', W.W Norton & Company, 1992, {{ISBN|978 0393308747}}.</ref> Later, the opening to ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' became one of the best-known pieces of film music when [[Stanley Kubrick]] used it in his 1968 movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. The film music of [[John Williams]] has continued the Strauss influence, in scores for mainstream hits such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/richard-strausss-influence-film-music/|title=WQXR \u2013 New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nStrauss has always been popular with audiences in the concert hall and continues to be so.

The ranking is Debussy, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Strauss, Prokofiev.</ref>\n\n==Strauss as a conductor==\n[[File:DBPB 1954 124 Richard Strauss.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Stamp issued in 1954]]\nStrauss, as conductor, made a large number of recordings, both of his own music as well as music by German and Austrian composers. His 1929 performances of ''Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' and ''Don Juan'' with the [[Berlin State Opera Orchestra]] have long been considered the best of his early electrical recordings. In the first complete performance of his ''An Alpine Symphony'', made in 1941 and later released by [[EMI]], Strauss used the full complement of percussion instruments required in this work.\n\n[[Koch records|Koch Legacy]] has also released Strauss's recordings of overtures by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Peter Cornelius]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s was typical of the German nationalism that existed after [[World War I]]. Strauss clearly capitalized on national pride for the great German-speaking composers.\n\nThere were many other recordings, including some taken from radio broadcasts and concerts during the 1930s and early 1940s. The sheer volume of recorded performances would undoubtedly yield some definitive performances from a very capable and rather forward-looking conductor.\n\nIn 1944, Strauss celebrated his 80th birthday and conducted the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in recordings of his own major orchestral works, as well as his seldom-heard ''[[Schlagobers]]'' (''Whipped Cream'') ballet music. Some find more feeling in these performances than in Strauss's earlier recordings, which were recorded on the [[Magnetophon]] tape recording equipment. [[Vanguard Records]] later issued the recordings on LPs. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD by Preiser.  The last recording made by Strauss was on 19 October 1947 live at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where he conducted the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in his Burleske for piano and orchestra (Alfred Blumen piano), Don Juan and Sinfonia Domestica.<ref>Richard Strauss: The last concerts, CD issued by Testament SBT2 1441, 2009</ref>\n\nStrauss also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld system and in 1906 ten recordings for the [[reproducing piano]] [[Welte-Mignon]] all of which survive today. Strauss was also the composer of the music on the first CD to be commercially released: [[Deutsche Grammophon]]'s 1983 release of their 1980 recording of [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the ''Alpine Symphony''.\n\n===Modern critical reception of selected recordings conducted by Strauss===\n[[File:The orchestra and its instruments (1917) (14780185164).jpg|thumb|300px|Strauss conducting (circa 1900)]]\n[[Pierre Boulez]] has said that Strauss the conductor was \"a complete master of his trade\".{{sfn|Boulez|2003|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}} Music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] writes that, while Strauss was a very fine conductor, he often put scant effort into his recordings.<ref>Schonberg, p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Schonberg focused primarily on Strauss's recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 40]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], as well as noting that Strauss played a breakneck version of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] in about 45 minutes. Concerning Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Schonberg wrote, \"There is almost never a ''ritard'' or a change in expression or nuance. The slow movement is almost as fast as the following ''vivace''; and the last movement, with a big cut in it, is finished in 4 minutes, 25 seconds. (It should run between 7 and 8 minutes.)\" <ref>Schonberg (1967), p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> He also complained that the Mozart symphony had \"no force, no charm, no inflection, with a metronomic rigidity.\"\n\n[[Peter Gutmann (journalist)|Peter Gutmann]]'s 1994 review for ''ClassicalNotes.com'' says the performances of the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies, as well as Mozart's last three symphonies, are actually quite good, even if they are sometimes unconventional. Gutmann wrote:\n<blockquote>It is true, as the critics suggest, that the readings forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead is a solid sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It is also true that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.<ref>Peter Gutmann, [http://www.classicalnotes.net/reviews/strauss.html  \"Richard Strauss Conducts\"] on classicalnotes.net</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Richard Strauss (40).jpg|thumb|upright|Star on the Walk of Fame, Vienna]]\nHis honors included:<ref>Listed in Wilhelm, Kurt (1989), pp. 298\u201399.

The final official release was in early 2015.\n\nUnder Plan 9, UNIX's ''[[everything is a file]]'' metaphor is extended via a pervasive network-centric [[file system|filesystem]], and the [[addressable cursor|cursor-addressed]], [[computer terminal|terminal]]-based [[input/output|I/O]] at the heart of [[Unix-like|UNIX-like]] operating systems is replaced by a [[windowing system]] and [[graphical user interface]] without cursor addressing, although [[rc]], the Plan 9 [[shell (computing)|shell]], is text-based.\n\nThe name ''Plan 9 from Bell Labs'' is a reference to the [[Ed Wood]] 1959 cult [[science fiction]] [[Z-movie]] ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''.<ref name=\"taoup\"/>  The name of the project's mascot is \u201cGlenda, the Plan 9 Bunny.\u201d  The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.<ref name=\"9front-announcement\"/><ref name=\"9atom-home\"/>\n\n== History ==\nPlan 9 from Bell Labs was originally developed, starting in the late 1980s,<ref name=\"9atom-home\" /> by members of the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Labs, the same group that originally developed [[Unix]] and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].<ref name=\"creators\" /> The Plan 9 team was initially led by [[Rob Pike]], [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]], Dave Presotto and Phil Winterbottom, with support from [[Dennis Ritchie]] as head of the Computing Techniques Research Department.  Over the years, many notable developers have contributed to the project, including [[Brian Kernighan]], [[Tom Duff]], [[Doug McIlroy]], [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] and [[Bruce Ellis]].<ref name=\"developers\" />\n\nPlan 9 replaced Unix as Bell Labs's primary platform for operating systems research. It explored several changes to the original Unix model that facilitate the use and programming of the system, notably in distributed [[multi-user]] environments. After several years of development and internal use, Bell Labs shipped the operating system to universities in 1992. Three years later, Plan 9 was made available for commercial parties by AT&T via the book publisher [[Harcourt Brace]].

Like the Quakers, Plan 9 does not proselytize.\n |source = \u2014Sape J. Mullender, Pierre G. Jansen.<br/>''Real Time in a Real Operating System''<ref name = \"HerbertJones2004\" />\n |align = right\n |width = 33%\n |salign = right}}\nPlan 9 is a [[distributed operating system]], designed to make a network of [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] and geographically separated computers function as a single system.<ref name = \"reinventing-unix\" /> In a typical Plan 9 installation, users work at terminals running the window system [[rio (windowing system)|rio]], and they access CPU servers which handle computation-intensive processes. Permanent data storage is provided by additional network hosts acting as file servers and archival storage.<ref name= \"distributed-system\" />\n\nIts designers state that,\n\n{{quote|[t]he foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process [[namespace|name space]] and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.|Pike ''et al.''{{r|use-of-namespaces}}}}\n\nThe first idea means that, unlike on most operating systems, [[Process (computing)|processes]] (running programs) each have their own view of the ''namespace'', corresponding to what other operating systems call the file system; a single path name may refer to different resources for different processes. The potential complexity of this setup is controlled by a set of conventional locations for common resources.{{r|welch}}{{r|man4namespace}}\n\nThe second idea means that processes can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files that appear in the other processes' namespace. The [[Client\u2013server model|client]] process's input/output on such a file becomes [[inter-process communication]] between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the [[Unix filesystem|filesystem]] as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of [[device file]]s to provide access to peripheral devices ([[computer mouse|mice]], removable media, etc.) and the possibility to [[mount (Unix)|mount]] filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.\n\nFor example, the original window system, called 8\u00bd, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal by means of three pseudo-files: {{mono|mouse}}, which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, {{mono|cons}}, which can be used to perform textual input/output, and {{mono|bitblt}}, writing to which enacts graphics operations (see [[bit blit]]). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which {{mono|mouse}}, {{mono|cons}} and {{mono|bitblt}} are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input.{{r|distributed-system}} The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.\n\nPlan 9's distributed operation relies on the per-process namespaces as well, allowing client and server processes to communicate across machines in the way just outlined. For example, the {{mono|cpu}} command starts a remote session on a computation server. The command exports part of its local namespace, including the user's terminal's devices ({{mono|mouse}}, {{mono|cons}}, {{mono|bitblt}}), to the server, so that remote programs can perform input/output using the terminal's mouse, keyboard and display, combining the effects of remote login and a shared network filesystem.{{r|distributed-system}}{{r|use-of-namespaces}}\n\n=== 9P protocol ===\n{{Main |9P (protocol)}}\n\nAll programs that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified protocol, called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces the number of custom [[application programming interface|programming interfaces]]. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, [[byte-oriented]] protocol that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> The protocol is used to refer to and communicate with processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network.<ref name=\"not_dead\" /> With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.<ref name=\"osnews-4th-edition-release\" />\n\nUnlike most other operating systems, Plan 9 does not provide special [[application programming interface]]s (such as [[Berkeley sockets]], [[X resources]] or [[ioctl]] system calls) to access devices.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system, so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file [[input/output]] operations ''read'' and ''write''. Consequently, sharing the device across the network can be accomplished by mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.<ref name=\"taoup\" />\n\n=== Union directories and namespaces ===\nPlan 9 allows the user to collect the files (called ''names'') from different directory trees in a single location. The resulting ''[[Union (set theory)|union]] directory'' behaves as the concatenation of the underlying directories (the order of concatenation can be controlled); if the constituent directories contain files having the same name, a listing of the union directory ({{mono|ls}} or {{mono|lc}}) will simply report duplicate names.{{r|valerie-aurora}} Resolution of a single path name is performed top-down: if the directories {{mono|top}} and {{mono|bottom}} are unioned into {{mono|u}} with {{mono|top}} first, then {{mono|u/name}} denotes {{mono|top/name}} if it exists, {{mono|bottom/name}} only if it exists ''and {{mono|top/name}} does not exist'', and no file if neither exists. No recursive unioning of subdirectories is performed, so if {{mono|top/subdir}} exists, the files in {{mono|bottom/subdir}} are not accessible through the union.{{r|4.4bsd}}\n\nA union directory can be created by using the {{mono|bind}} command:\n\n<pre>\n; bind /arm/bin /bin\n; bind -a /acme/bin/arm /bin\n; bind -b /usr/alice/bin /bin\n</pre>\n\nIn the example above, {{mono|/arm/bin}} is mounted at {{mono|/bin}}, the contents of {{mono|/arm/bin}} replacing the previous contents of {{mono|/bin}}. [[Acme (text editor)|Acme]]'s {{mono|bin}} directory is then union mounted after {{mono|/bin}}, and Alice's personal {{mono|bin}} directory is union mounted before. When a file is requested from {{mono|/bin}}, it is first looked for in {{mono|/usr/alice/bin}}, then in {{mono|/arm/bin}}, and then finally in {{mono|/acme/bin/arm}}.\n\nThe separate process namespaces thus replace the notion of a [[PATH (variable)|search path]] in the shell. Where Unix shells have a list of directories to search for programs when given a command, the Plan 9 shell only looks in the directory {{mono|/bin}}; adding commands is done by binding several directories together to appear as a single {{mono|/bin}}.<ref name= \"distributed-system\" />\n\nFurthermore, the kernel can keep separate mount tables for each process,<ref name=\"HerbertJones2004\"/> and can thus provide each process with its own file system [[namespace]]. Processes' namespaces can be constructed independently, and the user may work simultaneously with programs that have heterogeneous namespaces.<ref name = \"use-of-namespaces\" /> Namespaces may be used to create an isolated environment similar to [[chroot]], but in a more secure way.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" />\n\nPlan 9's union directory architecture inspired [[4.4BSD]] and [[Linux]] [[union mount|union file system]] implementations,{{r|valerie-aurora}} although the developers of the BSD union mounting facility found the non-recursive merging of directories in Plan 9 \"too restrictive for general purpose use\".{{r|4.4bsd}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Special virtual filesystems ===\n\n==== /proc ====\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (process management).png|thumb|right|Listing processes with [[ls|list contents of directory (ls, lc) command]]<ref name=\"unix-plan9-command-translation\" /> in {{mono|/proc}}]]\n{{Main |procfs}}\nInstead of having system calls specifically for [[process management (computing)|process management]], Plan 9 provides the {{mono|/proc}} file system. Each [[Process (computing)|process]] appears as a directory containing information and control files which can be manipulated by the ordinary file IO system calls.<ref name = \"intro-abstractions\" />\n\nThe file system approach allows Plan 9 processes to be managed with simple file management tools such as [[ls]] and [[cat (Unix)|cat]]; however, the processes cannot be copied and moved as files.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n==== /net ====\nPlan 9 does not have specialised system calls or [[ioctl]]s for accessing the networking stack or networking hardware. Instead, the {{mono|/net}} file system is used. Network connections are controlled by reading and writing control messages to control files.  Sub-directories such as {{mono|/net/tcp}} and {{mono|/net/udp}} are used as an interface to their respective protocols.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\n{{further|UTF-8|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\nTo reduce the complexity of managing [[character encoding]]s, Plan 9 uses [[Unicode]] throughout the system. The initial Unicode implementation was [[ISO 10646]]. [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]] invented UTF-8, which became the [[native (computing)|native]] encoding in Plan 9. The entire system was converted to general use in 1992.<ref name= \"utf8\" /> UTF-8 preserves backwards compatibility with traditional [[null-terminated string]]s, enabling more reliable information processing and the chaining of multilingual string data with [[Unix pipe]]s between multiple processes.  Using a single UTF-8 encoding with characters for all cultures and regions eliminates the need for switching between code sets.<ref name=\"Lunde1999\" />\n\n=== Combining the design concepts ===\nThough interesting on their own, the design concepts of Plan 9 were supposed to be most useful when combined together. For example, to implement a [[network address translation]] (NAT) server, a union directory can be created, overlaying the [[router (computing)|router]]'s {{mono|/net}} directory tree with its own {{mono|/net}}. Similarly, a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) can be implemented by overlaying in a union directory a {{mono|/net}} hierarchy from a remote [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]], using secured 9P over the public Internet. A union directory with the {{mono|/net}} hierarchy and filters can be used to [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] an untrusted application or to implement a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> In the same manner, a distributed computing network can be composed with a union directory of {{mono|/proc}} hierarchies from remote hosts, which allows interacting with them as if they are local.\n\nWhen used together, these features allow for assembling a complex distributed computing environment by reusing the existing hierarchical name system.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n== Software for Plan 9 ==\n{{further|List of Plan 9 applications}}\nAs a benefit from the system's design, most tasks in Plan 9 can be accomplished by using [[ls]], [[Cat (Unix)|cat]], [[grep]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]] and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] utilities in combination with the [[rc shell]] (the default Plan 9 shell).\n\n[[Factotum (software)|Factotum]] is an [[authentication server|authentication]] and [[key management]] server for Plan 9. It handles authentication on behalf of other programs such that both [[secret key]]s and implementation details need only be known to Factotum.<ref name=\"auth-paper\" />\n\n=== Graphical programs ===\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|right|Plan 9 running [[acme (text editor)|acme]] and rc]]\nUnlike [[Unix]], Plan 9 was designed with graphics in mind.<ref name=\"not_dead\" /> After booting, a Plan 9 terminal will run the [[rio (windowing system)|rio]] windowing system, in which the user can create new windows displaying [[rc]].<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /> Graphical programs invoked from this shell replace it in its window.\n\nThe [[plumber (Plan 9)|plumber]] provides an [[inter-process communication]] mechanism which allows system-wide hyperlinking.\n\n[[sam (text editor)|Sam]] and [[acme (text editor)|acme]] are Plan 9's text editors.<ref name=\"usethis-interview-russ-cox\" />\n\n=== Storage system ===\nPlan 9 supports the Kfs, Paq, Cwfs, [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], and [[Fossil (file system)|Fossil]] file systems. The last was designed at Bell Labs specifically for Plan 9 and provides snapshot storage capability. It can be used directly with a hard drive or backed with [[Venti]], an archival file system and permanent data storage system.\n\n=== Software development ===\nThe distribution package for Plan 9 includes special compiler variants and programming languages, and provides a tailored set of libraries along with a windowing [[user interface]] system specific to Plan 9.<ref name=\"Dixon2004\" /> The bulk of the system is written in a dialect of C ([[ANSI C]] with some extensions and some other features left out). The compilers for this language were custom built with portability in mind; according to their author, they \"compile quickly, load slowly, and produce medium quality object code\".<ref name=\"auug-new-c-compiler\" />\n\nA [[concurrent programming language]] called [[Alef (programming language)|Alef]] was available in the first two editions, but was then dropped for maintenance reasons and replaced by a [[Thread (computing)|threading]] library for C.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pike|first=Rob|title=Rio: Design of a Concurrent Window System|url=http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/3rd_edition/rio/rio_slides.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{man|2|thread|Plan 9}}</ref>\n\n=== Unix compatibility ===\nThough Plan 9 was supposed to be a further development of Unix concepts, compatibility with preexisting Unix software was never the goal for the project. Many [[command-line]] utilities of Plan 9 share the names of Unix counterparts, but work differently.<ref name=\"unix-plan9-command-translation\" />\n\nPlan 9 can support [[POSIX]] applications and can emulate the [[Berkeley socket interface]] through the [[ANSI/POSIX Environment]] (APE) that implements an [[runtime environment|interface]] close to [[ANSI C]] and [[POSIX]], with some common extensions (the native Plan 9 C interfaces conform to neither standard). It also includes a POSIX-compatible shell. APE's authors claim to have used it to port the [[X Window System]] (X11) to Plan 9, although they do not ship X11 \"because supporting it properly is too big a job\".<ref name=\"docs-ape\" /> Some Linux binaries can be used with the help of a \"linuxemu\" (Linux emulator) application; however, it is still a work in progress.<ref name=\"linuxemu\" /> Vice versa, the [[vx32]] virtual machine allows a slightly modified Plan 9 kernel to run as a user process in Linux, supporting unmodified Plan 9 programs.{{r|vx32}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Comparison to contemporary operating systems ===\nIn 1991, Plan 9's designers compared their system to other early nineties operating systems in terms of size, showing that the source code for a minimal (\"working, albeit not very useful\") version was less than one-fifth the size of a [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] [[microkernel]] without any device drivers (5899 or 4622 [[lines of code]] for Plan 9, depending on metric, vs. 25530 lines). The complete kernel comprised 18000 lines of code.{{r|distributed-system}} (According to a 2006 count, the kernel was then some 150,000 lines, but this was compared against more than 4.8&nbsp;million in [[Linux]].{{r|unix-spirit-set-free}})\n\nWithin the operating systems research community, as well as the commercial Unix world, other attempts at achieving distributed computing and remote filesystem access were made concurrently with the Plan 9 design effort. These included the [[Network File System]] and the associated [[vnode]] architecture developed at [[Sun Microsystems]], and more radical departures from the Unix model such as the [[Sprite (operating system)|Sprite]] OS from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. Sprite developer Brent Welch points out that the SunOS vnode architecture is limited compared to Plan 9's capabilities in that it does not support remote device access and remote inter-process communication cleanly, even though it could have, had the preexisting [[UNIX domain sockets]] (which \"can essentially be used to name user-level servers\") been integrated with the vnode architecture.{{r|welch}}\n\nOne critique of the \"everything is a file\", communication-by-textual-message design of Plan 9 pointed out limitations of this paradigm compared to the [[static typing|typed]] interfaces of Sun's [[object-oriented operating system]], [[Spring (operating system)|Spring]]:\n\n{{quote|Plan 9 constrains everything to look like a file. In most cases the real interface type comprises the protocol of messages that must be written to, and read from, a file descriptor. This is difficult to specify and document, and prohibits any automatic [[type checking]] at all, except for file errors at run time. (...)\n\n[A] path name relative to a process' implicit root context is the ''only'' way to name a service. Binding a name to an object can only be done by giving an existing name for the object, in the same context as the new name. As such, interface references simply ''cannot'' be passed between processes, much less across networks. Instead, communication has to rely on conventions, which are prone to error and do not scale.|Roscoe; emphasis in the original.{{r|roscoe}}}}\n\nA later retrospective comparison of Plan 9, Sprite and a third contemporary distributed research operating system, [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]], found that\n\n{{quote|the environments they [Amoeba and Sprite] build are tightly coupled within the OS, making communication with external services difficult. Such systems suffer from the radical departure from the UNIX model, which also discourages portability of already existing software to the platform (...). The lack of developers, the very small range of supported hardware and the small, even compared to Plan 9, user base have also significantly slowed the adoption of those systems (...). In retrospect, Plan 9 was the only research distributed OS from that time which managed to attract developers and be used in commercial projects long enough to warrant its survival to this day.|Mirtchovski, Simmonds and Minnich{{r|integrated}}}}\n\n=== Impact ===\n[[File:Wmii-3.6 screenshot.png|thumb|right|The [[wmii]] [[X window manager]] was inspired by [[acme (text editor)|acme]], a text editor from the Plan 9 project.<ref name=\"wmii\" />]]\nPlan 9 demonstrated that an integral concept of Unix\u2014that every system interface could be represented as a set of files\u2014could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system.<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /> Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of [[rfork]], Plan 9's process creation mechanism.{{r|opensources}} Additionally, in [[Plan 9 from User Space]], several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity.

Raymond]]<ref name=\"taoup\" />}}\n\nOther factors that contributed to low adoption of Plan 9 include the lack of commercial backup, the low number of end-user applications, and the lack of [[device driver]]s.<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /><ref name=\"usethis-interview-russ-cox\" />\n\nPlan 9 proponents and developers claim that the problems hindering its adoption have been solved, that its original goals as a distributed system, development environment, and research platform have been met, and that it enjoys moderate but growing popularity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], through its hosted capabilities, has been a vehicle for bringing Plan 9 technologies to other systems as a hosted part of heterogeneous computing grids.<ref name=\"vitanuova-grid\" /><ref name=\"rutgers\" /><ref name=\"york\" />\n\nSeveral projects work to extend Plan 9, including 9atom and 9front.

The final official release was in early 2015.\n\nUnder Plan 9, UNIX's ''[[everything is a file]]'' metaphor is extended via a pervasive network-centric [[file system|filesystem]], and the [[addressable cursor|cursor-addressed]], [[computer terminal|terminal]]-based [[input/output|I/O]] at the heart of [[Unix-like|UNIX-like]] operating systems is replaced by a [[windowing system]] and [[graphical user interface]] without cursor addressing, although [[rc]], the Plan 9 [[shell (computing)|shell]], is text-based.\n\nThe name ''Plan 9 from Bell Labs'' is a reference to the [[Ed Wood]] 1959 cult [[science fiction]] [[Z-movie]] ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''.<ref name=\"taoup\" />  The name of the project's mascot is \"Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny\". The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.<ref name=\"9front-announcement\" /><ref name=\"9atom-home\" />\n\n== History ==\nPlan 9 from Bell Labs was originally developed, starting in the late 1980s,<ref name=\"9atom-home\" /> by members of the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Labs, the same group that originally developed [[Unix]] and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].<ref name=\"creators\" /> The Plan 9 team was initially led by [[Rob Pike]], [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]], Dave Presotto and Phil Winterbottom, with support from [[Dennis Ritchie]] as head of the Computing Techniques Research Department.  Over the years, many notable developers have contributed to the project, including [[Brian Kernighan]], [[Tom Duff]], [[Doug McIlroy]], [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] and [[Bruce Ellis]].<ref name=\"developers\" />\n\nPlan 9 replaced Unix as Bell Labs's primary platform for operating systems research. It explored several changes to the original Unix model that facilitate the use and programming of the system, notably in distributed [[multi-user]] environments. After several years of development and internal use, Bell Labs shipped the operating system to universities in 1992. Three years later, Plan 9 was made available for commercial parties by AT&T via the book publisher [[Harcourt Brace]]. With source licenses costing $350, AT&T targeted the embedded systems market rather than the computer market at large. Ritchie commented that the developers did not expect to do \"much displacement\" given how established other operating systems had become.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[InfoWorld]] |first=Yvonne L. |last=Lee |title=AT&T Bell Labs ships Plan 9 OS for embedded systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3joEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16 |date=24 July 1995}}</ref>\n\nBy early 1996, the Plan 9 project had been \"put on the back burner\" by AT&T in favor of [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], intended to be a rival to [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Java (software platform)|Java platform]].<ref>{{cite news |title=AT&T reveals plans for Java competitor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3 |newspaper=InfoWorld |first=Jason |last=Pontin |date=19 February 1996 |page=3}}</ref>\nIn the late 1990s, Bell Labs' new owner [[Lucent Technologies]] dropped commercial support for the project and in 2000, a third release was distributed under an [[open-source license]]. A fourth release under a new [[free software]] license occurred in 2002.<ref name=\"osnews-4th-edition-release\" />\n\nA user and development community, including current and former [[Bell Labs]] personnel, produced minor daily releases in the form of [[ISO image]]s.

Like the Quakers, Plan 9 does not proselytize.\n |source = \u2014Sape J. Mullender, Pierre G. Jansen.<br/>''Real Time in a Real Operating System''<ref name = \"HerbertJones2004\" />\n |align = right\n |width = 33%\n |salign = right}}\nPlan 9 is a [[distributed operating system]], designed to make a network of [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] and geographically separated computers function as a single system.<ref name = \"reinventing-unix\" /> In a typical Plan 9 installation, users work at terminals running the window system [[rio (windowing system)|rio]], and they access CPU servers which handle computation-intensive processes. Permanent data storage is provided by additional network hosts acting as file servers and archival storage.<ref name= \"distributed-system\" />\n\nIts designers state that,\n\n{{quote|[t]he foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process [[namespace|name space]] and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.|Pike ''et al.''{{r|use-of-namespaces}}}}\n\nThe first idea means that, unlike on most operating systems, [[Process (computing)|processes]] (running programs) each have their own view of the ''namespace'', corresponding to what other operating systems call the file system; a single path name may refer to different resources for different processes. The potential complexity of this setup is controlled by a set of conventional locations for common resources.{{r|welch}}{{r|man4namespace}}\n\nThe second idea means that processes can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files that appear in the other processes' namespace. The [[Client\u2013server model|client]] process's input/output on such a file becomes [[inter-process communication]] between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the [[Unix filesystem|filesystem]] as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of [[device file]]s to provide access to peripheral devices ([[computer mouse|mice]], removable media, etc.) and the possibility to [[mount (Unix)|mount]] filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.\n\nFor example, the original window system, called 8\u00bd, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal by means of three pseudo-files: {{mono|mouse}}, which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, {{mono|cons}}, which can be used to perform textual input/output, and {{mono|bitblt}}, writing to which enacts graphics operations (see [[bit blit]]). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which {{mono|mouse}}, {{mono|cons}} and {{mono|bitblt}} are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input.{{r|distributed-system}} The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.\n\nPlan 9's distributed operation relies on the per-process namespaces as well, allowing client and server processes to communicate across machines in the way just outlined. For example, the {{mono|cpu}} command starts a remote session on a computation server. The command exports part of its local namespace, including the user's terminal's devices ({{mono|mouse}}, {{mono|cons}}, {{mono|bitblt}}), to the server, so that remote programs can perform input/output using the terminal's mouse, keyboard and display, combining the effects of remote login and a shared network filesystem.{{r|distributed-system}}{{r|use-of-namespaces}}\n\n=== 9P protocol ===\n{{Main |9P (protocol)}}\n\nAll programs that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified protocol, called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces the number of custom [[application programming interface|programming interfaces]]. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, [[byte-oriented]] protocol that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> The protocol is used to refer to and communicate with processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network.<ref name=\"not_dead\" /> With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.<ref name=\"osnews-4th-edition-release\" />\n\nUnlike most other operating systems, Plan 9 does not provide special [[application programming interface]]s (such as [[Berkeley sockets]], [[X resources]] or [[ioctl]] system calls) to access devices.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system, so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file [[input/output]] operations ''read'' and ''write''. Consequently, sharing the device across the network can be accomplished by mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.<ref name=\"taoup\" />\n\n=== Union directories and namespaces ===\nPlan 9 allows the user to collect the files (called ''names'') from different directory trees in a single location. The resulting ''[[Union (set theory)|union]] directory'' behaves as the concatenation of the underlying directories (the order of concatenation can be controlled); if the constituent directories contain files having the same name, a listing of the union directory ({{mono|ls}} or {{mono|lc}}) will simply report duplicate names.{{r|valerie-aurora}} Resolution of a single path name is performed top-down: if the directories {{mono|top}} and {{mono|bottom}} are unioned into {{mono|u}} with {{mono|top}} first, then {{mono|u/name}} denotes {{mono|top/name}} if it exists, {{mono|bottom/name}} only if it exists ''and {{mono|top/name}} does not exist'', and no file if neither exists. No recursive unioning of subdirectories is performed, so if {{mono|top/subdir}} exists, the files in {{mono|bottom/subdir}} are not accessible through the union.{{r|4.4bsd}}\n\nA union directory can be created by using the {{mono|bind}} command:\n\n<pre>\n; bind /arm/bin /bin\n; bind -a /acme/bin/arm /bin\n; bind -b /usr/alice/bin /bin\n</pre>\n\nIn the example above, {{mono|/arm/bin}} is mounted at {{mono|/bin}}, the contents of {{mono|/arm/bin}} replacing the previous contents of {{mono|/bin}}. [[Acme (text editor)|Acme]]'s {{mono|bin}} directory is then union mounted after {{mono|/bin}}, and Alice's personal {{mono|bin}} directory is union mounted before. When a file is requested from {{mono|/bin}}, it is first looked for in {{mono|/usr/alice/bin}}, then in {{mono|/arm/bin}}, and then finally in {{mono|/acme/bin/arm}}.\n\nThe separate process namespaces thus replace the notion of a [[PATH (variable)|search path]] in the shell. Where Unix shells have a list of directories to search for programs when given a command, the Plan 9 shell only looks in the directory {{mono|/bin}}; adding commands is done by binding several directories together to appear as a single {{mono|/bin}}.<ref name= \"distributed-system\" />\n\nFurthermore, the kernel can keep separate mount tables for each process,<ref name=\"HerbertJones2004\"/> and can thus provide each process with its own file system [[namespace]]. Processes' namespaces can be constructed independently, and the user may work simultaneously with programs that have heterogeneous namespaces.<ref name = \"use-of-namespaces\" /> Namespaces may be used to create an isolated environment similar to [[chroot]], but in a more secure way.<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" />\n\nPlan 9's union directory architecture inspired [[4.4BSD]] and [[Linux]] [[union mount|union file system]] implementations,{{r|valerie-aurora}} although the developers of the BSD union mounting facility found the non-recursive merging of directories in Plan 9 \"too restrictive for general purpose use\".{{r|4.4bsd}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Special virtual filesystems ===\n\n==== /proc ====\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (process management).png|thumb|right|Listing processes with [[ls|list contents of directory (ls, lc) command]]<ref name=\"unix-plan9-command-translation\" /> in {{mono|/proc}}]]\n{{Main |procfs}}\nInstead of having system calls specifically for [[process management (computing)|process management]], Plan 9 provides the {{mono|/proc}} file system. Each [[Process (computing)|process]] appears as a directory containing information and control files which can be manipulated by the ordinary file IO system calls.<ref name = \"intro-abstractions\" />\n\nThe file system approach allows Plan 9 processes to be managed with simple file management tools such as [[ls]] and [[cat (Unix)|cat]]; however, the processes cannot be copied and moved as files.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n==== /net ====\nPlan 9 does not have specialised system calls or [[ioctl]]s for accessing the networking stack or networking hardware. Instead, the {{mono|/net}} file system is used. Network connections are controlled by reading and writing control messages to control files.  Sub-directories such as {{mono|/net/tcp}} and {{mono|/net/udp}} are used as an interface to their respective protocols.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\n{{further|UTF-8|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\nTo reduce the complexity of managing [[character encoding]]s, Plan 9 uses [[Unicode]] throughout the system. The initial Unicode implementation was [[ISO 10646]]. [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]] invented UTF-8, which became the [[native (computing)|native]] encoding in Plan 9. The entire system was converted to general use in 1992.<ref name= \"utf8\" /> UTF-8 preserves backwards compatibility with traditional [[null-terminated string]]s, enabling more reliable information processing and the chaining of multilingual string data with [[Unix pipe]]s between multiple processes.  Using a single UTF-8 encoding with characters for all cultures and regions eliminates the need for switching between code sets.<ref name=\"Lunde1999\" />\n\n=== Combining the design concepts ===\nThough interesting on their own, the design concepts of Plan 9 were supposed to be most useful when combined together. For example, to implement a [[network address translation]] (NAT) server, a union directory can be created, overlaying the [[router (computing)|router]]'s {{mono|/net}} directory tree with its own {{mono|/net}}. Similarly, a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) can be implemented by overlaying in a union directory a {{mono|/net}} hierarchy from a remote [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]], using secured 9P over the public Internet. A union directory with the {{mono|/net}} hierarchy and filters can be used to [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] an untrusted application or to implement a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref name=\"unix-spirit-set-free\" /> In the same manner, a distributed computing network can be composed with a union directory of {{mono|/proc}} hierarchies from remote hosts, which allows interacting with them as if they are local.\n\nWhen used together, these features allow for assembling a complex distributed computing environment by reusing the existing hierarchical name system.<ref name=\"design-paper\" />\n\n== Software for Plan 9 ==\n{{further|List of Plan 9 applications}}\nAs a benefit from the system's design, most tasks in Plan 9 can be accomplished by using [[ls]], [[Cat (Unix)|cat]], [[grep]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]] and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] utilities in combination with the [[rc shell]] (the default Plan 9 shell).\n\n[[Factotum (software)|Factotum]] is an [[authentication server|authentication]] and [[key management]] server for Plan 9. It handles authentication on behalf of other programs such that both [[secret key]]s and implementation details need only be known to Factotum.<ref name=\"auth-paper\" />\n\n=== Graphical programs ===\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|right|Plan 9 running [[acme (text editor)|acme]] and rc]]\nUnlike [[Unix]], Plan 9 was designed with graphics in mind.<ref name=\"not_dead\" /> After booting, a Plan 9 terminal will run the [[rio (windowing system)|rio]] windowing system, in which the user can create new windows displaying [[rc]].<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /> Graphical programs invoked from this shell replace it in its window.\n\nThe [[plumber (Plan 9)|plumber]] provides an [[inter-process communication]] mechanism which allows system-wide hyperlinking.\n\n[[sam (text editor)|Sam]] and [[acme (text editor)|acme]] are Plan 9's text editors.<ref name=\"usethis-interview-russ-cox\" />\n\n=== Storage system ===\nPlan 9 supports the Kfs, Paq, Cwfs, [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], and [[Fossil (file system)|Fossil]] file systems. The last was designed at Bell Labs specifically for Plan 9 and provides snapshot storage capability. It can be used directly with a hard drive or backed with [[Venti]], an archival file system and permanent data storage system.\n\n=== Software development ===\nThe distribution package for Plan 9 includes special compiler variants and programming languages, and provides a tailored set of libraries along with a windowing [[user interface]] system specific to Plan 9.<ref name=\"Dixon2004\" /> The bulk of the system is written in a dialect of C ([[ANSI C]] with some extensions and some other features left out). The compilers for this language were custom built with portability in mind; according to their author, they \"compile quickly, load slowly, and produce medium quality object code\".<ref name=\"auug-new-c-compiler\" />\n\nA [[concurrent programming language]] called [[Alef (programming language)|Alef]] was available in the first two editions, but was then dropped for maintenance reasons and replaced by a [[Thread (computing)|threading]] library for C.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pike|first=Rob|title=Rio: Design of a Concurrent Window System|url=http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/3rd_edition/rio/rio_slides.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{man|2|thread|Plan 9}}</ref>\n\n=== Unix compatibility ===\nThough Plan 9 was supposed to be a further development of Unix concepts, compatibility with preexisting Unix software was never the goal for the project. Many [[command-line]] utilities of Plan 9 share the names of Unix counterparts, but work differently.<ref name=\"unix-plan9-command-translation\" />\n\nPlan 9 can support [[POSIX]] applications and can emulate the [[Berkeley socket interface]] through the [[ANSI/POSIX Environment]] (APE) that implements an [[runtime environment|interface]] close to [[ANSI C]] and [[POSIX]], with some common extensions (the native Plan 9 C interfaces conform to neither standard). It also includes a POSIX-compatible shell. APE's authors claim to have used it to port the [[X Window System]] (X11) to Plan 9, although they do not ship X11 \"because supporting it properly is too big a job\".<ref name=\"docs-ape\" /> Some Linux binaries can be used with the help of a \"linuxemu\" (Linux emulator) application; however, it is still a work in progress.<ref name=\"linuxemu\" /> Vice versa, the [[vx32]] virtual machine allows a slightly modified Plan 9 kernel to run as a user process in Linux, supporting unmodified Plan 9 programs.{{r|vx32}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Comparison to contemporary operating systems ===\nIn 1991, Plan 9's designers compared their system to other early nineties operating systems in terms of size, showing that the source code for a minimal (\"working, albeit not very useful\") version was less than one-fifth the size of a [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] [[microkernel]] without any device drivers (5899 or 4622 [[lines of code]] for Plan 9, depending on metric, vs. 25530 lines). The complete kernel comprised 18000 lines of code.{{r|distributed-system}} (According to a 2006 count, the kernel was then some 150,000 lines, but this was compared against more than 4.8&nbsp;million in [[Linux]].{{r|unix-spirit-set-free}})\n\nWithin the operating systems research community, as well as the commercial Unix world, other attempts at achieving distributed computing and remote filesystem access were made concurrently with the Plan 9 design effort. These included the [[Network File System]] and the associated [[vnode]] architecture developed at [[Sun Microsystems]], and more radical departures from the Unix model such as the [[Sprite (operating system)|Sprite]] OS from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. Sprite developer Brent Welch points out that the SunOS vnode architecture is limited compared to Plan 9's capabilities in that it does not support remote device access and remote inter-process communication cleanly, even though it could have, had the preexisting [[UNIX domain sockets]] (which \"can essentially be used to name user-level servers\") been integrated with the vnode architecture.{{r|welch}}\n\nOne critique of the \"everything is a file\", communication-by-textual-message design of Plan 9 pointed out limitations of this paradigm compared to the [[static typing|typed]] interfaces of Sun's [[object-oriented operating system]], [[Spring (operating system)|Spring]]:\n\n{{quote|Plan 9 constrains everything to look like a file. In most cases the real interface type comprises the protocol of messages that must be written to, and read from, a file descriptor. This is difficult to specify and document, and prohibits any automatic [[type checking]] at all, except for file errors at run time. (...)\n\n[A] path name relative to a process' implicit root context is the ''only'' way to name a service. Binding a name to an object can only be done by giving an existing name for the object, in the same context as the new name. As such, interface references simply ''cannot'' be passed between processes, much less across networks. Instead, communication has to rely on conventions, which are prone to error and do not scale.|Roscoe; emphasis in the original.{{r|roscoe}}}}\n\nA later retrospective comparison of Plan 9, Sprite and a third contemporary distributed research operating system, [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]], found that\n\n{{quote|the environments they [Amoeba and Sprite] build are tightly coupled within the OS, making communication with external services difficult. Such systems suffer from the radical departure from the UNIX model, which also discourages portability of already existing software to the platform (...). The lack of developers, the very small range of supported hardware and the small, even compared to Plan 9, user base have also significantly slowed the adoption of those systems (...). In retrospect, Plan 9 was the only research distributed OS from that time which managed to attract developers and be used in commercial projects long enough to warrant its survival to this day.|Mirtchovski, Simmonds and Minnich{{r|integrated}}}}\n\n=== Impact ===\n[[File:Wmii-3.6 screenshot.png|thumb|right|The [[wmii]] [[X window manager]] was inspired by [[acme (text editor)|acme]], a text editor from the Plan 9 project.<ref name=\"wmii\" />]]\nPlan 9 demonstrated that an integral concept of Unix\u2014that every system interface could be represented as a set of files\u2014could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system.<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /> Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of [[rfork]], Plan 9's process creation mechanism.{{r|opensources}} Additionally, in [[Plan 9 from User Space]], several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the [[GNU]] operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs.<ref name=\"glendix\" /><ref name=\"gentoo\" /> The [[9wm]] [[X window manager|window manager]] was inspired by [[8\u00bd (Plan 9)|8\u00bd]], the older windowing system of Plan 9;<ref name=\"9wm\" /> [[wmii]] is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.<ref name=\"wmii\" />\nIn computer science research, Plan 9 has been used as a [[grid computing]] platform{{r|9grid}}{{r|integrated}} and as a vehicle for research into [[ubiquitous computing]] without [[middleware]].{{r|ubiquitous}}\nIn commerce, Plan 9 underlies [[Coraid]] storage systems.\nHowever, Plan 9 has never approached Unix in popularity, and has been primarily a research tool:\n{{quote|[I]t looks like Plan 9 failed simply because it fell short of being a compelling enough improvement on Unix to displace its ancestor. Compared to Plan 9, Unix creaks and clanks and has obvious rust spots, but it gets the job done well enough to hold its position. There is a lesson here for ambitious system architects: the most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough.|[[Eric S. Raymond]]<ref name=\"taoup\" />}}\n\nOther factors that contributed to low adoption of Plan 9 include the lack of commercial backup, the low number of end-user applications, and the lack of [[device driver]]s.<ref name=\"osnews-investigating\" /><ref name=\"usethis-interview-russ-cox\" />\n\nPlan 9 proponents and developers claim that the problems hindering its adoption have been solved, that its original goals as a distributed system, development environment, and research platform have been met, and that it enjoys moderate but growing popularity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], through its hosted capabilities, has been a vehicle for bringing Plan 9 technologies to other systems as a hosted part of heterogeneous computing grids.<ref name=\"vitanuova-grid\" /><ref name=\"rutgers\" /><ref name=\"york\" />\n\nSeveral projects work to extend Plan 9, including 9atom and 9front. These [[fork (software)|fork]]s augment Plan 9 with additional [[hardware driver]]s and software, including an improved version of the Upas [[e-mail]] system, the [[go (programming language)|go]] compiler, [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]] [[version control system]] support, and other programs.<ref name=\"9atom-home\" /><ref name=\"9front\" /> Plan 9 was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Raspberry Pi]] single-board computer.<ref name=\"rasppi\"/><ref name=\"raspinst\"/> The Harvey project attempts to replace the custom Plan 9 C compiler with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], to leverage modern development tools such as [[GitHub]] and [[Coverity]], and speed up development.{{r|harvey}}\n\n==== Derivatives and forks ====\n[[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]] is a descendant of Plan 9, and shares many design concepts and even source code in the kernel, particularly around devices and the Styx/9P2000 protocol.\nInferno shares with Plan 9 the Unix heritage from Bell Labs and the [[Unix philosophy]].

The plant is not very palatable, but will be eaten by animals with no other forage; poisonings typically occur from ingestion of green plant material or material in hay. The toxic components can cause liver failure, referred to as \"walking disease\" or \"sleepy staggers\". Signs include weight loss, weakness, sleepiness, yawning, incoordination, yellowish discoloration to mucous membranes (icterus), neurologic problems secondary to liver failure (aimless walking, chewing motions, [[head pressing]]). Animals may appear to be normal at first, then become suddenly affected; the syndrome progresses rapidly over a few days to a week.\n\n== Medicine ==\nThe purple coloration of the flower lent itself to the so-called \"heliotrope cyanosis\" that was characteristic of severely ill patients in the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Honigsbaum|first=Mark|date=2018-06|title=Spanish influenza redux: revisiting the mother of all pandemics|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31360-6|journal=The Lancet|volume=391|issue=10139|pages=2492\u20132495|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(18)31360-6|issn=0140-6736}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens1.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Leaves 2580px.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Cluster 3000px.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Flower 2500px.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q159153}}\n\n[[Category:Heliotropium|arborescens]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1759]]\n\n\n{{Asterid-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n|name = Garden heliotrope\n|image = Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Flower 2500px.jpg\n|genus = Heliotropium\n|species = arborescens\n|authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|L.]]\n|synonyms =\n    {{Plainlist | style = margin-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em; |\n*''Heliotropium corymbosum'' <small>Ruiz & Pav.</small>\n*''Heliotropium peruvianum'' <small>L.</small>\n    }}\n|synonyms_ref = <ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2843787\n|title=The Plant List: A Working List of All Plant Species\n|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Heliotropium arborescens''''', the '''garden heliotrope''', is a [[species]] of [[flowering plant]] in the borage [[family (botany)|family]] Boraginaceae, native to [[Peru]].

The plant is not very palatable, but will be eaten by animals with no other forage; poisonings typically occur from ingestion of green plant material or material in hay. The toxic components can cause liver failure, referred to as \"walking disease\" or \"sleepy staggers\". Signs include weight loss, weakness, sleepiness, yawning, incoordination, yellowish discoloration to mucous membranes (icterus), neurologic problems secondary to liver failure (aimless walking, chewing motions, [[head pressing]]). Animals may appear to be normal at first, then become suddenly affected; the syndrome progresses rapidly over a few days to a week.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens1.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Leaves 2580px.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Cluster 3000px.jpg\nImage:Heliotropium arborescens 'Mini Marine' Heliotrope Flower 2500px.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q159153}}\n\n[[Category:Heliotropium|arborescens]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1759]]\n\n\n{{Asterid-stub}}\n", "name_user": "GK20", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added reference to 1918 flu pandemic - \"heliotrope cyanosis\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliotropium_arborescens"}
