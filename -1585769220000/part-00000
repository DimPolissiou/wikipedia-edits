It stars Covino, Marvin, [[Gayle Rankin]], [[Talia Balsam]], [[George Wendt]], and [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]].\n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019. It is scheduled to be released on July 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Classics]].\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Mike and Kyle are biking together when Mike breaks the news to Kyle that he's currently sleeping with his fianc\u00e9. In the ensuing argument, Mike has a moment of road rage with a motorist that culminates into Mike getting assaulted after chasing the motorist down the road. At the hospital, where Mike is recovering from minor head wounds, Kyle's fianc\u00e9 visits Mike and is confronted by Kyle over her affair. After she tells him that she still loves him, he then asks if she still wants to get married.\n\nKyle's fianc\u00e9 goes on to marry Mike instead, but she unexpectedly dies shortly after. A visibly distraught Mike causes a scene at her funeral which is diffused by Kyle, who came to pay his respects. Mike admits to Kyle that what he did was wrong and that he's a terrible friend. Though Kyle is still angry at Mike, he still consoles him over his loss. Sometime later, Kyle, now in better physical shape, is working as a commercial-jingle writer and is dating his former high-school girlfriend, Marissa, with whom he is celebrating Thanksgiving with his family. Though his overprotective, overbearing mother is disapproving of the relationship, she is nonetheless happy for him when he announces his engagement with her. She then reveals to Kyle that she invited Mike to celebrate Christmas with them, noting his having no family of his own to celebrate with.\n\nOn Christmas night, a now overweight, alcoholic Mike arrives at Kyle's family's home. Finding his way into the garage, he comes across some old pictures of himself and his old helmet from when he played football in high school. Kyle's mother confronts Mike and tells him that he needs to make amends with Kyle for his selfish actions stop feeling sorry for himself over how he hurt him. Kyle then stumbles into the living room where he passes out drunk.\n\nSeeing Mike's worsened state, Kyle invites him to join him and Marissa on their vacation to a ski resort over New Years. After breaking his arm on a difficult slope, Mike is given permission by Kyle to stay with them for the night, the two of them getting drunk together and catching up on their pasts. A frustrated Marissa tells Kyle that Mike is a negative influence on his life and that he needs to cut him out from it. When Marissa goes to bed early, Kyle joins her in the hopes of having sex, but he quickly passes out before she returns from the bathroom. She then goes down to confront Mike about his behavior, and he attempts to kiss her. Though disgusted, she physically pressures him into following through with his advances, convinced that it will finally convince Kyle to break off their friendship for good.\n\nMike and Marissa's brother Ronnie plan a surprise ice-fishing bachelor party for Kyle before his impending wedding with Marissa. When Kyle momentarily steps away from the party, Mike approaches him and admits that he slept with Marissa. Kyle, angered once again, surprises Mike by saying that he no longer cares and simply wants to spend his life with someone who cares for him. Mike responds that Marissa doesn't actually care for Kyle as he is and wants to turn him into something she wants him to be, suggesting that he leaves her. At some point, Kyle breaks through a thin patch of ice in the frozen lake, though Mike manages to pull him out.\n\nKyle has since cut all ties with Mike, who is lonelier than ever. On the day of Kyle and Marissa's wedding, Mike crashes the ceremony and objects to their union, instigating a small brawl in the church between him and members of both Kyle and Marissa's families. During the confrontation, Marissa loudly declares that she's pregnant and that she's adamant about getting married. Upon learning this, the priest refuses to wed them over concerns that their child is pressuring them into a potentially doomed marriage and advises them to wait until after the child is born.\n\nAbout a year later, Mike is now working at a bicycle shop/caf\u00e9, where a now-married Kyle and Marissa visit him with their newly-born son, the former of whom still misses Mike.\n\nSeveral years later, Kyle and Marissa decide to divorce, presumably over Kyle's seeming refusal to remove Mike from his life. Kyle lives close to Marissa to stay in touch with their son and maintains his friendship with Mike, whom Kyle's son affectionately refers to as his \u201cuncle.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* Michael Angelo Covino as Mike\n* Kyle Marvin as Kyle\n* [[Gayle Rankin]] as Marissa\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Ava\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Suzi\n* [[George Wendt]] as Jim\n* Daniella Covino as Dani\n\n==Release==\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=May 9, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/cannes-festival-2019-full-list-of-films |title=Cannes festival 2019: full list of films |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 18, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-climb-movie-cycling-comedy-sony-classics-deal-cannes-1202622085/|title=Sony Classics Acquires Un Certain Regard Buddy Comedy \u2018The Climb\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> The film went onto screen at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/telluride-film-festival-2019-lineup-ford-vs-ferrari-judy-full-list-of-movies-1202706577/|title=Telluride Film Festival: \u2018Ford V Ferrari\u2019, \u2018Judy\u2019, \u2018Motherless Brooklyn\u2019, Weinstein-Inspired Drama \u2018The Assistant\u2019 Among Premieres Headed to 46th Edition \u2013 Full List|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Pete|last=Hammond|date=August 29, 2019|accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aeronauts-burnt-orange-heresy-join-tiff-2019-lineup-1231031|title='The Aeronauts,' 'Burnt Orange Heresy' Added to Toronto Film Fest Lineup|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|date=August 13, 2019|accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/events/the-climb|title=The Climb|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundance.org/projects/the-climb-3d1157ca-7585-4795-884c-945641173bac|title=The Climb|website=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt was scheduled to be released on March 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/video/the-climb-trailer-cannes-feature-1202198306/|title=\u2018The Climb\u2019 Trailer: Cannes Breakout Kicks the Buddy Comedy Into a Hilarious New Gear \u2014 Exclusive|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Previously, Sony Pictures Classics stated they would go ahead with the release of the film despite the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/the-climb-interview-coronavirus-michael-covino-1202217527/|title=As Studios Postpone Big Theatrical Releases, \u2018The Climb\u2019 Sees Opportunity \u2014 For Now|website=IndieWire|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=March 13, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> However, it was later pulled from the schedule, and re-dated to July 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/sony-pictures-classics-release-the-climb-postponed-in-wake-of-ny-la-theater-closures-1202884481/|title=Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 Release \u2018The Climb\u2019 Postponed In Wake Of NY & LA Theater Closures|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1239931460519251968|title=Warm summer nights.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town is 41,011, an increase from 29,700 in [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. Dubbed the \"Upscale Tech Mecca\" of Southern Arizona by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' newspaper, Oro Valley is home to over 10 [[high tech]] firms and has a [[median household income]] nearly 50% higher than the [[Household income in the United States|U.S. median]]. The town is located approximately {{convert|110|mi|km}} southeast of the state capital of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nOro Valley is situated in the western foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] at the base of [[Pusch Ridge]]. The [[Tortolita Mountains]] are located north of the town, and vistas of the Tucson valley are to the south. The town occupies the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.  Oro Valley hosts a large number of residents from around the US who maintain second or winter homes in the town.\n\nThe town hosted the 2006 [[Pac-10]] Women's Golf Championships at the [[Oro Valley Country Club]]. Oro Valley Country Club was also the site for the 2006 Girl's Junior America's Cup, a major [[amateur]] [[golf tournament]] for the [[Western United States]]  Annual events in Oro Valley include the Oro Valley Festival of the Arts, El Tour de Tucson [[bicycle race]], the Tucson Marathon, the Cactus Speed Classic for [[inline skating|inline skaters]], and the Arizona Distance Classic.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Pre-U.S. annexation period===\nThe area of Oro Valley has been inhabited discontinuously for nearly two thousand years by various groups of people. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Hohokam]] tribe lived in the Honeybee Village in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains on Oro Valley's far north side around 450 A.D. Hohokam artifacts continue to be discovered in the Honeybee Village that the Hohokam inhabited continuously for nearly 800 years, and studied by archaeologists around the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orovalleyaz.gov/parksandrec/historic-preservation-cultural-resources/native-american-culture-and-history/honey-bee|title=Honey Bee Vilage|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Honey Bee Village {{!}} Oro Valley|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 16th century, Native American tribes known as the [[Apache]] arrived in the southern Arizona area, including Oro Valley. These tribes inhabited the region only a few decades prior to the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], including [[Francisco Coronado]]. The Spanish established [[forts]] in the area, including the Presidio at Tucson (1775) beginning in the late 16th century.\n\n===Arizona Territorial period===\nBeginning in the 19th century, Americans increasingly settled in the [[Arizona Territory]], following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the subsequent [[Gadsden Purchase]] including Southern Arizona. Following the Civil War and several Army efforts to pacify the Apaches, Tucson settlers ventured north to settle Oro Valley. Francisco Romero, from a Hispanic family tracing its Tucson roots to the early nineteenth century, established a ranch in what is Catalina State Park today by 1869.  He constructed ranch buildings on the foundations of the Hohokam ruins in the park. Romero lived there intermittently from 1869 to his death in 1905. Members of the Romero family occupied land in that same area until 1930. <Francisco Romero Biofile, Arizona Historical Society><Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGeorge Pusch, a [[German people|German]] immigrant, occupied land in the area of Oro Valley after 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the [[Ca\u00f1ada del Oro]]. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. Pusch and his family never lived on the ranch.  They visited frequently and employed caretakers to manage the property. George Pusch, and later the Pusch Land and Cattle Company, owned Steam Pump Ranch until 1925. Pusch's ranch provided respite for settlers and travelers entering and leaving the Tucson area. Pusch Ridge is named in honor of George Pusch.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n[[Ranching]]  continued to flourish in the area as greater numbers of Americans settled in the Arizona Territory and the state of Arizona. Federal homesteads became available after 1903 when surveys of land were completed. Homesteads were claimed by individuals from 1903 until the 1940s. Hispanic homesteaders included Francisco Romero, Jesus Elias, Francisco Marin, Francisco Aragon and others. Female homesteaders included Ina Gittings, Mabel Burke Johnson, Margaret Moodie and others.  Other prominent homesteaders included William Sutherland, James Reidy and David Morgan. <www.glorecords.gov>\n\nLarge ranching families came to the Oro Valley area in the period 1930-1960. Many of these were wealthy individuals from the Midwest and the East.  They vacationed in Tucson during the period and became interested in living in the desert. They purchased many of the homesteads occupied by original settlers who sold out after 1930.  These wealthy ranchers obtained properties of 1000 to 7000 acres.  They usually lived on the ranches in the winter months and employed caretakers to manage the property and cattle.  These wealthy ranchers included Walter McDonald, John Procter, Lawrence Rooney, Joseph McAdams and Lloyd and Betty Golder.<Williams,James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGold rushers into the [[American West]] also were attracted to [[southern Arizona]], where gold was said to be in abundance in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. Fueled by the legend of the lost Iron Door Gold Mine in the mountains, those in search of gold trekked through the Oro Valley area focusing their attention along the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro washbed.  No significant amounts of gold were found locally.\n\n===Post-World War II period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the Tucson area experienced dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. Property owners began subdividing local real estate for development in the early 1930s.  Construction of Campo Bello, the first suburban development, began in 1948. Lots in the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts were sold from the late 1930s to the 1960s and occupied by residents.  In the early 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club opened at the base of Pusch Ridge, affirming the area's future as an affluent community. The Suffolk Hills development was constructed in the period 1960-1962. Although one [[tract housing]] development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n===Founding of the town===\nThe community continued to grow gradually, and area residents increasingly desired local control of the land in the area. In the late 1960s, incorporation became a greater focus in Oro Valley.  Tucson Mayor James M. Corbett, Jr. expressed great interest in expanding the Tucson city limits to the far north side of [[Pima County]]. Corbett vowed to bring the Oro Valley area into Tucson \"kicking and screaming,\" alluding to the reservations Oro Valley residents expressed in joining Tucson.\n\nA petition to incorporate began circulation in Oro Valley in 1968. The Pima County Board of Supervisors officially refused to allow Oro Valley to incorporate, and litigation followed. Ultimately, the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of incorporation, and in 1974 the Town of Oro Valley was incorporated with only {{convert|2.4|sqmi|km2}}. The original town limits included the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts, Campo Bello Estates, Shadow Mountain Estates, and Oro Valley Country Club Estates. Activity in Oro Valley centered primarily around the Oro Valley Country Club and [[Canyon del Oro High School]]. While originally referred to as ''Palo Verde'', town founders proceeded with incorporation efforts with the official name of ''Oro Valley'' to garner support from influential residents of Oro Valley Country Club. The Town began with a population of nearly 1,200.\n\nThrough the 1980s and particularly in the 1990s Oro Valley experienced significant residential and commercial growth. In 1990 the town had a population of 6,670, and by 2000 that figure had increased to 29,700 residents. During that time, residential communities of all housing-unit densities were developed in the town, including several [[master-planned community|master-planned communities]]. For several years in the 1990s Oro Valley was the fastest growing municipality in Arizona.\n\n===Current state of the town===\nFormed by citizens of Oro Valley, the not-for-profit Oro Valley Historical Society has a mission in \"preserving the Town's heritage for future generations.\"\n\n==Geography==\n{{More citations needed section|date= October 2017}}\n[[File:Oro Valley Calle Concordia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Mountains rise in the background of a photo from a residential area in Oro Valley.|View towards Pusch Ridge from Calle Concordia.]]\n\nOro Valley is located at {{coord|32|25|N|110|59|W|type:city}} (32.4212, \u2212110.9760) in the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Oro Valley sits at an average elevation of {{convert|2620|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]] (2000), the town has a total area of {{convert|31.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|31.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.31%) is water.\n\nThe [[topography]] of Oro Valley is distinguished by the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro riverbed bisecting the town.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town is 41,011, an increase from 29,700 in [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. Dubbed the \"Upscale Tech Mecca\" of Southern Arizona by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' newspaper, Oro Valley is home to over 10 [[high tech]] firms and has a [[median household income]] nearly 50% higher than the [[Household income in the United States|U.S. median]]. The town is located approximately {{convert|110|mi|km}} southeast of the state capital of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nOro Valley is situated in the western foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] at the base of [[Pusch Ridge]]. The [[Tortolita Mountains]] are located north of the town, and vistas of the Tucson valley are to the south. The town occupies the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.  Oro Valley hosts a large number of residents from around the US who maintain second or winter homes in the town.\n\nThe town hosted the 2006 [[Pac-10]] Women's Golf Championships at the [[Oro Valley Country Club]]. Oro Valley Country Club was also the site for the 2006 Girl's Junior America's Cup, a major [[amateur]] [[golf tournament]] for the [[Western United States]]  Annual events in Oro Valley include the Oro Valley Festival of the Arts, El Tour de Tucson [[bicycle race]], the Tucson Marathon, the Cactus Speed Classic for [[inline skating|inline skaters]], and the Arizona Distance Classic.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Pre-U.S. annexation period===\nThe area of Oro Valley has been inhabited discontinuously for nearly two thousand years by various groups of people. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Hohokam]] tribe lived in the Honeybee Village in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains on Oro Valley's far north side around 450 A.D. Hohokam artifacts continue to be discovered in the Honeybee Village that the Hohokam inhabited continuously for nearly 800 years, and studied by archaeologists around the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orovalleyaz.gov/parksandrec/historic-preservation-cultural-resources/native-american-culture-and-history/honey-bee|title=Honey Bee Vilage|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Honey Bee Village {{!}} Oro Valley|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 16th century, Native American tribes known as the [[Apache]] arrived in the southern Arizona area, including Oro Valley. These tribes inhabited the region only a few decades prior to the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], including [[Francisco Coronado]]. The Spanish established [[forts]] in the area, including the Presidio at Tucson (1775) beginning in the late 16th century.\n\n===Arizona Territorial period===\nBeginning in the 19th century, Americans increasingly settled in the [[Arizona Territory]], following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the subsequent [[Gadsden Purchase]] including Southern Arizona. Following the Civil War and several Army efforts to pacify the Apaches, Tucson settlers ventured north to settle Oro Valley. Francisco Romero, from a Hispanic family tracing its Tucson roots to the early nineteenth century, established a ranch in what is Catalina State Park today by 1869.  He constructed ranch buildings on the foundations of the Hohokam ruins in the park. Romero lived there intermittently from 1869 to his death in 1905. Members of the Romero family occupied land in that same area until 1930. <Francisco Romero Biofile, Arizona Historical Society><Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGeorge Pusch, a [[German people|German]] immigrant, occupied land in the area of Oro Valley after 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the [[Ca\u00f1ada del Oro]]. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. Pusch and his family never lived on the ranch.  They visited frequently and employed caretakers to manage the property. George Pusch, and later the Pusch Land and Cattle Company, owned Steam Pump Ranch until 1925. Pusch's ranch provided respite for settlers and travelers entering and leaving the Tucson area. Pusch Ridge is named in honor of George Pusch.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n[[Ranching]]  continued to flourish in the area as greater numbers of Americans settled in the Arizona Territory and the state of Arizona. Federal homesteads became available after 1903 when surveys of land were completed. Homesteads were claimed by individuals from 1903 until the 1940s. Hispanic homesteaders included Francisco Romero, Jesus Elias, Francisco Marin, Francisco Aragon and others. Female homesteaders included Ina Gittings, Mabel Burke Johnson, Margaret Moodie and others.  Other prominent homesteaders included William Sutherland, James Reidy and David Morgan. <www.glorecords.gov>\n\nLarge ranching families came to the Oro Valley area in the period 1930-1960. Many of these were wealthy individuals from the Midwest and the East.  They vacationed in Tucson during the period and became interested in living in the desert. They purchased many of the homesteads occupied by original settlers who sold out after 1930.  These wealthy ranchers obtained properties of 1000 to 7000 acres.  They usually lived on the ranches in the winter months and employed caretakers to manage the property and cattle.  These wealthy ranchers included Walter McDonald, John Procter, Lawrence Rooney, Joseph McAdams and Lloyd and Betty Golder.<Williams,James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGold rushers into the [[American West]] also were attracted to [[southern Arizona]], where gold was said to be in abundance in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. Fueled by the legend of the lost Iron Door Gold Mine in the mountains, those in search of gold trekked through the Oro Valley area focusing their attention along the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro washbed.  No significant amounts of gold were found locally.\n\n===Post-World War II period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the Tucson area experienced dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. Property owners began subdividing local real estate for development in the early 1930s.  Construction of Campo Bello, the first suburban development, began in 1948. Lots in the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts were sold from the late 1930s to the 1960s and occupied by residents.  In the early 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club opened at the base of Pusch Ridge, affirming the area's future as an affluent community. The Suffolk Hills development was constructed in the period 1960-1962. Although one [[tract housing]] development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n===Founding of the town===\nThe community continued to grow gradually, and area residents increasingly desired local control of the land in the area. In the late 1960s, incorporation became a greater focus in Oro Valley.  Tucson Mayor James M. Corbett, Jr. expressed great interest in expanding the Tucson city limits to the far north side of [[Pima County]]. Corbett vowed to bring the Oro Valley area into Tucson \"kicking and screaming,\" alluding to the reservations Oro Valley residents expressed in joining Tucson.\n\nA petition to incorporate began circulation in Oro Valley in 1968. The Pima County Board of Supervisors officially refused to allow Oro Valley to incorporate, and litigation followed. Ultimately, the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of incorporation, and in 1974 the Town of Oro Valley was incorporated with only {{convert|2.4|sqmi|km2}}. The original town limits included the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts, Campo Bello Estates, Shadow Mountain Estates, and Oro Valley Country Club Estates. Activity in Oro Valley centered primarily around the Oro Valley Country Club and [[Canyon del Oro High School]]. While originally referred to as ''Palo Verde'', town founders proceeded with incorporation efforts with the official name of ''Oro Valley'' to garner support from influential residents of Oro Valley Country Club. The Town began with a population of nearly 1,200.\n\nThrough the 1980s and particularly in the 1990s Oro Valley experienced significant residential and commercial growth. In 1990 the town had a population of 6,670, and by 2000 that figure had increased to 29,700 residents. During that time, residential communities of all housing-unit densities were developed in the town, including several [[master-planned community|master-planned communities]]. For several years in the 1990s Oro Valley was the fastest growing municipality in Arizona.\n\n===Current state of the town===\nFormed by citizens of Oro Valley, the not-for-profit Oro Valley Historical Society has a mission in \"preserving the Town's heritage for future generations.\"\n\n==Geography==\n{{More citations needed section|date= October 2017}}\n[[File:Oro Valley Calle Concordia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Mountains rise in the background of a photo from a residential area in Oro Valley.|View towards Pusch Ridge from Calle Concordia.]]\n\nOro Valley is located at {{coord|32|25|N|110|59|W|type:city}} (32.4212, \u2212110.9760) in the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Oro Valley sits at an average elevation of {{convert|2620|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]] (2000), the town has a total area of {{convert|31.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|31.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.31%) is water.\n\nThe [[topography]] of Oro Valley is distinguished by the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro riverbed bisecting the town.
