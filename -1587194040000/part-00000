Some of the highest scores in the world are in the ballpark of 20,000; a dozen of players have scored more than 30,000; the average experienced player will average 14,000-16,000; and the occasional player will average 4,000-8,000. A first-time player can sometimes break 1,000.\n\nAs the player will run out of balls, they will lose eventually.

There are power-ups, such as giving the player an infinite supply of balls for a short time, turning all their balls explosive for a short time, or slowing time down for a short time.\n\nThere are also crystals (the small, blue [[polyhedron]]s) scattered throughout the map. By hitting a square [[pyramid]] with a ball, the player receives 3 balls;<ref name=\":0\" /> by hitting an [[octahedron]], 5 balls;<ref name=\":0\" /> and by hitting a 3D star, 10 balls.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the player hits 10 of these crystals in a row without missing any, they upgrade their multi-ball status.<ref name=\":0\" /> The player must hit 40 in a row to get to the maximum multi-ball from the single-ball default. The maximum number of balls the player can shoot with a single tap is 5. If the player hits an [[obstacle]] or misses any of the crystals, they lose all their multi-ball status and must regain it.\n\nOver time, the levels get more and more challenging.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the player completes all the checkpoints, there is an \"endless mode\" at the end, where the goal is to survive as long as possible, repeating the same course over and over. For every 0.1% through a checkpoint, 1 is added to the score. At the end of one checkpoint, the player will have gained 1,000 points.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the endless mode, the game still counts the points, except it is the same course (set of 4 different rooms) over and over rather than different courses. Some of the highest scores in the world are in the ballpark of 20,000; a dozen of players have scored more than 30,000; the average experienced player will average 14,000-16,000; and the occasional player will average 4,000-8,000. A first-time player can sometimes break 1,000.{{Original research inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nAs the player will run out of balls, they will lose eventually. The object of the game is how long it took for the player to lose, rather than if they won.{{Original research inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nMediocre has also released a version of the game for [[Samsung Gear VR]] titled '''Smash Hit VR'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uploadvr.com/smash-hit-even-better-vr/|title=Mobile success 'Smash Hit' is even better in VR - UploadVR|date=2015-10-09|work=UploadVR|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nSmash Hit received mostly positive reviews.

[[reality show]] that airs on the [[BOL Network]] and is hosted by [[Waqar Zaka]]. The episodes are also available online. The series premiered on 4 November 2019.\n\nFilming of the show took place at the ''Bol House'' in [[Korangi Creek Cantonment]], Karachi which partially serves as [[Bol Network]]'s headquarters. Contestants lived in the house for 30 days from 4 January to 4 February 2020 until four finalists emerged. The finale is scheduled to be filmed before the month of [[Ramadan]] which is expected to begin on the evening of 24 April 2020 in Pakistan.\n\n''Champions'' was the subject of viewer complaints and press attention regarding a variety of controversial issues, including vulagrity, the well-being of certain participants and discrimination based on [[sexuality]] and color. Despite receiving criticism for its graphic nature throughout its run, the series became one of the most-watched television telecast in Pakistan. The eighteenth episode of the series attracted 15 million viewers making it Bol Network's most-watched broadcast. As the series entered March viewership declined sharply amidst favoritism and [[clickbaiting]] complaints from audiences.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2017, he received an award from [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] for his social and humanitarian work in the war-torn areas of Syria and Myanmar.<ref>{{cite news|title=Waqar Zaka receives award from Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan|url=http://nation.com.pk/snippets/31-Mar-2017/waqar-zaka-receives-award-for-his-humanitarian-services|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name|6680650}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zaka, Waqar}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:VJs (media personalities)]]\n[[Category:Pakistani television hosts]]\n[[Category:People from Karachi]]\n[[Category:Pakistani stunt performers]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:People from Sargodha]]\n[[Category:NED University of Engineering and Technology alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pakistani television host, editor, actor, VJ, concept writer, director, producer}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name          = Waqar Zaka\n| nationality   = Pakistani\n| alma_mater    =\n| birth_place   = [[Sargodha]], [[Pakistan]]\n| occupation    = [[Television host]]\n| years_active  = 2005\u2013present\n| known_for     = [[Living on the Edge (Sabse Himmat Wala Kon?)|Living on the Edge]]<br>[[Champions Hosted By Waqar Zaka|Champions]]\n|website = http://waqarzaka.net\n}}\n\n'''Waqar Zaka''' is a Pakistani [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]]-turned-television host.<ref name=\"tribune/14feb2013\">{{cite news|title=I am giving Pakistanis a platform to vent their frustrations: Waqar Zaka - The Express Tribune|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/507331/i-am-giving-pakistanis-a-platform-to-vent-their-frustrations-waqar-zaka/|accessdate=1 July 2017|work=The Express Tribune|date=14 February 2013}}</ref> \n\n==Early life==\nZaka in an interview said he is an engineering graduate of [[NED University of Engineering & Technology]].<ref name=\"dailytimes1\" />\n\nWaqar began his career during his school life by releasing the student song ''Nahi Parha Meine Poora Saal'' and then became a [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]].

Six legal balls in a row constitutes an [[over (cricket)|over]], after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] toward the batsman standing at the opposite [[wicket]] at the other end of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]]. Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling [[Glossary of cricket terms#Around the wicket or round the wicket|around the wicket]] (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or [[Glossary of cricket terms#Over the wicket|over the wicket]], is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware.\n\nhttps://www.addyfitness.com/==Types of delivery==\n{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}\nDeliveries are basically made by [[Fast bowling|fast bowlers]] or by [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. Fast bowlers tend to make the ball either move off the pitch (\u2018[[Seam bowling|seam]]\u2019) or move through the air (\u2019[[Swing bowling|swing]]\u2019), while spinners make the ball \u2019turn\u2019 either toward a right-handed batsman (as in the case of [[off spin]] and [[left-arm unorthodox spin]]) or away from him (as in the case of [[leg spin]] and [[left-arm orthodox spin]]).\n\nThe ball can bounce at different distances from the batsman, this is called the ''[[Line and length|length]]'' of the delivery. It can range from a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] (often bouncing as high as the batsman's head) to a [[yorker]] (landing at his feet).\n\nThere are many different types of delivery that a bowler can bowl.

Six legal balls in a row constitutes an [[over (cricket)|over]], after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] toward the batsman standing at the opposite [[wicket]] at the other end of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]]. Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling [[Glossary of cricket terms#Around the wicket or round the wicket|around the wicket]] (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or [[Glossary of cricket terms#Over the wicket|over the wicket]], is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware.\n\n==Types of delivery==\n{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}\nDeliveries can be made by [[Fast bowling|fast bowlers]] or by [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. Fast bowlers tend to make the ball either move off the pitch (\u2018[[Seam bowling|seam]]\u2019) or move through the air (\u2019[[Swing bowling|swing]]\u2019), while spinners make the ball \u2019turn\u2019 either toward a right-handed batsman (as in the case of [[off spin]] and [[left-arm unorthodox spin]]) or away from him (as in the case of [[leg spin]] and [[left-arm orthodox spin]]).\n\nThe ball can bounce at different distances from the batsman, this is called the ''[[Line and length|length]]'' of the delivery. It can range from a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] (often bouncing as high as the batsman's head) to a [[yorker]] (landing at his feet).\n\nThere are many different types of delivery that a bowler can bowl. These deliveries vary by: technique, the hand the bowler bowls with, use of the fingers, use of the seam, how the ball is positioned in the hand, where the ball is pitched on the wicket, the speed of the ball, and the tactical intent of the bowler.\n\n*[[Leg spin]] deliveries and mirror equivalents for [[left arm unorthodox spin]]:\n** [[Leg break]]\n** [[Googly]]\n** [[Topspinner]]\n** [[Carrom ball|Flicker ball]]\n** [[Slider (cricket)|Slider]]\n** [[Flipper (cricket)|Flipper]]\n* [[Off spin]] deliveries and mirror equivalents for [[left arm orthodox spin]]:\n** [[Off break]]\n** [[Doosra]]\n** [[Topspinner]]\n** [[Carrom ball]]\n** [[Arm ball]]\n** [[Teesra]]\n* [[Fast bowling]] deliveries:\n** [[Bouncer (cricket)|Bouncer]]\n** [[Inswinger]]\n** [[Reverse swing]]\n** [[Leg cutter]]\n** [[Off cutter]]\n** [[Outswinger]]\n** [[Yorker]]\n** [[Beamer (cricket)|Beamer]] (illegal)\n**[[Knuckleball (cricket)|Knuckleball]]                                                    \n**[[Slower ball]]\n\n==Tactical considerations==\nThe variations in different types of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing [[line and length]], are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal.

Balachander]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Major Sundarrajan|Sundarrajan]], [[Srividya]] and [[Jayasudha]] while [[Nagesh]] and [[Rajinikanth]], in his debut, play supporting roles. It revolves around Prasanna (Haasan) who falls in love with the much older Bhairavi (Srividya) while Bhairavi's daughter Ranjani (Jayasudha) is drawn to Prasanna's father Mahendran (Sundarrajan). The rest of the story revolves around the four characters and their problems.\n\n''Apoorva Raagangal''{{'}}s theme was based on a riddle featured in the Indian folktale collection ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' about a king marrying a woman and his son marrying her mother, and [[Vetala]], the riddler asking [[Vikramaditya]] what would be their kinship relations if these couples were to beget children. The film was produced by V. Govindarajan and J. Duraisamy under Kalakendra Films, photographed by [[B. S. Lokanath]] and edited by N. R. Kittu; the music is composed by [[M. S. Viswanathan]]. Unlike many contemporaneous Tamil films, it was shot entirely in real houses for interiors without building sets, as Balachander wanted a more authentic narration to be conveyed.\n\n''Apoorva Raagangal'' was released on 18 August 1975. Despite exploring the concept of [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|relationships between people with wide age gaps]], which challenged Indian social mores, it received critical acclaim and became a commercial success, and a major breakthrough for Srividya and Haasan. The film won three [[National Film Awards]], including [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Best Feature Film in Tamil]], and three [[Filmfare Awards South]] in the Tamil branch: [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Best Feature Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Director]] for Balachander and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] for Haasan. It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Thoorpu Padamara]]'' (1976) where Srividya reprised her role, and in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Ek Nai Paheli]]'' (1984) where Balachander and Haasan reprised their duties.\n\n== Plot ==\nPrasanna is a youth who indulges in several revolutionary activities, against the wishes of his father, widower Mahendran. During one such activity, Mahendran helps the police arrest Prasanna, which widens the already existing rift between them. After his release, Prasanna opts to stay away from his hometown [[Bangalore]] and reaches [[Chennai|Madras]]. One day, Prasanna is beaten up for abusing the passengers of a car that splashed water on him. [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] singer Bhairavi, returning home after a [[katcheri]], notices him lying unconscious on the roadside, takes him home and gets him treated. At her request, Prasanna continues to live in her house even after recovering and slowly becomes very passionate about her, despite her being much older.\n\nBefore Prasanna's arrival, Bhairavi's adopted daughter Ranjani, who really believes she was adopted by Bhairavi, learns that she is actually Bhairavi's biological daughter born out of wedlock. Unable to digest her mother's hypocrisy, she runs away from home and meets Mahendran in Bangalore while trying to sell some items. She ends up staying at his house for a few days at his request. Impressed by his love for his deceased wife and longing for his son Prasanna who left him, and his commitment to help her, she expresses a desire to marry him, despite the fact that he is old enough to be her father.\n\nBoth Bhairavi and Mahendran reject the proposals of Prasanna and Ranjani, citing their age difference and other situations, but with perseverance, Prasanna and Ranjani are able to convince them on how their respective marriages can work. Bhairavi is forced to accept Prasanna's proposal when he ends his revolutionary activities and takes up music for her sake, becoming a [[mridangam]] player. When Prasanna is happy at getting Bhairavi's acceptance, Bhairavi's ex-lover Pandiyan, father of Ranjani, turns up to meet her and apologise. Prasanna does not allow him to meet her and, as Pandiyan is dying from [[Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues|blood cancer]], Prasanna takes him away for treatment at his place. He tells Pandiyan of his plan to marry Bhairavi and seeks his co-operation by not meeting her, to which Pandiyan agrees.\n\nMahendran, seeing an advertisement issued by Bhairavi about her missing daughter, comes to meet Bhairavi at her house and sees Prasanna's photograph there. He realises they are in love. Mahendran advertises about his missing son which Bhairavi sees, so she tells Prasanna to get his father's consent before marrying her. They both meet Mahendran, who introduces Ranjani as Prasanna's future mother since she is his future wife. A riddle is explained: Prasanna's wife will be the mother of his father's wife, meaning Ranjani will be the mother-in-law of her own mother and Mahendran will be the son-in-law of his own son. Mahendran asks Prasanna how this riddle is going to be cleared in their case.\n\nDuring Bhairavi's next katcheri, where Prasanna is a mridangam player, Bhairavi sings \"Kelviyin Nayagane, Indha Kelvikku Badhil Edhayya?\" (Oh hero of the question, what is the answer to this question?). Ranjani changes her mind course and joins her mother by singing in the concert. Observing this, Prasanna also changes his mind and joins his father. When all these issues are cleared, Pandiyan sends a note to Bhairavi in the middle of the katcheri. Bhairavi searches for him after the katcheri ends and finds him dead with a note in his hand, wishing her well with Prasanna. She erases the [[kumkuma]] from her forehead to declare herself a widow and leaves with Ranjani, while Prasanna joins Mahendran.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--In order of the film's opening credits-->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Prasanna\n* [[Major Sundarrajan|Sundarrajan]] as Mahendran\n* [[Srividya]] as Bhairavi\n* [[Jayasudha]] as Ranjani\n* [[Nagesh]] as Suri / Hari\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Pandiyan\n\nAdditionally, [[Kannadasan]], [[Jaishankar]] and members of the Madras-based United Amateur Artistes make \"friendly appearances\".{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page=35}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe Indian folktale collection ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' features many stories where the ghost-like being [[Vetala]] poses many riddles to [[Vikramaditya]], who does not answer Vetala's final riddle as it does not have one: a king marries a woman and his son marries her mother; Vetala asks, \"If these couples were to beget children, what would be their kinship relations?\" This riddle inspired [[K.

Balachander]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Major Sundarrajan|Sundarrajan]], [[Srividya]] and [[Jayasudha]] while [[Nagesh]] and [[Rajinikanth]], in his debut, play supporting roles. It revolves around Prasanna (Haasan) who falls in love with the much older Bhairavi (Srividya) while Bhairavi's daughter Ranjani (Jayasudha) is drawn to Prasanna's father Mahendran (Sundarrajan). The rest of the story revolves around the four characters and their problems.\n\n''Apoorva Raagangal''{{'}}s theme was based on a riddle featured in the Indian folktale collection ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' about a king marrying a woman and his son marrying her mother, and [[Vetala]], the riddler asking [[Vikramaditya]] what would be their kinship relations if these couples were to beget children. The film was produced by V. Govindarajan and J. Duraisamy under Kalakendra Films, photographed by [[B. S. Lokanath]] and edited by N. R. Kittu; the music is composed by [[M. S. Viswanathan]]. Unlike many contemporaneous Tamil films, it was shot entirely in real houses for interiors without building sets, as Balachander wanted a more authentic narration to be conveyed.\n\n''Apoorva Raagangal'' was released on 18 August 1975. Despite exploring the concept of [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|relationships between people with wide age gaps]], which challenged Indian social mores, it received critical acclaim and became a commercial success, and a major breakthrough for Srividya and Haasan. The film won three [[National Film Awards]], including [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Best Feature Film in Tamil]], and three [[Filmfare Awards South]] in the Tamil branch: [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Best Feature Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Director]] for Balachander and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] for Haasan. It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Thoorpu Padamara]]'' (1976) where Srividya reprised her role, and in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Ek Nai Paheli]]'' (1984) where Balachander and Haasan reprised their duties.\n\n== Plot ==\nPrasanna is a youth who indulges in several revolutionary activities, against the wishes of his father, widower Mahendran. During one such activity, Mahendran helps the police arrest Prasanna, which widens the already existing rift between them. After his release, Prasanna opts to stay away from his hometown [[Bangalore]] and reaches [[Chennai|Madras]]. One day, Prasanna is beaten up for abusing the passengers of a car that splashed water on him. [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] singer Bhairavi, returning home after a [[katcheri]], notices him lying unconscious on the roadside, takes him home and gets him treated. At her request, Prasanna continues to live in her house even after recovering and slowly becomes very passionate about her, despite her being much older.\n\nBefore Prasanna's arrival, Bhairavi's adopted daughter Ranjani, who really believes she was adopted by Bhairavi, learns that she is actually Bhairavi's biological daughter born out of wedlock. Unable to digest her mother's hypocrisy, she runs away from home and meets Mahendran in Bangalore while trying to sell some items. She ends up staying at his house for a few days at his request. Impressed by his love for his deceased wife and longing for his son Prasanna who left him, and his commitment to help her, she expresses a desire to marry him, despite the fact that he is old enough to be her father.\n\nBoth Bhairavi and Mahendran reject the proposals of Prasanna and Ranjani, citing their age difference and other situations, but with perseverance, Prasanna and Ranjani are able to convince them on how their respective marriages can work. Bhairavi is forced to accept Prasanna's proposal when he ends his revolutionary activities and takes up music for her sake, becoming a [[mridangam]] player. When Prasanna is happy at getting Bhairavi's acceptance, Bhairavi's ex-lover Pandiyan, father of Ranjani, turns up to meet her and apologise. Prasanna does not allow him to meet her and, as Pandiyan is dying from [[Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues|blood cancer]], Prasanna takes him away for treatment at his place. He tells Pandiyan of his plan to marry Bhairavi and seeks his co-operation by not meeting her, to which Pandiyan agrees.\n\nMahendran, seeing an advertisement issued by Bhairavi about her missing daughter, comes to meet Bhairavi at her house and sees Prasanna's photograph there. He realises they are in love. Mahendran advertises about his missing son which Bhairavi sees, so she tells Prasanna to get his father's consent before marrying her. They both meet Mahendran, who introduces Ranjani as Prasanna's future mother since she is his future wife. A riddle is explained: Prasanna's wife will be the mother of his father's wife, meaning Ranjani will be the mother-in-law of her own mother and Mahendran will be the son-in-law of his own son. Mahendran asks Prasanna how this riddle is going to be cleared in their case.\n\nDuring Bhairavi's next katcheri, where Prasanna is a mridangam player, Bhairavi sings \"Kelviyin Nayagane, Indha Kelvikku Badhil Edhayya?\" (Oh hero of the question, what is the answer to this question?). Ranjani changes her mind course and joins her mother by singing in the concert. Observing this, Prasanna also changes his mind and joins his father.
