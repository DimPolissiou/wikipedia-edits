Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the he [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Business leaders in the colony were disgruntled as well, and boosted production of goods not mentioned in the agreement to sell to the neutral United States at their standard market value.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=235}} In 1942, after the United States joined the Allies, the Belgian government negotiated a new economic agreement with the United States and United Kingdom.

At the outbreak of the war there were 302 doctors working in the Congo. Some medical personnel accompanied the Force Publique on its foreign deployments, but the vast majority remained in the colony for the conflict's duration. Unlike the neighboring French possessions, the war did not adversely affect the resources of healthcare providers in the Congo. Medical research continued and a new journal was created so that findings could be published while the territory was separated from Belgium.{{sfn|Pepin|2011|p=145}}\n\nFood remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government.<ref name=BCAW11/> Nevertheless, the war did lead to a shortage of consumer goods.{{sfn|Byfield et al.|2015|p=176}} The devaluation of the Congolese franc also made foreign imports more expensive.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=82}} One of the consequences of the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant [[urbanisation]].

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the he [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

The town began as a small community at the intersection of the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas]] (MKT) Railway and the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (a branch of the [[Missouri Pacific Railway]]), when William McAnally, a foreman for the MKT built a small hotel at this isolated location in June 1887. By the next summer others had built two more hotels and two general stores. The town was named for railroad dispatcher Henry \"Big Foot\" Wagoner, who had reported the need for a railroad switch nearby to accommodate the shipment of logs and hay. The switch had been previously named \"Wagoner's Switch.\" The switch soon relocated to the town and caused the development of a major cattle shipping business.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nBy 1894, the community had 642 names in a local census. A local newspaper began promoting the town in 1895, encouraging more people to move to there. By 1896, there were approximately 1,500 residents. In the fall of 1895, the community formed a commission that circulated a petition requesting incorporation under the statutes of Arkansas. Incorporation was granted by the U. S. District Court on January 4, 1896, making Wagoner the first city incorporated in Indian Territory.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nA privately funded courthouse was built in 1897, which housed a newly created U. S. Western District Court. The [[Dawes Commission]] turned Indian Territory land from tribal to individual ownership by members of each tribe. The individuals were allowed to sell their land to non-Indians, causing a real estate boom in farmland around the area. By statehood, the city had 2,950 residents and was named as the county seat of Wagoner County.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nIn April 1914 Wagoner was the location of a brutal lynching of a 17 year old African American girl and her parents. The paper reported that two half-drunken white men walked into her home during the absence of the mother and found the girl dressing.  The men locked themselves into her room and criminally assaulted her.  Her screams for help were heard by her brother, who, kicking down the door, went to her rescue.  In defending his sister, he shot one of the brutes.  The other escaped.  Later in the evening the local authorities, failing to find the brother, arrested the sister, who was taken from jail by a mob at 4 o'clock in the morning and lynched.  From his hiding place the brother, who was 21 years old, could hear his sister's cries for help, but was powerless to aid her.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ginzburg |first1=Ralph |title=100 Years of Lynchings |url=https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp |url-access=registration |date=1988 |publisher=Black Classic Press |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn= 978-0-933121-18-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp/page/90 90]}}</ref>\n\nThe boom continued through 1910, when the population reached 4,018. The MKT had located a division headquarters in the city, which then had three railroad trunk lines and twenty passenger trains a day. Industries included three grain elevators, a cotton gin, cotton oil mill, iron foundry, hardwood company, cement plant, and roller mill. However, the boom ended in 1913, when the MKT moved its division headquarters to Muskogee. The oil boom farther west and later, the Great Depression, caused a further decline in the city's economy and population.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nWorld War II started a revival of Wagoner's fortunes. The city lay between two war-related Federal Government projects: [[Camp Gruber]] to the south and the [[Oklahoma Ordnance Works]] to the north.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nAfter the war, several small manufacturing industries took root. Completion of the nearby [[Fort Gibson Lake]] in 1950 stimulated the economy and turned Wagoner into a sports and retirement center. The McLellan-Kerr navigational channel made the agricultural area accessible by barges, stimulating farm-related businesses. Highway improvements made Wagoner a bedroom community for Tulsa and Muskogee.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nWagoner is located at {{coord|35|57|20|N|95|22|41|W|type:city}} (35.955501, -95.377938).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is {{convert|18|mi|km}} north of [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] and {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of [[Tulsa]].<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 7,669 people, 2,928 households, and 2,111 families residing in the city.

The town began as a small community at the intersection of the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas]] (MKT) Railway and the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (a branch of the [[Missouri Pacific Railway]]), when William McAnally, a foreman for the MKT built a small hotel at this isolated location in June 1887. By the next summer others had built two more hotels and two general stores. The town was named for railroad dispatcher Henry \"Big Foot\" Wagoner, who had reported the need for a railroad switch nearby to accommodate the shipment of logs and hay. The switch had been previously named \"Wagoner's Switch.\" The switch soon relocated to the town and caused the development of a major cattle shipping business.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nBy 1894, the community had 642 names in a local census. A local newspaper began promoting the town in 1895, encouraging more people to move to there. By 1896, there were approximately 1,500 residents. In the fall of 1895, the community formed a commission that circulated a petition requesting incorporation under the statutes of Arkansas. Incorporation was granted by the U. S. District Court on January 4, 1896, making Wagoner the first city incorporated in Indian Territory.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nA privately funded courthouse was built in 1897, which housed a newly created U. S. Western District Court. The [[Dawes Commission]] turned Indian Territory land from tribal to individual ownership by members of each tribe. The individuals were allowed to sell their land to non-Indians, causing a real estate boom in farmland around the area. By statehood, the city had 2,950 residents and was named as the county seat of Wagoner County.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nIn April 1914 Wagner was the location of a brutal lynching of a 17 year old colored girl and her parents.  The paper reported that two half-drunken white men walked into her home during the absence of the mother and found the girl dressing.  The men locked themselves into her room and criminally assaulted her.  Her screams for help were heard by her brother, who, kicking down the door, went to her rescue.  In defending his sister, he shot one of the brutes.  The other escaped.  Later in the evening the local authorities, failing to find the brother, arrested the sister, who was taken from jail buy a mob at 4 o'clock in the morning and lynched.  From his hiding place the brother, who is 21 years old, could hear his sister's cries for help, but was powerless to aid her.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ginzburg |first1=Ralph |title=100 Years of Lynchings |url=https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp |url-access=registration |date=1988 |publisher=Black Classic Press |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn= 978-0-933121-18-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp/page/90 90]}}</ref>\n\nThe boom continued through 1910, when the population reached 4,018. The MKT had located a division headquarters in the city, which then had three railroad trunk lines and twenty passenger trains a day. Industries included three grain elevators, a cotton gin, cotton oil mill, iron foundry, hardwood company, cement plant, and roller mill. However, the boom ended in 1913, when the MKT moved its division headquarters to Muskogee. The oil boom farther west and later, the Great Depression, caused a further decline in the city's economy and population.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nWorld War II started a revival of Wagoner's fortunes. The city lay between two war-related Federal Government projects: [[Camp Gruber]] to the south and the [[Oklahoma Ordnance Works]] to the north.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nAfter the war, several small manufacturing industries took root. Completion of the nearby [[Fort Gibson Lake]] in 1950 stimulated the economy and turned Wagoner into a sports and retirement center. The McLellan-Kerr navigational channel made the agricultural area accessible by barges, stimulating farm-related businesses. Highway improvements made Wagoner a bedroom community for Tulsa and Muskogee.<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nWagoner is located at {{coord|35|57|20|N|95|22|41|W|type:city}} (35.955501, -95.377938).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is {{convert|18|mi|km}} north of [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] and {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of [[Tulsa]].<ref name = \"EOHC-Wagoner\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 7,669 people, 2,928 households, and 2,111 families residing in the city.

As the clues begin to unravel, the investigation gets more complicated when details of the man's private life are revealed, leading Brennan and Booth to a private detective who may hold key information. Meanwhile, Brennan is introduced to Dr. Camille Saroyan, a first-rate pathologist who has been hired as the head of forensics at the Jeffersonian, and more importantly, Brennan's boss. It doesn't take long for Brennan to figure out \"Cam\" is a little too familiar with Booth and they share something of a past.

The position of the pink robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nDescribed by Belgian naturalist [[Auguste Drapiez]] in 1819, the pink robin is a member of the Australasian robin family [[Petroicidae]], or Eopsaltridae.<ref name=Boles35>{{cite book |title=The Robins and Flycatchers of Australia |last=Boles |first=Walter E.|year=1988 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Sydney |isbn=0-207-15400-7|page=35}}</ref> [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and [[Jon Ahlquist|Ahlquist]]'s [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]] studies placed this group in a [[Corvida]] [[parvorder]] comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including [[Pardalotidae|pardalotes]], [[Maluridae|fairy-wrens]], [[Meliphagidae|honeyeaters]] and crows.<ref name=\"SibAhl\">{{cite book|vauthors=Sibley CG, Ahlquist JE |title=Phylogeny and Classification of Birds: A Study in Molecular Evolution |publisher= Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|year=1990|pages=603, 610\u201327|isbn=0-300-04085-7}}</ref> However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] (or \"advanced\" songbirds) within the [[songbird]] lineage.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Barker, F.
