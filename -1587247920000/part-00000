Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the very whaler ''Mary,'' as owned by John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, a Edward Reed Lacy, had named the island. The one entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, makes no mention of a discovery or a vessel ''Ph\u0153nix''.

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments.

Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities.

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J.

This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes.

The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty.

In late March, the 31 men tried their luck by putting to sea in the four open boats and made their way northwest for 49 days straight when finally they reached safety in [[Guam]], 2,900 nautical miles from where they had started.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LraODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=the+armchair+navigator&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuj6WOhsLkAhWNa1AKHSxFBeEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=The Armchair Navigator I|last=Dehner|first=Steve|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography, flora and fauna==\nKanton has been described as being shaped like a large pork chop.<ref name=\"JRi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.janeresture.com/kiribati_phoenix_group/canton.htm|title=Canton Island (Kanton - Abariringa) Phoenix Group, Kiribati|last=Resture|first=Jane|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> From its northwest to southeast points is a distance of {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while the land rim varies in width from {{convert|50|-|600|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|1.5|-|7|m|ft|abbr=on|round=5}} in elevation.

According to Edwin H. Bryan's ''American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain'', Kanton possessed in 1941 a total of twelve native species of vegetation, including low herbs and bunch grass, a thick stand of ''[[Scaevola (plant)|Scaevola]]'' shrubs on the island's south side ({{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} high), some ''[[Suriana|Suriana maritima]]'' shrubs near the lagoon entrance, heliotrope (''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]'') and kou (''[[Cordia subcordata]]'') trees, and [[coconut]] palms.<ref name=\"JRi\"/><ref>Bryan, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> [[Geoffrey Armstrong Buddle|Geoffrey Buddle]] of the New Zealand solar eclipse expedition of 1937 reported 23&nbsp;bird species on Kanton, together with [[Polynesian rat]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[hermit crab]]s and [[turtle]]s.

Rainwater is caught in cisterns; [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] had a large [[distillation]] [[Desalination|plant]] on the island when it operated there during the 1940s and 50s. Rainfall is sparse, averaging {{convert|8.71|-|35.97|in|mm|abbr=on}} between 1938 and 1953,<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 5.</ref> though later reports suggest a wetter climate in recent years.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Bulletins/04_Kantonresults.html.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===British claims===\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] laid claim to Kanton Island during the 1850s.<ref name=\"JRi\"/>  The official British claim was formally reasserted on 6&nbsp;August 1936, and an [[order in council]] issued in March&nbsp;1937 including Kanton and other [[Phoenix Islands]] in the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony, with the British making several visits to the island culminating in the placement of two radio operators on Kanton on 31&nbsp;August 1937.\n\n===Americans arrive===\n[[File:Kanton Island 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Rusting fire truck on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\nOn [[Solar eclipse of June 8, 1937|8&nbsp;June 1937]], Kanton was the site of a total [[solar eclipse]] and the island was occupied briefly by [[United States|American]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists, members of an expedition organized by the [[National Geographic Society]], and led by the [[astronomer]] [[Samuel Alfred Mitchell]]. During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[London]] quickly ordered no further escalation, and both parties observed the solar eclipse together, \"though officially a bit cool.\"<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn response to the British reoccupation of Kanton in August&nbsp;1937, seven Americans from the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]] landed on the island on 7&nbsp;March 1938. Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities. A United States office was open between 1940 and 1965 and from 1970.<ref name=\"Post Office\">{{Cite web  |last=Premier Postal History |title=Post Office List |publisher=Premier Postal Auctions |url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=ge&country= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Canton Island Post Office opened on 25&nbsp;January 1941 and closed around February 1968.\n\n===Airplane oasis===\n[[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) arrived on Kanton on 18&nbsp;May 1939, to build facilities for their planned [[New Zealand]] flying boat service.<ref name=\"JRi\"/> Service commenced on 12&nbsp;July 1940 with the [[Boeing 314 Clipper]].

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952\u20131956, during which time a crew from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine's January 1955 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Howell |title=Air age grings life to Canton Island |magazine=The [[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=January 1955 |pages=117\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nVice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife visited the island in October&nbsp;1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS.<ref>{{cite web |title=RNZI Airs new Radio Heritage Feature - The Lost Nixon Tape - KIBS Canton Island 1953 |publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.radioheritage.net/RHF_Media_Release_20121008_RNZI.pdf |date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds Historical - 16&nbsp;June 2013 - Show Notes - 8:23 Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Nixon |publisher=Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/soundshistorical |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  By 1956, Pan Am was operating a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to [[Sydney]] with a stop at [[Nadi Airport]] in [[Fiji]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com |date=1 July 1956 |title=Pan American World Airways system timetable}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Kanton's usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s&mdash;except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with [[Douglas DC-7C]] prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes. Kanton's airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.\n\n[[File:Kanton Island 02.jpg|thumb|left|House on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\n\n===After the airlines===\nIn 1960 a tracking station for the [[Mercury program]] was built on Kanton, and used through November&nbsp;1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty. Kanton's post office was reopened by the Kiribati government, and the island was repopulated with a few people from the more crowded atolls of the [[Gilbert Islands]], who reside in several of the abandoned residences left over from the Anglo-American presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d14/units/kukui/Kanton.htm |title=USCGC Kukui (WLB - 203)|author=|date=|website=www.uscg.mil|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKanton is occasionally visited by Republic of Kiribati vessels, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and various fishing boats.
