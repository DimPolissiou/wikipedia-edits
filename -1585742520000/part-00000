Many assume that Africans only wear [[Folk costume|traditional garb]] or using clothing solely functionally (to cover the body and protect it from environmental factors).<ref name=Heritage>{{Cite web|url=https://africanheritage.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/nigerian-fashion-through-the-years/|title=Nigerian Fashion: Through the Years|date=2007-01-12|website=African Heritage|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Yet, in many African countries, clothes have historically been decorative as well as scarring, painting, [[tattoo]]ing, or [[Jewellery|jewelry]].<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are definite distinctions between traditional Nigerian clothing and [[Western wear|Western clothing]] in Nigeria. Traditional clothing signifies which ethnic group one belongs to, and can indicate one's [[gender]], class, [[religion]], tribe and [[region]]. For instance, city and rural dwellers in Nigeria can easily distinguish [[Eastern Nigeria]]n ways of dressing from [[Northern Nigeria]]n or [[Western Nigeria]]n ways. This is because the different lifestyles call for different clothing styles.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-colonial fashion===\nNigerian traditional clothing has reflected the cultures of Nigeria's hundreds of ethnic groups. In pre-colonial times, Nigerians wore their traditional garb all of the time. In modern times, many Nigerians only wear traditional clothing for special occasions, or to work on Fridays, and also for religious gatherings e.g. in the church or the mosque.\n\n==== Edo nation ====\n[[File:Theatre_art_class_of_2013,_Unilag.jpg|thumb|Edo people in traditional clothing]]\n\nThe [[Edo people|Edo People]] are made up of the Binis, Afemais, Esan, etc. The [[Benin Kingdom]] is one of the oldest and culturally rich pre-colonial African Kingdoms. Edo traditional clothing has lots of color and the people often wear beads, which symbolize royalty and freedom.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==== Urhobo/Isoko Nation ====\nThe [[Urhobo people]] and [[Isoko people]] are major ethnic groups in Nigeria's [[Delta State]], migrants from the Edo nation, according to oral history. Combined, they make up the fifth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have very similar languages, cultures, and traditional clothing. Many wear Georgian wrappers and lace shirts, accessorized with cowboy hats, walking sticks, and beads on the hands and neck.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==== Yoruba Nation ====\n[[File:A_Nigerian_Yoruba_Bride.JPG|thumb|A Yoruba bride]]\n\nThe [[Yoruba people|Yoruba People]] occupy South Western and North-Central Nigeria, living in such states as [[Lagos State|Lagos]], [[Oyo State|Oyo]], [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]], [[Kwara State|Kwara]], [[Kogi State|Kogi]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Ogun State|Ogun]], and [[Osun State|Osun]]. They are one of the three major ethnic groups of Nigeria. The Yoruba men traditionally wear a \"[[Buba (garment)|Buba]]\" and \"[[Sokoto (garment)|Sokoto]]\", sometimes with an \"[[Agbada]]\", an oversized cloth worn like a jacket and a \"[[Fila (garment)|Fila]]\", a traditional cap. Women on the other hand wear a \"Buba\" and \"[[Iro (garment)|Iro]]\" and tie a \"[[Head tie|Gele]]\" over their heads and \"[[Ipele (garment)|Ipele]]\" over the shoulders. The Gele and Ipele must match. \"Buba\" is like a shirt for men and a low round neck top for women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ng.ewtnet.com/lifestyle/nigerian-ethnic-groups-and-their-traditional-attires/|title=Nigerian Ethnic Groups and their Traditional attires|date=2019-03-14|website=EwtNet Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==== Igbo Nation ====\n[[File:Ude_Oko_Chukwu.jpg|thumb|235x235px|An Igbo man]]\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo People\u2014]]<nowiki/>an umbrella term for groups such as [[Mbaise]], Ika, Aniocha, [[Ikwerre people|Ikwerre]](disputed), and Orlu\u2014occupy South Eastern and parts of South-Southern Nigeria, living in such states as [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Delta State|Delta]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]].

Their dress resembles that of the Igbo people, with some major differences.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==== Ijaw Nation ====\nThe [[Ijaw people]] occupy [[Bayelsa State|Bayelsa]], Rivers, Delta, Akwa-Ibom and Ondo States. They make up the fourth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have cultural similarities with the neighbouring Itsekiri and Urhobo/Isoko people and dress like them.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==== Itsekiri Nation ====\nThe [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]] are a minority ethnic group whose people occupy Delta South. Itsekiris live in [[Warri North]], [[Warri South]], [[Warri South West]], and [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]]. The Itsekiris were originally Yoruba people, but migrated and mixed with the Edo, Urhobo, and Ijaw people as well as the Portuguese. Itsekiris dress like the Urhobos and Ijaws. Their royalty put on white with a colored girdle depending on the occasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Colonial and post-colonial fashion ===\nDuring colonialism and into the modern period, Nigerians slowly began to adopt Western styles of dress, including blouses, skirts, dress pants, and wigs. This transition was especially prevalent in schools and government, however fashion in the rural areas has not changed significantly over this period.\n\nIn his 1971 song, \"Gentleman,\" [[Fela Kuti]] mocked Nigerians who rejected their native garb for English suits when they achieved success.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> His confident lyrics, \"I no be gentleman at all-o, I be Africa man, original\", provided commentary on those who had inferiority complexes about their non-Western cultures and lost their roots.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/music-is-the-weapon-the-10-rarest-fela-kuti-records/|title=Music Is The Weapon: The 10 essential Fela Kuti records - The Vinyl Factory|website=www.thevinylfactory.com|access-date=2016-11-30|date=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOver time, Nigerian fashion began to mirror the country's status as an independent nation.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Nigerians embraced traditional clothing in urban areas, professional work environments, and church.\n\n== Textiles and weaving ==\nWeaving in Nigeria is traced to Eastern Nigeria. Archaeological evidence of early textiles supposedly woven from brass and leaf fibers has been discovered and they date over a thousand years. But whether strips were woven simultaneously or individually is difficult to say, as no further evidence was available to corroborate this.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nKano cloths is the 1590s, was said to be used as currency. Researchers such as Barth (1851) observed that dyed and woven cotton were the main products of Kano. He described over 20 different kinds of cloth made in Kano and all its environs.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nDuring the later part of 1800s, locally woven fabrics were exported to other parts of Nigeria and other countries. This was sadly reduced by the large imports of printed cloth from England, which could be purchased more cheaply than hand-woven fabrics. Still, the hand woven cloth remains treasured for important ceremonies and events. This was bolstered by the nationalism generated by the independence in 1960.<ref name=Heritage/>\n[[File:Ankara_monostrap_dress.jpg|thumb|302x302px|Example of an ankara dress]]\nThere are two primary types of weaving done on two different types of looms, in Nigeria, especially in the Western region. While men and youth use a narrow, horizontal loom with meddles and treadles to weave strips of cloth infinite yardage, the women are primarily responsible for growing and processing the fibre for weaving. In towns like Oyo and Ilorin, the people plant, cultivate and harvest cotton fibres. They also spin and dye.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nAnkara fabric, not referring to the capital of Turkey of the same name, is a 100% cotton fabric filled with vibrant patterns and African motifs. It is commonly referred to as Dutch wax or Holland wax, African print, or African wax prints.<ref name=Ankara>{{Cite news|url=http://www.allthingsankara.com/2014/09/wax-print-what-is-ankara-what-is-ankara-fabric.html|title=Wax Print: What is Ankara? ... What is Ankara Fabric?|date=2014-09-19|newspaper=All Things Ankara|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Ankara print Fabrics are  made through an Indonesian wax-resist dyeing technique called Batik.In this technique, methods are used to \"resist\" the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern. The lack of divergence in color intensity helps with the determination of the (front) right and (back) wrong side of the fabric. Ankara print fabrics are most often sold in 12 yards as \"full piece\" or 6 yards as \"half piece\". The fabric company/producer, The type of fabric/product and registration number is printed on the selvage of the fabric, to notify people of the quality and to protect the designs from imitators.<ref name=Ankara/>\n\nThe wax fabric can be sorted into categories of quality due to the processes of manufacturing. The colors comply with the local preferences of the costumers.  Some wax prints can be named after personalities, cities, building, sayings or occasions.<ref name=Ankara/> The Nigerian textile industry is very strong, and nearly all the cloth produced in Nigeria goes to clothing the large Nigerian population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmKMUM7|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAnkara Print fabrics can be worn for both regular outings, and some people wear it as \"aso ebi\" for special occasions such as birthday celebrations, weddings, balls, etc. Aso ebi is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word and means \"clothes of the family\". Family members, relatives and close friends usually dress up in the same print for a special occasion.<ref name=Ankara/>\n\nThere has also been a reawakening of Nigerians to fashionably embrace local fabrics like aso-oke,<ref>Agbadudu, A.B. and Ogunrin, F.O. (2006) \u2018Aso\u2010oke: A Nigerian classic style and fashion fabric\u2019, ''Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal'', 10(1), pp. 97\u2013113. doi: 10.1108/13612020610651150.</ref> adire, and Nigerian wax. Some designers, like [[Ituen Basi]], opt to only use Nigerian wax in their designs; she has even designed a line of ankara footwear, jewelry, bags, and accessories. Nowadays, Ankara fabrics can be used to make suits, jumpsuits, short gwons, playsuits, sneakers, bags, shoes, earrings, bracelets, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sveltemag.com/ankara-fabric/|title=Ankara Fabric: All You Need to Know|last=Victoria|first=Willie|date=Feb 19, 2020|website=Svelte Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This print craze recently caught on with the Western fashion world and this time, Africa, specifically Nigeria, has become a major muse.<ref name=stylehousefiles/>\n\n== Embroidery ==\nEmbroidery is like a stamp of African aesthetic on an outfit. Modern designs are given exotic embroidery patterns in order to marry western and African imprints. The history of embroidery in Nigeria dates back to centuries, and it has become integral part of Nigerian dressing. Among the Nupe and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] research has proved that embroidery has been a long tradition and it is used on many types of garments, from Hausa farmers cloths to riding robes and ceremonial apparels.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe embroidery done on men's clothes is traditionally made with dark stitches with asymmetrical and non-representational designs. Gorgeously, voluminous robes, intricately embroidered are a symbol of prestige and rank for men in Nupe and Hausa communities. Designs of the Nupe embroiders are well known and prized by Nupe and Hausa people. Three types of stitches are primarily used. They are the chain stitch, the buttonhole stitch and couching. The stitching is done with either imported or silk thread on either imported or hand-woven cloth. Often, silk thread in its own creamy color called Tsmia in Hausa is used for the most prestigious Rigona robes on hand-woven narrow band cloth which is most times, creamy in color.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are still other types of embroidery designs in the country. These embroidered cloths are used as bedspread, tablecloth or wall hangings. Some artists say the colorful and cheerful cloths are the examples of \"folk art\". But the Hausa call it \"Hausa bridal sheets\". What is note worthy in these cloths is that the embroidery designs and traditional house decorations have similar motifs.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nEmbroidery was not also natural to the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] but surface designs for body paintings were easily converted to embroidery designs for table linens in the Igbo town of [[Arochukwu]]. [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] men have also used some embroidery on clothing, round the neck of their traditional [[agbada]].<ref name=Heritage/>\n\n== Headgear ==\nThere was time in Nigeria when headgear popularly called \"gele\" (another [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word) was almost compulsory for Nigerian women. In the 1950s and 1960s, gele was for the fashion diva of that time, the ultimate headgear. The women proudly wore gele to the admiration of other women from other climes.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe glory of gele was however, highest in 1960, the year of Independence. Lagos was agog that year and to reflect the festive mood, Nigerian women wasted no time in upgrading the fashion to catch the euphoria of the moment. Different headgears also came in with the euphoria one of which was Onilegororo. This was one of the sky-scrapping head gears and it marked a new level of sophistication and the status symbol for society women. Today the members of the wealthy elite are easily identifiable by their fancy clothing and hairstyles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmxlPtQ|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Onilegororo, after the independence, was quickly replaced by Flora Azikiwe, the style, in honour of late First Lady and wife of the president of the new republic. From then, it became the vogue to name headgears after public edifices and personalities, from [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] to [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], [[Yakubu Gowon|Yakubu Gown]], [[Eko Bridge]] and [[National Electric Power Authority in Nigeria|National Electric Power Authority]] (NEPA). NEPA, patterned after the statute of [[Sango, The God-King|Sango]], god of thunder and lightning, which is the logo for NEPA, came into being in the 70s as a mark of recognition of the once mighty corporation. In appreciation of the beauty and architectural excellence of the National Theatre, a replica was fashioned by the lists which became known is National Theatre headgear.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nBut after the euphoria of independence warned, the love for headgear waned too. By the 1980s, following the ban on importation, the inflow of headgears reduced dramatically and with it, the imagination of the ingenious stylists whose fort it was to come up will names and styles. The [[Structural Adjustment Programme]] (SAP) played a significant role in demise of the gele. The fall of the national currency, the [[Nigerian naira|naira]], forced the prices of gele out of the reach of the average Nigerian woman. The urge then was to satisfy the stomach. This out weighed the desire to spend some time for fashion, as it also required expensive accessory. Gele, to many people, became an occasional wear for Sundays, parties, weddings and other special occasions.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe changing circumstances in the affairs of the gele gave way to a deeper westernization of the average Nigerian teenager's dressing that very rarely do young women wear gele or traditional attire show in their wardrobe. So, while the gele is for grand occasions like the Christmas and special events, the vogue for her is the hat, the ultimate headpiece. The anger against this is not the appreciation of western dressing but the total rejection for what is African. This danger has perhaps, made some fashion hat designers create a modern version of the gele.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nFurther researches and studies in the art of hat making have led to the introduction of relevant and constant invitations. The innovations have made hats come to stay as part of modern Nigerian fashion, leading to introduction of \"group hats\", uniform hats. Hats are made of different materials such as cynamay, a soft material dyed into a variety of colors and shades. Cynamay can be moved, twisted and cut into different shapes. It is light and suitable for the African weather.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are also straw hats, the knotted style and the pail boxes. Some are designed with feathers and flowers such as roses and ornament, like sequins. About 80 per cent of the materials are imported. But the preferred hat colors, many people say, are silver, gold and platinum. But hat the colors in vogue are hot pink, lemon and orange.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\n== Notable fashion designers and houses ==\nNigerian publications such as ''Flair West Africa'' (formerly called ''True Love'' Magazine), ''Genevieve'', ''TW'' and ''Arise''; websites like Stylehousefiles.com, Bellanaija.com, Sveltemag.com, Ladybrille.com, Fashionafrica.com, Shopliquorice.blogspot.com, showcase and promote Nigerian fashion.<ref name=stylehousefiles/> Nigerian fashion has created female entrepreneurs and has improved the Nigerian economy by creating jobs and opportunities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Madichie|first=Nnamdi|year=2009|title=Breaking the Glass Ceiling in Nigeria: A Review of Women's Entrepreneurship|journal=Journal of African Business|volume=10|pages=51\u201366|doi=10.1080/15228910802701361}}</ref>\n\nThe Nigerian fashion industry according to designer Maki-Oh suffers from, \"Mediocrity, electricity [problems] and quality control.\" There are no bodies regulating the fashion industry and there are no government incentives to support newcomers.  There are issues of finishing which nearly every designer suffers from as most of them rely on self-taught tailors. The result is an expensive price tag for less than perfect products.<ref name=stylehousefiles/>\n\nHelen Jennings notes, \"the success of the new generation of designers, models and fashion scenes around Africa is a reflection of Africa's success as a whole. The continent is gradually emerging as a global power thanks to increased trade and investment between Africa and the rest of the world and improved political stability and economic growth in burgeoning democracies such as Nigeria.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.randomhouse.de/leseprobe/New-African-Fashion-(US-Version)/leseprobe_9783791345796.pdf|title=New African Fashion|last=Jennings|first=Helen|date=|website=Random House|publisher=Prestel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) is the recognized body for the Fashion Designers Profession and was duly incorporated in 1989 by the then Federal Ministry of Trade and Corporate Affairs.

Many assume that Africans only wear [[Folk costume|traditional garb]] or using clothing solely functionally (to cover the body and protect it from environmental factors).<ref name=Heritage>{{Cite web|url=https://africanheritage.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/nigerian-fashion-through-the-years/|title=Nigerian Fashion: Through the Years|date=2007-01-12|website=African Heritage|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Yet, in many African countries, clothes have historically been decorative as well as scarring, painting, [[tattoo]]ing, or [[Jewellery|jewelry]].<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are definite distinctions between traditional Nigerian clothing and [[Western wear|Western clothing]] in Nigeria. Traditional clothing signifies which ethnic group one belongs to, and can indicate one's [[gender]], class, [[religion]], tribe and [[region]]. For instance, city and rural dwellers in Nigeria can easily distinguish [[Eastern Nigeria]]n ways of dressing from [[Northern Nigeria]]n or [[Western Nigeria]]n ways. This is because the different lifestyles call for different clothing styles.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-colonial fashion===\nNigerian traditional clothing has reflected the cultures of Nigeria's hundreds of ethnic groups. In pre-colonial times, Nigerians wore their traditional garb all of the time. In modern times, many Nigerians only wear traditional clothing for special occasions, or to work on Fridays, and also for religious gatherings e.g. in the church or the mosque.\n\n==== Edo nation ====\n[[File:Theatre_art_class_of_2013,_Unilag.jpg|thumb|Edo people in traditional clothing]]\n\nThe [[Edo people|Edo People]] are made up of the Binis, Afemais, Esan, etc. The [[Benin Kingdom]] is one of the oldest and culturally rich pre-colonial African Kingdoms.

Combined, they make up the fifth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have very similar languages, cultures, and traditional clothing. Many wear Georgian wrappers and lace shirts, accessorized with cowboy hats, walking sticks, and beads on the hands and neck.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==== Yoruba Nation ====\n[[File:A_Nigerian_Yoruba_Bride.JPG|thumb|A Yoruba bride]]\n\nThe [[Yoruba people|Yoruba People]] occupy South Western and North-Central Nigeria, living in such states as [[Lagos State|Lagos]], [[Oyo State|Oyo]], [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]], [[Kwara State|Kwara]], [[Kogi State|Kogi]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Ogun State|Ogun]], and [[Osun State|Osun]]. They are one of the three major ethnic groups of Nigeria. The Yoruba men traditionally wear a \"[[Buba (garment)|Buba]]\" and \"[[Sokoto (garment)|Sokoto]]\", sometimes with an \"[[Agbada]]\", an oversized cloth worn like a jacket and a \"[[Fila (garment)|Fila]]\", a traditional cap. Women on the other hand wear a \"Buba\" and \"[[Iro (garment)|Iro]]\" and tie a \"[[Head tie|Gele]]\" over their heads and \"[[Ipele (garment)|Ipele]]\" over the shoulders.

Itsekiris live in [[Warri North]], [[Warri South]], [[Warri South West]], and [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]]. The Itsekiris were originally Yoruba people, but migrated and mixed with the Edo, Urhobo, and Ijaw people as well as the Portuguese. Itsekiris dress like the Urhobos and Ijaws. Their royalty put on white with a colored girdle depending on the occasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Colonial and post-colonial fashion ===\nDuring colonialism and into the modern period, Nigerians slowly began to adopt Western styles of dress, including blouses, skirts, dress pants, and wigs. This transition was especially prevalent in schools and government, however fashion in the rural areas has not changed significantly over this period.\n\nIn his 1971 song, \"Gentleman,\" [[Fela Kuti]] mocked Nigerians who rejected their native garb for English suits when they achieved success.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> His confident lyrics, \"I no be gentleman at all-o, I be Africa man, original\", provided commentary on those who had inferiority complexes about their non-Western cultures and lost their roots.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/music-is-the-weapon-the-10-rarest-fela-kuti-records/|title=Music Is The Weapon: The 10 essential Fela Kuti records - The Vinyl Factory|website=www.thevinylfactory.com|access-date=2016-11-30|date=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOver time, Nigerian fashion began to mirror the country's status as an independent nation.<ref name=\"Blanck\">{{cite web |last1=Odusola |first1=Abiodun |title=Independence Day Special: The Evolution of Nigerian Fashion Since 1960 |url=https://www.blanckdigital.com/independence-day-special-the-evolution-of-nigerian-fashion-since-1960/ |website=blanckdigital.com |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Nigerians embraced traditional clothing in urban areas, professional work environments, and church.\n\n== Textiles and weaving ==\nWeaving in Nigeria is traced to Eastern Nigeria. Archaeological evidence of early textiles supposedly woven from brass and leaf fibers has been discovered and they date over a thousand years. But whether strips were woven simultaneously or individually is difficult to say, as no further evidence was available to corroborate this.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nKano cloths is the 1590s, was said to be used as currency. Researchers such as Barth (1851) observed that dyed and woven cotton were the main products of Kano. He described over 20 different kinds of cloth made in Kano and all its environs.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nDuring the later part of 1800s, locally woven fabrics were exported to other parts of Nigeria and other countries. This was sadly reduced by the large imports of printed cloth from England, which could be purchased more cheaply than hand-woven fabrics. Still, the hand woven cloth remains treasured for important ceremonies and events. This was bolstered by the nationalism generated by the independence in 1960.<ref name=Heritage/>\n[[File:Ankara_monostrap_dress.jpg|thumb|302x302px|Example of an ankara dress]]\nThere are two primary types of weaving done on two different types of looms, in Nigeria, especially in the Western region. While men and youth use a narrow, horizontal loom with meddles and treadles to weave strips of cloth infinite yardage, the women are primarily responsible for growing and processing the fibre for weaving. In towns like Oyo and Ilorin, the people plant, cultivate and harvest cotton fibres. They also spin and dye.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nAnkara fabric, not referring to the capital of Turkey of the same name, is a 100% cotton fabric filled with vibrant patterns and African motifs. It is commonly referred to as Dutch wax or Holland wax, African print, or African wax prints.<ref name=Ankara>{{Cite news|url=http://www.allthingsankara.com/2014/09/wax-print-what-is-ankara-what-is-ankara-fabric.html|title=Wax Print: What is Ankara? ... What is Ankara Fabric?|date=2014-09-19|newspaper=All Things Ankara|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Ankara print Fabrics are  made through an Indonesian wax-resist dyeing technique called Batik.In this technique, methods are used to \"resist\" the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern. The lack of divergence in color intensity helps with the determination of the (front) right and (back) wrong side of the fabric. Ankara print fabrics are most often sold in 12 yards as \"full piece\" or 6 yards as \"half piece\". The fabric company/producer, The type of fabric/product and registration number is printed on the selvage of the fabric, to notify people of the quality and to protect the designs from imitators.<ref name=Ankara/>\n\nThe wax fabric can be sorted into categories of quality due to the processes of manufacturing. The colors comply with the local preferences of the costumers.  Some wax prints can be named after personalities, cities, building, sayings or occasions.<ref name=Ankara/> The Nigerian textile industry is very strong, and nearly all the cloth produced in Nigeria goes to clothing the large Nigerian population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmKMUM7|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAnkara Print fabrics can be worn for both regular outings, and some people wear it as \"aso ebi\" for special occasions such as birthday celebrations, weddings, balls, etc. Aso ebi is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word and means \"clothes of the family\". Family members, relatives and close friends usually dress up in the same print for a special occasion.<ref name=Ankara/>\n\nThere has also been a reawakening of Nigerians to fashionably embrace local fabrics like aso-oke,<ref>Agbadudu, A.B. and Ogunrin, F.O. (2006) \u2018Aso\u2010oke: A Nigerian classic style and fashion fabric\u2019, ''Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal'', 10(1), pp. 97\u2013113. doi: 10.1108/13612020610651150.</ref> adire, and Nigerian wax. Some designers, like [[Ituen Basi]], opt to only use Nigerian wax in their designs; she has even designed a line of ankara footwear, jewelry, bags, and accessories. Nowadays, Ankara fabrics can be used to make suits, jumpsuits, short gwons, playsuits, sneakers, bags, shoes, earrings, bracelets, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sveltemag.com/ankara-fabric/|title=Ankara Fabric: All You Need to Know|last=Victoria|first=Willie|date=Feb 19, 2020|website=Svelte Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This print craze recently caught on with the Western fashion world and this time, Africa, specifically Nigeria, has become a major muse.<ref name=stylehousefiles/>\n\n== Embroidery ==\nEmbroidery is like a stamp of African aesthetic on an outfit. Modern designs are given exotic embroidery patterns in order to marry western and African imprints. The history of embroidery in Nigeria dates back to centuries, and it has become integral part of Nigerian dressing. Among the Nupe and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] research has proved that embroidery has been a long tradition and it is used on many types of garments, from Hausa farmers cloths to riding robes and ceremonial apparels.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe embroidery done on men's clothes is traditionally made with dark stitches with asymmetrical and non-representational designs. Gorgeously, voluminous robes, intricately embroidered are a symbol of prestige and rank for men in Nupe and Hausa communities. Designs of the Nupe embroiders are well known and prized by Nupe and Hausa people. Three types of stitches are primarily used. They are the chain stitch, the buttonhole stitch and couching. The stitching is done with either imported or silk thread on either imported or hand-woven cloth. Often, silk thread in its own creamy color called Tsmia in Hausa is used for the most prestigious Rigona robes on hand-woven narrow band cloth which is most times, creamy in color.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are still other types of embroidery designs in the country. These embroidered cloths are used as bedspread, tablecloth or wall hangings. Some artists say the colorful and cheerful cloths are the examples of \"folk art\". But the Hausa call it \"Hausa bridal sheets\". What is note worthy in these cloths is that the embroidery designs and traditional house decorations have similar motifs.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nEmbroidery was not also natural to the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] but surface designs for body paintings were easily converted to embroidery designs for table linens in the Igbo town of [[Arochukwu]]. [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] men have also used some embroidery on clothing, round the neck of their traditional [[agbada]].<ref name=Heritage/>\n\n== Headgear ==\nThere was time in Nigeria when headgear popularly called \"gele\" (another [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word) was almost compulsory for Nigerian women. In the 1950s and 1960s, gele was for the fashion diva of that time, the ultimate headgear. The women proudly wore gele to the admiration of other women from other climes.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe glory of gele was however, highest in 1960, the year of Independence. Lagos was agog that year and to reflect the festive mood, Nigerian women wasted no time in upgrading the fashion to catch the euphoria of the moment. Different headgears also came in with the euphoria one of which was Onilegororo. This was one of the sky-scrapping head gears and it marked a new level of sophistication and the status symbol for society women. Today the members of the wealthy elite are easily identifiable by their fancy clothing and hairstyles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmxlPtQ|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Onilegororo, after the independence, was quickly replaced by Flora Azikiwe, the style, in honour of late First Lady and wife of the president of the new republic. From then, it became the vogue to name headgears after public edifices and personalities, from [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] to [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], [[Yakubu Gowon|Yakubu Gown]], [[Eko Bridge]] and [[National Electric Power Authority in Nigeria|National Electric Power Authority]] (NEPA). NEPA, patterned after the statute of [[Sango, The God-King|Sango]], god of thunder and lightning, which is the logo for NEPA, came into being in the 70s as a mark of recognition of the once mighty corporation. In appreciation of the beauty and architectural excellence of the National Theatre, a replica was fashioned by the lists which became known is National Theatre headgear.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nBut after the euphoria of independence warned, the love for headgear waned too. By the 1980s, following the ban on importation, the inflow of headgears reduced dramatically and with it, the imagination of the ingenious stylists whose fort it was to come up will names and styles. The [[Structural Adjustment Programme]] (SAP) played a significant role in demise of the gele. The fall of the national currency, the [[Nigerian naira|naira]], forced the prices of gele out of the reach of the average Nigerian woman. The urge then was to satisfy the stomach. This out weighed the desire to spend some time for fashion, as it also required expensive accessory. Gele, to many people, became an occasional wear for Sundays, parties, weddings and other special occasions.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThe changing circumstances in the affairs of the gele gave way to a deeper westernization of the average Nigerian teenager's dressing that very rarely do young women wear gele or traditional attire show in their wardrobe. So, while the gele is for grand occasions like the Christmas and special events, the vogue for her is the hat, the ultimate headpiece. The anger against this is not the appreciation of western dressing but the total rejection for what is African. This danger has perhaps, made some fashion hat designers create a modern version of the gele.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nFurther researches and studies in the art of hat making have led to the introduction of relevant and constant invitations. The innovations have made hats come to stay as part of modern Nigerian fashion, leading to introduction of \"group hats\", uniform hats. Hats are made of different materials such as cynamay, a soft material dyed into a variety of colors and shades. Cynamay can be moved, twisted and cut into different shapes. It is light and suitable for the African weather.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThere are also straw hats, the knotted style and the pail boxes. Some are designed with feathers and flowers such as roses and ornament, like sequins. About 80 per cent of the materials are imported. But the preferred hat colors, many people say, are silver, gold and platinum. But hat the colors in vogue are hot pink, lemon and orange.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\n== Notable fashion designers and houses ==\nNigerian publications such as ''Flair West Africa'' (formerly called ''True Love'' Magazine), ''Genevieve'', ''TW'' and ''Arise''; websites like Stylehousefiles.com, Bellanaija.com, Ladybrille.com, Fashionafrica.com, Shopliquorice.blogspot.com, showcase and promote Nigerian fashion.<ref name=stylehousefiles/> Nigerian fashion has created female entrepreneurs and has improved the Nigerian economy by creating jobs and opportunities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Madichie|first=Nnamdi|year=2009|title=Breaking the Glass Ceiling in Nigeria: A Review of Women's Entrepreneurship|journal=Journal of African Business|volume=10|pages=51\u201366|doi=10.1080/15228910802701361}}</ref>\n\nThe Nigerian fashion industry according to designer Maki-Oh suffers from, \"Mediocrity, electricity [problems] and quality control.\" There are no bodies regulating the fashion industry and there are no government incentives to support newcomers.  There are issues of finishing which nearly every designer suffers from as most of them rely on self-taught tailors. The result is an expensive price tag for less than perfect products.<ref name=stylehousefiles/>\n\nHelen Jennings notes, \"the success of the new generation of designers, models and fashion scenes around Africa is a reflection of Africa's success as a whole. The continent is gradually emerging as a global power thanks to increased trade and investment between Africa and the rest of the world and improved political stability and economic growth in burgeoning democracies such as Nigeria.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.randomhouse.de/leseprobe/New-African-Fashion-(US-Version)/leseprobe_9783791345796.pdf|title=New African Fashion|last=Jennings|first=Helen|date=|website=Random House|publisher=Prestel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) is the recognized body for the Fashion Designers Profession and was duly incorporated in 1989 by the then Federal Ministry of Trade and Corporate Affairs.

This empire was ruled by kings and emerged in the mid-7th century and probably ended with the [[Battle of the Boarn]] in 734 when the Frisians were defeated by the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]]. It lay mainly in what is now the Netherlands and \u2013 according to some 19th century authors \u2013 extended from the [[Zwin]] near [[Bruges]] in Belgium to the [[Weser]] in Germany. The center of power was the city of [[Utrecht]]. In medieval writings, the region is designated by the Latin term Frisia. There is a dispute among historians about the extent of this realm; There is no documentary evidence for the existence of a permanent central authority. Possibly Frisia consisted of multiple [[petty kingdom]]s, which transformed in time of war to a unit to resist invading powers, and then headed by an elected leader, the [[primus inter pares]]. It is possible that [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]] established an administrative unit. Among the Frisians at that time there was no [[Feudalism|feudal system]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=OPSxMRyYW8sC&lpg=PA386&dq=frisian%20kingdom&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q=frisian%20kingdom&f=false | title=Rondom de mondingen van Rijn & Maas: Landschap en bewoning tussen de 3e en 9e eeuw in Zuid-Holland, in het bijzonder de Oude Rijnstreek| isbn=9789088900785| last1=Dijkstra| first1=Menno| year=2011}}</ref>\n\n== Pre-Migration Period ==\nThe ancient [[Frisii]] were living in the low-lying region between the [[Zuiderzee]] and the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]].

He defeated them in several battles and so brought an end to the Frisian independence, expanding the Frankish Empire further to the east, where the [[Saxon Wars]] would begin. The Saxon leader [[Widukind]] organized resistance to the Franks, in 782 the Frisians east of the Lauwers also joined the uprising. The uprising expanded to Frisian lands in the west that had been pacified earlier. This led to an en masse return to paganism by the population, marauders burned churches and the priests had to flee south. The Carolingians conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]]. They laid Frisia under the rule of ''grewan'', a title that has been loosely related to [[count]] in its early sense of \"governor\" rather than \"[[Feudalism|feudal overlord]]\".<ref name=\"Homans1957\" />{{rp|page=205}} Charlemagne eventually crushed this revolt, but faced another uprising by the Frisians in 793 - driven by the conscription of Frisians into the Frankish army.

This again led to a temporary return to paganism, and again priests had to flee. This uprising was also suppressed by the Franks. During this time [[Charlemagne]] imposed the [[Lex Frisionum]], a penal code which stratified Frisia into Nobility, Freemen, Serfs and Slaves.\n\nIn 810 the Danish king [[Gudfred]] let a fleet consisting of 200 ships invade Frisia, and claiming the territory as a part of his [[Denmark#Viking and Middle Ages|Danish kingdom]].

This empire was ruled by kings and emerged in the mid-7th century and probably ended with the [[Battle of the Boarn]] in 734 when the Frisians were defeated by the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]]. It lay mainly in what is now the Netherlands and \u2013 according to some 19th century authors \u2013 extended from the [[Zwin]] near [[Bruges]] in Belgium to the [[Weser]] in Germany. The center of power was the city of [[Utrecht]]. In medieval writings, the region is designated by the Latin term Frisia. There is a dispute among historians about the extent of this realm; There is no documentary evidence for the existence of a permanent central authority. Possibly Frisia consisted of multiple [[petty kingdom]]s, which transformed in time of war to a unit to resist invading powers, and then headed by an elected leader, the [[primus inter pares]]. It is possible that [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]] established an administrative unit. Among the Frisians at that time there was no [[Feudalism|feudal system]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=OPSxMRyYW8sC&lpg=PA386&dq=frisian%20kingdom&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q=frisian%20kingdom&f=false | title=Rondom de mondingen van Rijn & Maas: Landschap en bewoning tussen de 3e en 9e eeuw in Zuid-Holland, in het bijzonder de Oude Rijnstreek| isbn=9789088900785| last1=Dijkstra| first1=Menno| year=2011}}</ref>\n\n== Pre-Migration Period ==\nThe ancient [[Frisii]] were living in the low-lying region between the [[Zuiderzee]] and the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]].

Outside of Cologne, held by Plectrude, an ill-prepared Charles Martel was defeated by Radbod, and forced to flee to the mountains of the [[Eifel]].

Radbod made plans to invade Francia for the second time and mobilised a large army, but before he could do this he died of an illness in 719. It is not certain who the successor of Redbad was. It is believed that there were troubles with the succession, because the Frankish opponent [[Charles Martel]] could easily invade Frisia and subjugate the land.

He defeated them in several battles and so brought an end to the Frisian independence, expanding the Frankish Empire further to the east, where the [[Saxon Wars]] would begin. The Saxon leader [[Widukind]] organized resistance to the Franks, in 782 the Frisians east of the Lauwers also joined the uprising. The uprising expanded to Frisian lands in the west that had been pacified earlier. This led to an en masse return to paganism by the population, marauders burned churches and the priests had to flee south. The Carolingians conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]]. They laid Frisia under the rule of ''grewan'', a title that has been loosely related to [[count]] in its early sense of \"governor\" rather than \"[[Feudalism|feudal overlord]]\".<ref name=\"Homans1957\" />{{rp|page=205}} Charlemagne eventually crushed this revolt, but faced another uprising by the Frisians in 793 - driven by the conscription of Frisians into the Frankish army. Under the leadership of [[duke]]s [[Unno]] and [[Eilrad]],<ref name=\"Halbertsma2000\"/>{{rp|page=310}} the uprising arose east of the [[Lauwers]] and spread to other Frisian lands. This again led to a temporary return to paganism, and again priests had to flee. This uprising was also suppressed by the Franks. During this time [[Charlemagne]] imposed the [[Lex Frisionum]], a penal code which stratified Frisia into Nobility, Freemen, Serfs and Slaves.\n\nIn 810 the Danish king [[Gudfred]] let a fleet consisting of 200 ships invade Frisia, and claiming the territory as a part of his [[Denmark#Viking and Middle Ages|Danish kingdom]]. The Danish king though was shortly after the invasion killed by one of his own men, and his fleet withdrew to Denmark before it came to any clash with regular Frankish forces.\n\nBefore 1101, sources talk about counts ruling over [[Frisia]], west of the [[Vlie]] as ''Frisian'' counts. But in this year [[Floris II, Count of Holland|count Floris II]] is mentioned as ''Florentius comes de Hollant'' (Floris, Count of Holland). Holland is probably from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|holt lant}}, literally \"wood land\", describing the district around [[Dordrecht]], the nucleus of the [[County of Holland]].<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Holland</ref> The counts generally kept to this single title until 1291, when [[Floris V, Count of Holland]] decided to call himself ''Count of Holland and Zeeland, lord of Friesland''. This title was also used after Holland was united with [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], [[Bavaria-Straubing]], and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. The titles eventually lost their importance, and the last count, [[Philip II of Spain]], only mentioned them halfway through his long list of titles.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Note: The area of 50.000&nbsp;km\u00b2 in the infobox is after the [[Battle of Cologne]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Aut|G.

Movements such as [[grunge]], the [[rave scene]] and [[hip hop]] spread around the world to young people during that decade, aided by then-new technology such as [[cable television]] and the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nA combination of factors, including the continued mass mobilization of [[capital market]]s through [[neo-liberalism]], the thawing and end of the decades-long [[Cold War]], the beginning of the widespread proliferation of [[new media]] such as the Internet from the middle of the decade onwards, increasing skepticism towards [[government]], and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power across the world and within countries.

[[Zaire]] is renamed the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n**The [[Second Congo War]] starts in 1998 in central Africa and includes 50 different cultures and 7 different nations. It continued until 2003.\n\n[[File:Gulf War Photobox.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Gulf War]].]]\n*The [[Gulf War]] \u2013 Iraq was left in severe debt after the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|1980s war with Iran]]. President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994\u20131995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]]. During the war Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of [[Chechnya]].<ref>GlobalSecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War \u2013 1999\u2013???]</ref> The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the [[First Chechen War]], in which the region gained de facto [[independence]] as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].\n*The [[Kargil War]] (1999) \u2013 In May 1999, Pakistan sent troops covertly to occupy strategic peaks in [[Kashmir]]. A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].

The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992\u20131995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].\n*[[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999) \u2013 the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups.

He remained in the cabinet as Senior Minister.\n*In July 1994, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son [[Kim Jong-il]] succeeded him, taking over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine caused a great number of deaths in the late '90s, and [[North Korea]] would gain a reputation for being a large source of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a focus of concern in the international community.\n*[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy]] in Burma wins a majority of seats in the first free elections in 30 years in 1990, yet the Burmese [[military junta]] refuses to relinquish power, beginning an ongoing peaceful struggle throughout the 1990s to the present by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule in Burma.\n*In the [[Philippines]] two Presidents were elected, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1992 and [[Joseph Estrada]] in 1998.\n*Indonesian president [[Suharto]] resigned after ruling for 32 years (1966\u20131998).\n\n====Europe====\n*The improvement in relations between the countries of [[NATO]] and the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] ended the [[Cold War]] both in Europe and other parts of the world.\n*[[German reunification]] \u2013 Germany reunified on 3 October 1990 as a result of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and after integrating the economic structure and provincial governments, focused on modernization of the former communist East. People who were brought up in a socialist culture became integrated with those living in capitalist western Germany.\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]], who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Michael Heseltine]]. This was because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], and the fact that her key allies such as [[Nigel Lawson]] and [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Less than two years later on the infamous [[Black Wednesday]] of September 1992, the [[pound sterling]] crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the [[Deutsche Mark]].\n*[[John Major]] replaces [[Margaret Thatcher]] as Prime Minister in 1990.\n*The [[Perestroika|restructuring]] of the Soviet Union destabilizes, as nationalist and separatist demagogues gain popularity. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then [[Chairmen of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets|chairman]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] of [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], resigns from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and becomes the opposition leader against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The Communist Party loses its status as the governing force of the country and is banned after a [[August Putsch|coup attempt]] by Communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counter-revolution is victorious on 25 December 1991 with the resignation of Gorbachev from presidency and the [[dissolution of the USSR]]. Yeltsin became president of the successor Russian Federation and presided over a period of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned leaving [[Vladimir Putin]] as acting president.\n*The [[European Union]] forms in 1992 under the [[Maastricht Treaty]].\n*The [[Downing Street Declaration]] 15 December 1993 by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[John Major]], and the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, [[Albert Reynolds]] at the British Prime Minister's office in [[10 Downing Street]]. It affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to [[self-determination]], and that [[Northern Ireland]] would be transferred to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the prospective of the so-called \"Irish dimension\", the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref>\nPeatling, Gary (2004).

The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement, and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]) could take part in the talks, so long as they abandoned violence.<ref>Cox & Guelke, pp. 487\u2013488</ref>\n*The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United Kingdom, and the start of political negotiations.\n*[[Tony Blair]] becomes Prime Minister in 1997 following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]].\n*The [[Belfast Agreement]] (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) is signed by U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998, declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom over [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum]] was held on 22 May 1998. There was a large majority of 'Yes'. A total of 1,738 ballots were spoiled. Turnout, at 81.1% was very high for a developed country where voting is not compulsory.<ref name=ARK01>ARK: Northern Ireland Elections, [http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fref98.htm The 1998 Referendums]</ref> Turnout in the equivalent referendum in the Republic of Ireland was average for a constitutional referendum but returned almost universal approval (94.39%).\n*The [[National Assembly for Wales]] established following the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum]] was held on 18 September 1997 in which voters approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales by a majority of 6,712 votes, or 50.3% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/analysis/rozenberg2.shtml Politics 97] by Joshua Rozenberg: BBC website.

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.]]\nAt the beginning of the decade, [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental protection]] became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s. However, dates vary, with many demographers considering those born from 1995 onward as part of [[Generation Z]], the post-Millennial generation.<ref name=\"McCrindleAU\">[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=16 June 2016 }}.

The law's author, [[Joe Biden]], and UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton (see below) become vocal advocates of action against violence against women.\n*Women reach great heights of power in the United States government. [[Hillary Clinton]], leading policy proposals, traveling abroad as a State Department representative to 82 nations, advising her husband, and being elected a [[United States Senate|Senator]] (in 2000), is the most openly empowered and politically powerful [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history; [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Janet Reno]] take two of [[United States Cabinet|the cabinet]]'s top jobs as [[United States Secretary of State]] (#1), and [[United States Attorney General]] (#4), respectively.

Popular American contemporary R&B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[Vanessa L. Williams]].\n\nThe [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for [[Tibet]] from China. [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s.

One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000.

The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down.

The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999. MMORPGs go on to become among the most popular genres in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' enters the world scene with the release of the original [[Game Boy]] ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Green]]'' games in Japan in 1996, later changed to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'' for worldwide release in 1998. It soon becomes popular in the United States, spurring the term Pok\u00e9mania and is adapted into a popular [[anime]] series and [[trading card]] game, among other media forms.\n\n''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' is released in 1996. It becomes the most popular survival-horror series in video gaming well into the next decade and inspires several films.\n\n''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' is released in September 1996, becoming an innovative platformer for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|Nintendo's '''[[Game Boy]]''' was a popular handheld game console during the 1990s.\nFile:PSX-Console-wController.png|The '''[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]''' was released in the mid-1990s and became the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling gaming console]] of its time.\nFile:Diana Maria (cropped).jpg|The game '''''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]''''', launched in 1996, became particularly popular during the decade and as a result [[Lara Croft]]'s character eventually became a cultural icon in the video game industry\nFile:Mittelgrosse_lan-party.jpg|Private '''[[LAN parties]]''' were at the peak of their popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s when broadband Internet access was unavailable or too expensive for most people\n</gallery>\n\n=== Internet ===\n* '''Prominent websites / apps launched during the decade:''' [[IMDb]] (1993), [[EBay]] (1995), [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] (1994), [[GeoCities]] (1994), [[Netscape]] (1994), [[Yahoo!]] (1995), [[AltaVista]] (1995), [[ICQ]] (1996), [[Hotmail]] (1996), [[Google]] (1998), [[Napster]] (1999)\n* The pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing internet service '''[[Napster]]''', which was first launched in the fall of 1999, was the first peer-to-peer software to become massively popular. While at the time it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as [[IRC]] and [[USENET]]), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on sharing MP3 files. Napster was eventually forced to shutdown in July 2001 to prevent further copyright violations.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Further|:Category:1990s architecture}}\n[[File:Twin Towers in all its Glory.JPG|thumb|right|120px|The [[Petronas Twin Towers]] were the world's tallest buildings when completed in 1999.]]\n*The [[Petronas Towers|Petronas Twin Towers]] became two of the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest man-made structures]] ever built after they officially opened on 31 August 1999.\n\n===Sports===\n\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|250px|thumb|Fireworks in the [[SkyDome]] after [[Joe Carter]]'s [[1993 World Series|World Series]]-winning home run, as the Canadian [[Toronto Blue Jays]] won their second straight [[World Series]] title in 1993 against the US' [[Philadelphia Phillies]].]]\n*The [[1992 Summer Olympics]] are held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].\n*[[Major League Baseball]] players went on [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] on 12 August 1994, thus ending the season and canceling the [[World Series]] for the first time in 90 years.

The series would go all seven games won by the home teams that concluded in dramatic fashion with the Minnesota Twins claiming their second World Series title.\n*American NBA basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] became a major sports and pop culture icon idolized by millions worldwide. He revolutionized sports marketing through deals with companies such as [[Gatorade]], [[Hanes]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Chicago Bulls team won six NBA titles during the decade ([[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]). He was loved outside basketball thanks to his self-portrayal in the film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with the ''[[Looney Tunes|Looney Tune]]'' characters.\n*The [[National Hockey League]] would expand from 21 to 30 teams.

The NHL also returned to Atlanta with the expansion [[Atlanta Thrashers]].\n*Two of the NHL's [[Original Six]] teams, the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]] would end long [[Stanley Cup]] championship droughts; the Rangers in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] after [[Curse of 1940|54 years]], and the Red Wings would win back to back Cups in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]] after [[1955 Stanley Cup Finals|42 years]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Mario Lemieux]] led the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], one of the original NHL expansion teams, to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]] and [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|1992]].\n*In addition to the Pittsburgh Penguins, three other NHL expansion teams went on to earn their first Stanley Cup championships: the [[New Jersey Devils]] in [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]], the Colorado Avalanche in [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals|1996]], and the Dallas Stars in [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Wayne Gretzky]] announced his retirement from the NHL in 1999. Upon his final game on 18 April, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. He played for four teams during his NHL career: the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the [[Los Angeles Kings]], the [[St. Louis Blues]], and the New York Rangers.\n*American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] won his first [[Tour de France]] in 1999, less than two years after battling [[testicular cancer]].\n*In [[professional wrestling]], the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|boom period]] of the [[WWE|WWF]] from the late 1980s continued until 1993, led by such stars as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]]. A second boom period of the decade was introduced during the [[Monday Night Wars]] between the WWF and [[WCW]] from the middle of the decade to spawn the WWF's [[Attitude Era]], home to some of the biggest names in Wrestling history such as [[The Undertaker]], who would go on to have an [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak at WrestleMania]] that would go on until [[WrestleMania XXX]] in April 2014, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and the highly popular [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] group, along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] who brought WCW major success.\n*[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won an unprecedented [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in May 1999.\n*The United States hosted the 15th staging of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1994.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]].

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s.

[[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s. The 1990s also became the most important decade for [[ska punk]]/[[reggae fusion|reggae rock]], with the success of many bands like [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[No Doubt]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Save Ferris]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Sugar Ray]].\n\nThe [[rave]] movement that emerged in the late 1980s rose. Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]. Popular artists included [[Moby]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[the Orb]], [[the Chemical Brothers]], [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Todd Terry]], [[808 State]], [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], [[the KLF]] and [[the Prodigy]].\n\nThe rise of [[industrial music]], somewhat a fusion of [[synthpop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], rose to worldwide popularity with bands like [[Godflesh]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Rammstein]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. [[Groove metal]] was born through the efforts of [[Pantera]], whose seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) was notable for going number one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, becomes popular with bands like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] selling millions of albums worldwide. [[Metallica]]'s 1991 eponymous album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' is the best-selling album of the [[Soundscan|SoundScan]] era, while [[extreme metal]] acts such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and others experienced popularity throughout the decade.\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Shania Twain]] and [[Garth Brooks]].<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country is No. 1 musical style|date=19 August 1992|newspaper=Reading Eagle|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country music reflects the time|date=27 September 1992|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google|title=Country music is making waves across the seas|date=25 November 1993|work=The Star|accessdate=26 July 2010|first=Jack|last=Hurst}}</ref> The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

Lasting for 9 seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects, and was one of the few shows ever to perform karate.\n\n1993 also saw its debut of the [[medical]]\u2013[[:wikt:mystery|mystery]] drama, ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Dick Van Dyke]], who guest-starred on an episode of its sequel, ''[[Jake and The Fatman]]'', where the show got off to a rocky start, and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancelation in 2001.\n\nMedical dramas started to come into television in the '90s. One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre paving the way for ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', and other shows airing in later years. The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down. After the successful debuts of ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Don Johnson]], lasting 6 seasons (1996\u20132001) which also dealt with escapist entertainment, rather than tackling issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-25/entertainment/ca-62314_1_miami-vice|title=With a New Beat and Attitude, the 'Vice' Man Cometh|first=HEATHER|last=McCABE|date=25 April 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nReality television began on MTV; this would grow in importance in the western world into the next decade.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: ''[[World Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[World Wrestling Federation]]'' were in a ratings battle that was dubbed the Monday Night Wars (1995\u20132001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The \"War\" ended in 2001 when ''[[WWE]]'' bought ''[[WCW]]''. In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called ''[[Survivor Series]]''. WWF won the match; putting a final end to WCW.\n\nAs an animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', debuted in December 1989, became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

One of Nickelodeon's most popular and longest running series, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', started in 1999 and became a huge success.\n\nAmerican animated children's programs went through a renaissance during the decade with studios producing many critically acclaimed shows. Specifically ''[[Warner Bros Animation]]'' shows like''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Also syndicated shows like ''[[Phantom 2040]]''.\n\nThe late 90s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted by [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in primetime on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1990s in fashion}}\n[[File:Jonathan Brandis Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Grunge]]-style flannel shirt and [[curtained hair]]]]\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1990s include:\n*[[Rachel haircut|The Rachel]], [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s hairstyle on the hit show ''[[Friends]]'', became a cultural phenomenon with millions of women copying it worldwide.\n*The [[Curtained hair|Curtained Haircut]] increased in popularity in fashion and culture among teenage boys and young men in the 1990s, mainly after it was popularized in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' by the actor [[Edward Furlong]].\n*The model 1300 [[Wonderbra]] style has a resurgence of popularity in Europe in 1992 which kicks off a multinational media sensation, the 1994 re-introduction of \"The Wonderbra\" brand, and a spike in push-up, plunge bras around the world.\n*Additional fashion trends of the 1990s include the [[Tamagotchi]], [[Inline skates|Rollerblades]], [[Pogs]] and [[Dr. Martens]] shoes.\n*Bleached Blond hair became very popular in the late '90s, as was men with short hair with the bangs \"flipped up\".\n*The 1990s also saw the return of '70s teen female fashion with long, straight hair and denim hot pants.\n*''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'' sideburns also became popular in the early and mid-1990s.\n*[[Slap bracelet]]s were a popular fad among children, pre-teens and teenagers in the early 1990s and were available in a wide variety of patterns and colors.

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999.

He revolutionized sports marketing through deals with companies such as [[Gatorade]], [[Hanes]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Chicago Bulls team won six NBA titles during the decade ([[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]).

Upon his final game on 18 April, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive.

A second boom period of the decade was introduced during the [[Monday Night Wars]] between the WWF and [[WCW]] from the middle of the decade to spawn the WWF's [[Attitude Era]], home to some of the biggest names in Wrestling history such as [[The Undertaker]], who would go on to have an [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak at WrestleMania]] that would go on until [[WrestleMania XXX]] in April 2014, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and the highly popular [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] group, along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] who brought WCW major success.\n*[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won an unprecedented [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in May 1999.\n*The United States hosted the 15th staging of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1994. To this day, it holds the record for largest attendance per game during the World Cup finals (even after the tournament's expansion to 32 teams and 64 matches). Additionally, this led to the creation of the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]].\n*In motor racing, triple [[Formula One]] World Champion [[Ayrton Senna]] is fatally injured in a crash at [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] in 1994.
