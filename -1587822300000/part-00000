Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.

Although Swaraj was unsuccessful, she remained a patron of the Reddy\u2019s and was known to visit Bellary frequently.

Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.

H. Smith]]. Branson once said, \"There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration.\" At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit [[retail price maintenance]].<ref group=note>Another example was the [[Net Book Agreement]], which limited the ability of book outlets, including discount book clubs, to offer deep discounts.</ref>\n\nBranson eventually started a record shop in [[Oxford Street]] in London. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid [[purchase tax]] of 33% and a \u00a370,000 fine.

Wind shown in <span style=\"color: red\">red</span>. <big>\u2460</big> Broad reaching on port tack. \"Prepare to jibe!\" <big>\u2461</big> Bearing away, or turning downwind, and hauling in the sail(s) to begin the jibing maneuver. \"Bearing away!\" <big>\u2462</big> Heading downwind, the wind catches the other side of the sail and it jibes, then is quickly let out to its new position. \"Jibe-ho!\" <big>\u2463</big> Steadying up on the new tack. <big>\u2464</big> Broad reaching on starboard tack.]]\n<!-- These diagrams are very unprofessional, frankly a little odd in their content and captions, and unreferenced.\n[[Image:Jibing at shifting winds.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If the wind shifts, the jibe needs to be realigned]]\n[[Image:Jibing intervals.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The intervals used in a jibe are best kept as short as possible to increase efficiency]]-->\n\nA '''jibe''' (US) or '''gybe''' (Britain) is a sailing maneuver whereby a [[Sailboat|sailing vessel]] [[points of sail#reaching|reaching]] [[downwind]] turns its [[stern]] through the wind, such that the wind direction changes from one side of the boat to the other.  For [[square-rig]]ged ships, this maneuver is called '''wearing ship'''.  \n\nIn this maneuver, the mainsail will cross the center of the boat while the [[jib]] is pulled to the other side of  the boat.  If a [[spinnaker]] is up, its pole will have to be manually moved to the other side, to remain opposite the mainsail.  In a dinghy, raising the centerboard can increase the risk of capsizing during what can be a somewhat violent maneuver, although the opposite is true of a dinghy with a flat, planing hull profile: raising the centerboard reduces heeling moment during the maneuver and so reduces the risk of capsize.\n\nThe other way to change the side of the boat that faces the wind is turning the [[bow (ship)|bow]] of the boat into, and then through, the direction of the wind. This operation is known as [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]] or coming about. Tacking more than 180\u00b0 to avoid a jibe is sometimes referred to as a 'chicken jibe'.\n\n== Use ==\nMany sailboats are significantly faster sailing on a [[broad reach]] than [[points of sail|running]] (sailing straight downwind).  Thus the increased speed of a zig-zag course of alternating broad reaches can more than make up for the extra distance it takes over a straight downwind course. Jibing is also common in racing, which often use a triangular course marked with buoys; the most direct way of rounding a buoy may be to jibe.\n\nJibing is a less common technique than [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]], since a sailboat can sail straight downwind, whereas it cannot sail directly into the wind and has to sail a zig-zag course at alternating angles into the wind.  However, a jibe can generally be completed more quickly than a tack because the boat never turns into the wind, and thus a jibing boat's sails are always powered whereas a tacking boat's [[luffing]] sails are un-powered while the bow crosses through or ''into'' the direction of the wind.\n\n'Wearing ship' is the alternative maneuver for a [[square rig]]ged ship that wishes to avoid the difficulties and hazards of [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]]. Light winds, heavy seas, worn-out gear, and poor vessel or crew performance are all reasons a ship may choose to wear instead of tack. Compared to boats with a [[fore-and-aft rig]], a square rigger can jibe without any difficulty or risk of accident.  However, since these craft cannot point close to the wind, they may find it difficult to maintain turning and forward momentum as the bow passes through the large [[Points of sail#No-go zone|No-go zone]]. If the ship loses steering way, it can be 'taken aback,' with the wind pressing on the forward surface of the sails and caught [[points of sail#in irons|in irons]]. By driving the vessel backwards through the water, this puts excessive strain on the ship's masts, spars and rigging, could break the rudder, and in severe weather could dismast the ship. In some situations it was considered quicker and safer to take a square rigged ship to [[Windward and leeward|windward]] by executing a series of jibes, turning the vessel across the wind through 270 degrees rather than the 90 degrees of a tack. This, however, would result in considerable ground lost to leeward with each jibe. Wearing has been judged to be unseamanlike except in heavy weather.<ref>{{cite book |last =Keegan |first =John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =[https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 281] |isbn =0-670-81416-4 |url-access =registration |url =https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 }}</ref>\n\nWhen running (sailing nearly directly downwind) in a sloop, one may 'jibe' only the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat. This keeps both the main and jib exposed to the wind resulting in a more efficient use of wind. Setting the mainsail and the jib on opposite sides of the boat is often referred to as running \"goose-winged\", \"gull-winged\", or \"wing-and-wing\".  When running wing-and-wing, a light [[spinnaker pole]] or whisker pole is often used to hold the clew of the foresail out to the windward side of the boat.\n\n== Dangers ==\nA jibe can be dangerous in a fore-and-aft rigged boat because the sails are always completely filled by wind during the maneuver.  As the direction of the wind crosses the boat's centerline and the [[leeward]] side of the mainsail and [[boom (sailing)|boom]] suddenly become the new windward side the load on the sail and mainsheet remain high; if uncontrolled, they can swing across the deck at high speed, striking and seriously injuring anyone standing in the path of the boom or its tackle.  An uncontrolled boom slamming to the limit of its range may also put excessive stress on the rigging, and can break the boom or standing rigging, perhaps even bringing the mast down. A jibe can also result in a sudden change in the direction of [[Heeling (sailing)|heel]], and can cause unexpected course changes due to the mainsail force changing from one side of the boat to the other.\n\n==Technique==\nA safe jibe can be aided by tensioning the [[Boom vang|boom vang (kicking strap)]] to prevent the boom from lifting. In fresh winds, sailing nearly directly downwind briefly before and after the jibe and making only small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet the boom in and force the boom across the boat by hand, holding the boom in position by locking the traveler or using a [[preventer]]. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.\n\nBecause of the inherent dangers in jibing, communication among the crew is key. Typically three commands are issued by the helmsman: \"Prepare to jibe\" (or \"ready to jibe\") warns everyone to remain clear of the boom and alerts crew to be in position to handle sheets and boom for all sails. \"Bearing away\" (similar to saying \"helm's a-lee\" during a tack) indicates the rudder is being put over. \"Jibe-ho\" accompanies the start of the boom swing across the centerline.\n\nAccidental jibes may occur when running dead downwind and the wind catches the leeward side of the sail.  When the wind direction crosses the centerline of the boat without jibing the point of sail is referred to as \"by the lee\"  When sailing \"by the lee\" the outer edge of the mainsail is facing slightly into the wind.  Rolling motion, slight changes in the boat heading or wind direction can cause an unexpected and surprising jibe, suddenly and forcefully flipping the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat.  Do not sail \"by the lee\" except for brief durations (such as to avoid an obstacle), and only when keeping all crew clear of the boom swing and the arc of the mainsheet sweep. A crew member can be used to help hold the boom in place in smaller boats. When sailing directly downwind, unintentional jibes can also occur; diligent helmsmanship is required to prevent \"by the lee\" conditions and keeping clear of the boom sweep is advised.  In larger stable boats, a preventer can help by keeping the boom held forward, preventing the boom motion of a jibe, especially in light winds. However, in high winds, the \"sheeting in action\" of a preventer can cause severe rounding up on the other tack.  Smaller boats may find that a backwinded sail is more heel inducing than allowing a jibe.  See [[broach (sailing)|broach]], [[Chinese gybe]] and [[death roll]].\n\nWhen sailing in high winds, a small boat or dinghy can [[capsize]] shortly after a jibe due to helmsman error (loss of direction control, or suddenly rounding into the wind too far) or tripping over the centerboard. It is partly for this second reason that centerboards are often lifted while sailing downwind even in non-planing hulls, the main reason being that a centreboard/keel is not needed for sailing downwind and simply adds to the drag of the hull. Raising the centreboard reduces drag and increases the boat's speed.\n\nAs with most sailing training, it is particularly important to learn this maneuver in lighter winds, and practice in increase wind and faster maneuvers gradually.\n\n== For various sailing craft ==\nThe method of jibing sailing craft differs, depending on whether they are [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and aft]], square-rigged, a [[Windsurfing|windsurfer]], or a [[Kiteboarding|kitesurfer]].\n[[File:Windsurf_-_Trasluchada_-_Jibe_-_4.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windsurf_-_Trasluchada_-_Jibe_-_4.JPG|thumb|Windsurfer jibing]]\n\n* ''Fore-and-aft rig'' \u2013 A fore-and-aft sail is set for the wind on one side for a given tack.

For [[square-rig]]ged ships, this maneuver is called '''wearing ship'''.  \n\nIn this maneuver, the mainsail will cross the center of the boat while the [[jib]] is pulled to the other side of  the boat.  If a [[spinnaker]] is up, its pole will have to be manually moved to the other side, to remain opposite the mainsail.  In a dinghy, raising the centerboard can increase the risk of capsizing during what can be a somewhat violent maneuver, although the opposite is true of a dinghy with a flat, planing hull profile: raising the centerboard reduces heeling moment during the maneuver and so reduces the risk of capsize.\n\nThe other way to change the side of the boat that faces the wind is turning the [[bow (ship)|bow]] of the boat into, and then through, the direction of the wind. This operation is known as [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]] or coming about. Tacking more than 180\u00b0 to avoid a jibe is sometimes referred to as a 'chicken jibe'.\n\n== Use ==\nMany sailboats are significantly faster sailing on a [[broad reach]] than [[points of sail|running]] (sailing straight downwind).  Thus the increased speed of a zig-zag course of alternating broad reaches can more than make up for the extra distance it takes over a straight downwind course. Jibing is also common in racing, which often use a triangular course marked with buoys; the most direct way of rounding a buoy may be to jibe.\n\nJibing is a less common technique than [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]], since a sailboat can sail straight downwind, whereas it cannot sail directly into the wind and has to sail a zig-zag course at alternating angles into the wind.
