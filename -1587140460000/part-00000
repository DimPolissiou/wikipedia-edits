[http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/water-activities/paddling/whitewater-kayaking/The-Blind-Kayaker-Erik-Weihenmayer-Grand-Canyon.html].</ref> He also coached wrestling in Phoenix.\n\n== Adventure career ==\n\n=== Seven Summits ===\nWeihenmayer\u2019s first big mountain was Denali, in 1995. In 2004, with Jeff Evans, [[Sabriye Tenberken]] and six blind Tibetan teenagers, he climbed on the north side of Everest to 21,500 feet, higher than any group of blind people have ever stood. A documentary based on the project, [[Blindsight (film)|''Blindsight'']], was released in 2006.\n\nOn May 25, 2001, Weihenmayer became the first blind person to reach the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. For this feat, he was honored with a ''[[Time Magazine]]'' cover story. Of his Everest ascent, ''Time'' stated, \"There is no way to put what Erik has done in perspective because no one has ever done anything like it. It is a unique achievement, one that in the truest sense pushes the limits of what man is capable of.\"\n\nHe also completed the [[Seven summits|Seven Summits]] in September 2002, joining 150 mountaineers at the time who had accomplished that feat, but as the only climber who was blind. In 2008, he also added [[Carstensz Pyramid]] in West Papua New Guinea, the tallest peak in [[Australasia]], thus completing the more respected Seventh Summit.\n\n=== Climbing ===\nErik Weihenmayer has climbed rock and ice faces around the world. These include the first blind ascent of the 3,000-foot Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, a difficult alpine climb of spectacular [[Alpamayo]] in Peru, and an ascent of a rarely-climbed 3,000-foot frozen waterfall in Nepal. He also climbed [[Mount Everest]].\n\n=== Kayaking ===\nIn September 2014, Erik and blinded Navy veteran, Lonnie Bedwell, kayaked the entire 277-miles of the Grand Canyon, considered one of the most formidable whitewater venues in the world.\n\n=== Other Adventures ===\nIn 2006, Erik created the '''Adventure Team Challenge''', a first-of-its-kind adventure race in which teams of disabled and non-disabled athletes compete; his team won five years in a row. In 2010, he completed the Leadville 100 mountain bike race, with elevations all above 10,000 feet, on a tandem, once again becoming the first blind person to complete a world-class competition. And in 2011, Erik\u2019s Team No Limits raced across the deserts and mountains of Morocco for a month, finishing in second place on the ABC reality show [[Expedition Impossible (TV series)|''Expedition Impossible'']].\n\nHe has also completed the Primal Quest, an adventure race over 460 miles with 60,000 feet of elevation gain.\n\n== Philanthropy and No Barriers ==\nErik has made it his life\u2019s work to empower those who are marginalized and pushed to the sidelines to find purpose and fulfillment in their lives. In 2005, he co-founded No Barriers, a nonprofit organization with the tagline, \u201cWhat\u2019s within us is stronger than what\u2019s in our way.\u201d The organization helps people of diverse backgrounds and abilities develop a No Barriers Mindset - to attack challenges head on, problem solve, build winning teams, and serve others.\n\nThe signature event is the '''No Barriers Summit''', bringing together science, technology, and innovation to engage attendees to tap into the human spirit, break through personal barriers, and create community and global breakthroughs. In 2010, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their Everest climb, Erik and his team created '''Soldiers To Summits''', a program under '''No Barriers,''' to help veterans reclaim their lives by leading and serving again. On their first S2S expedition, Erik and his Everest team led ten injured soldiers to the summit of 20,000 foot [[Lobuche]] in the Himalayas. Since then, S2S has morphed into '''No Barriers Warriors''', and has carried out expeditions from the Peruvian Andes, to the volcanoes of Ecuador, to California\u2019s [[Mt. Whitney]].\n\n== Books ==\nIn addition to being a world-famous adventurer and speaker, Weihenmayer is also the author of the book, ''Touch the Top of the World: A Blind Man's Journey to Climb Farther Than the Eye can See'', which has been published in twelve countries and nine languages. ''[[Publisher\u2019s Weekly]]'' described Weihenmayer\u2019s memoir as \u201cmoving and adventure packed, Weihenmayer tells his extraordinary story with humor, honesty and vivid detail, and his fortitude and enthusiasm are deeply inspiring.\u201d The book was made into an A&E movie and released on DVD by Sony.\n\nWeihenmayer\u2019s second book, ''The Adversity Advantage: Turning Everyday Struggles Into Everyday Greatness,'' shares hard-earned lessons and practical advice for using adversity as fuel for growth and innovation. Steven Covey, author of ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'', stated, ''\u201cThis book led me to look carefully at myself with an awareness of how the challenges of my life can be the fuel that will enable me to swim against the stream, against cultural currents, against all forms of adversity inherent in my most important goals.\u201d''\n\nWeihenmayer\u2019s latest release, ''No Barriers: A Blind Man's Journey to Kayak the Grand Canyon'', was published in 2017. The book is Weihenmayer's second memoir, and chronicles his groundbreaking descent of the Grand Canyon. ''No Barriers'' is for those who dream big yet have become stuck along the way. It shines a light on the process of growth and change and illuminates the surprising ways people break into the current, where life happens. ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', a leading literary trade magazine, recently wrote: \"Weihenmayer presents an exhilarating adventure story of arduous mountain climbing and whitewater kayaking, but he also offers broader life lessons. A wonderful tribute to the greatness of the human spirit.\"\n\n== Media and Film Appearances ==\nErik\u2019s adventures have earned him dozens of awards, recognitions, and TV interviews. He's received the ESPY, Nike\u2019s Casey Martin award, and the Helen Keller Lifetime Achievement award. He's appeared on NBC\u2019s Today Show and Nightly News, Oprah, Good Morning America, Nightline, and the Tonight Show. He was featured on the cover of ''Time'', ''Outside'', and ''Climbing'' magazines. Erik has also carried torches for both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games.\n\n'''''Farther Than the Eye Can See''''', the documentary of his Everest ascent, is ranked by ''Men\u2019s Journal'' as one of the top 20 adventure films of all time. The film won first prize at 21 international film festivals and was nominated for two Emmy awards. In 2004, Erik and six Everest team members trained a group of blind Tibetan students and then lead them to 22,000 feet on the north side of Everest. '''''Blindsight''''', the documentary of the ascent, won People\u2019s Choice Awards at the Los Angeles, London, and Berlin Film Festivals, and was released in theaters in 2007 to major accolades from film critics.\n\nMost recently, Erik was featured in the award-winning film, '''''[[High Ground (film)]]''''', which was released in 2012. This powerful movie documents a team of injured veterans; led by Erik and his Everest team, as they embark on a Himalayan climbing expedition, and along the trail, struggle to heal mentally and spiritually from the devastating wounds of war.\n\nIn 2017, Weihenmayer was named one of \"The 25 Most Adventurous Men of the Past 25 Years\" by ''[[Men's Journal]]''.\n\n== Speaking ==\nWeihenmayer is one of the most sought after motivational speakers in the world, having addressed some of the world's leading companies, including [[Allstate]], Proofpoint, Apple, [[Wells Fargo]], Prudential, Google, Microsoft, [[Pepsi-Co]], [[AT&T]], and more.\n\nWeihenmayer's corporate message focuses on the topics of adversity and living a \"No Barriers Life,\" weaving narrative and inspiration together to deliver a compelling message. His talks resonate with everyone from graduating college students, to large sales teams, and the top management of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nWeihenmayer\u2019s speaking career has taken him around the globe, from the 2005 [[APEC Summit]] in Chile to the 2009 Presidential Inaugural celebration in Washington DC. In the past decade, he has delivered his message to major companies in London, Dublin, Moscow, Berlin, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Abu Dhabi as well as across the United States. He has shared speaking platforms with luminaries such as Secretary [[Colin Powell]], Vice President [[Al Gore]], and Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Weihenmayer, Erik, ''Touch the Top of the World: A Blind Man's Journey to Climb Farther Than the Eye can See'', Plume, 2002, {{ISBN|0-452-28294-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-452-28294-0}}\n* Weihenmayer, Erik & Stoltz, Paul, ''The Adversity Advantage: Turning Everyday Struggles into Everyday Greatness'', Touchstone, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7432-9022-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-9022-7}}\n* Weihenmayer, Erik, ''No Barriers: A Blind Man's Journey to Kayak the Grand Canyon'', with St. Martin's Press, 2017, {{ISBN|9781250088789}}, {{ISBN|9781250088796}}\n**Weihenmayer, Erik, ''No Barriers (Young Adult Adaptation)'', with Buddy Levy, St. Martin's Press, 2019, {{ISBN|9781250206770}}\n* Receives Honorary Doctorate Degree on 16 May 2009 from the FW [[Olin School of Business]] at the Babson College MA\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Mount Everest records]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.touchthetop.com Erik's Official Website]\n* [http://7summits.com/info/stats2/index2.php?_=d&familyname=Weihenmayer Erik's statistics and climbing biography on 7ummits.com]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weihenmayer, Erik}}\n[[Category:1968 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Blind people from the United States]]\n[[Category:Summiters of the Seven Summits]]\n[[Category:American mountain climbers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2015}}\n{{BLP sources|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Erik Weihenmayer\n| image              = Erik in Colorado.jpg\n| alt                = Weihenmayer  on Mt.

Until 2006, it was known as ''CIOE - Centro de Instru\u00e7\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais'' (Special Operations Instruction Centre).\n\nThe CTOE contains an operational unit called DOE, its Special Operations Detachment, popularly known as Rangers, tasked with performing missions similar to the [[Delta Force|US Army's Delta Force]] or British [[Special Air Service]]. Some of these missions include conducting Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrols (LRRP), [[Raid (military)|raids]] against high-value targets, locating enemy command and control centres, targeting and destruction of enemy air defences and radar systems, and [[Prisoner of war|POW]] rescue operations. The unit can be infiltrated by parachute, helicopter, small boat, or by foot.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe CTOE, heir of the historical traditions of ''Regimento de Infantaria 9'' (9th Infantry Regiment), was created on 16 April 1960 to form units specialised in counter-guerrilla operations, psychological operations, and mountaineering. These special, [[light-infantry]] units were called ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' (Special Hunters; the regular army light-infantry units were just called Hunters) and were the first units in the Portuguese Army to wear a [[beret]] (brown) and [[Disruptive Pattern Material|camouflage]]. They were elite units, with highly motivated, hand-picked personnel, whose instructors had taken courses on counter-insurgency and counter-guerrilla operations in [[France]], [[Algeria]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Spain]]. When the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] began in 1961, there were already four [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of Special Hunters in [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]]. Early in the fighting, the ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' received updated 7,62&nbsp;mm NATO small arms such as the Espingarda m/961 ([[Heckler & Koch G3]]) and the FN/German G1 [[FN FAL|FAL]] rifle (known as the m/962); the FAL was a favored weapon of the ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' due to its lighter weight and better practical accuracy compared to the m/961 G3. The 4th Company Ca\u00e7adores Especiais in particular was a very active one (their website contains lots of photos and detailed mission chronology, [http://www.4cce.org/]). Still, by the end of 1961, the Special Hunters had been disbanded: some of their training was incorporated into the instruction of the regular army Hunter companies, and the brown beret and camouflage spread to the whole Army. The CTOE remained, now tasked with giving their courses to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[NCOs]], and to form [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commando troops]].\n\n[[File:Ig-conv-sta-cruz.jpg|thumb|Infantry Regiment 9, headquartes of the Special Operations Troops Center - Old Santa Cruz Convent, Lamego, Portugal]]\n\nAfter the creation of the special operations unit in 1981, the CTOE ceased to be just an instruction facility but also served as the HQ for the new Portuguese special operations unit. The unit members wear a grass green beret and are the heir of the Special Hunters: the beret badge includes a trumpet \u2014 a symbol of the Special Hunters; and the unit is known as Rangers because the first instructors of the Special Hunters completed the [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] Course and adapted the characteristics of that training to the Special Operations Course. The unit has operated in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[East-Timor]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].\n\n== Rangers Commandments ==\n*1st - The '''RANGER''' is self-disciplined and of willing obedience;\n*2nd - The '''RANGER''' resists hunger, thirst, tiredness and discomfort;\n*3rd - The '''RANGER''' is always ready because his reason demands it and his preparation allows it;\n*4th - The '''RANGER''' consciously ponders all his decisions and never turns his back towards danger;\n*5th - The '''RANGER''' has confidence in leaders, respects them and makes himself loved by his subordinates;\n*6th - The '''RANGER''' is generous in victory and patient in adversity;\n*7th - The '''RANGER''' regulates its procedure according to the dictates of honor and duty;\n*8th - The '''RANGER''' is proud of the dignity of his mission devoted to it with enthusiasm and dedication;\n*9th - The '''RANGER''' is loyal and has in patriotism the noblest of his virtues;\n*10th - The '''RANGER''' constantly overcomes himself for firm will and indomitable value.\n\n== CTOE Courses ==\nThe CTOE has several courses:\n\n* ''COE - Curso de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais'' (Special Operations Course): [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] (reconnaissance, raids, hostage and POW rescues) and indirect action ([[insurgency]] and [[guerrilla]], [[counter-insurgency]] and counter-guerrilla, military aid) - 21 weeks.\n* [[Sniper]] Course (requires previous COE): 14 weeks.\n* Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Course (requires previous COE): [[reconnaissance]] and direct action special operations (8 weeks).\n* Irregular Operations Course (only for officers and NCOs of the permanent cadre): organisation, instruction, and orientation of irregular forces with of the objective of defending the national territory ([[Portugal]]) when invaded and start the [[resistance movement|resistance]] (4 weeks).\n* [[Psychological Operations]] Course.\n* Mountaineering Course.\n* Terrorist Threats' Prevention and Combat Course.\n\n[[File:Rangers on parade.jpg|thumb|Rangers on parade]]\n[[File:Mountain warfare.jpg|thumb|Mountain warfare]]\n[[File:Anti-terrorism.jpg|thumb|Anti-terrorism]]\n[[File:Unconventional warfare.jpg|thumb|Unconventional warfare]]\n[[File:Incursion by boat.jpg|thumb|Incursion by boat]]\n[[File:Jungle warfare.jpg|thumb|Jungle warfare]]\n[[File:The traditional green beret.jpg|thumb|The traditional green beret]]\n[[File:Completion of Special Operations Course.jpg|thumb|Completion of Special Operations Course.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one (typically no more than four) prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one (typically no more than four) prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

He quickly became a [[wikt:Pioneer|pioneer]] of industrial food production, aiming to improve the nutritional intake of worker families. Maggi was the first to bring protein-rich [[legume]] meals to the market, and followed up with a ready-made soup based on legume meals in 1886. After that Julius Maggi introduced bouillon concentrates, first in capsules, then in cubes. In 1897, Julius Maggi founded the company Maggi GmbH in [[Singen]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|title =History of Maggi|url = https://www.maggime.com/en/about-us|website = www.nestle.com|access-date = 2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, following several changes in ownership and corporate structure, Maggi's holding company merged with the Nestl\u00e9 company to form [[Nestl\u00e9 S.A.|Nestl\u00e9-Alimentana S.A.]], currently known in its [[francophone]] home base as Nestl\u00e9 S.A.<ref>{{cite web|title = FOOD HISTORY: History of Maggi brand of Nestl\u00e9|url = http://www.world-foodhistory.com/2014/03/history-of-maggi-brand-of-nestle.html|website = www.world-foodhistory.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220\">\nImage:Maggiw\u00fcrze-alt.jpg|Maggi Seasoning sauce (replica of a historic bottle)\nImage:Maggiw\u00fcrze-neu.jpg|A bottle of Maggi sauce in 2006\nImage:Br\u00fchw\u00fcrfel-1.jpg|Bouillon cubes\n</gallery>\n\n===Cube===\nThe [[bouillon cube]] or ''Maggi cube'' is a meat substitute product that was introduced in 1908.\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Cameroon]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[B\u00e9nin]], [[Gambia]], [[Senegal|S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]], [[Guinea]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Mauritania]] and parts of the [[Middle East]], Maggi cubes are an integral part of the local cuisine.
