{"title_page": "Business Plot", "text_new": "{{short description|Political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States}}\nThe '''Business Plot ''' was a [[Conspiracy (political)|political conspiracy]] in 1933 in the United States.  Retired [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Smedley Butler]] revealed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a [[Fascism|fascist]] veterans' organization with Butler as its leader and use it in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to overthrow President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1934, Butler testified before the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[House Un-American Activities Committee#Special Committee on Un-American Activities (1934-1937)|Special Committee on Un-American Activities]] (the \"[[John William McCormack|McCormack]]\u2013[[Samuel Dickstein (congressman)|Dickstein]] Committee\") on these revelations.<ref name=\"Schlesinger, p. 85\">Schlesinger, p. 85</ref> No one was prosecuted.\n\nAt the time of the incidents, news media dismissed the plot, with a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' editorial characterizing it as a \"gigantic hoax\".<ref name=\"nyt112234\"/>  While historians have not accepted the notion of a plot, they agree that Butler described one.<ref name=burk/><ref name=schmidt226/><ref name=Fox>{{cite book|last1=Fox|title=The Clarks of Cooperstown|publisher=Knopf|year=2007|isbn=978-0-307-26347-6|url=https://archive.org/details/clarksofcooperst00webe}}</ref><ref name=\"schlesinger83\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Butler and the veterans===\n[[Image:evictbonusarmy.jpg|thumb|260px|Shacks, erected by the [[Bonus Army]] on the [[Anacostia]] flats, burning after being set on fire by the US military (1932)]]\n{{Main|Bonus Army}}\n\nOn July 17, 1932, thousands of [[World War I]] veterans converged on [[Washington, D.C.]], set up tent camps, and demanded immediate payment of bonuses due to them according to the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924 (the original act made the bonuses initially due no earlier than 1925 and no later than 1945). [[Walter W. Waters]], a former Army [[sergeant]], led this \"[[Bonus Army]]\". The Bonus Army was encouraged by an appearance from retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. [[Smedley Butler]]; as a popular military figure of the time. A few days after Butler's arrival, President [[Herbert Hoover]] ordered the marchers removed and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[cavalry]] troops under the command of Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]] destroyed their camps.\n\nButler, although a self-described [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], responded by supporting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 US presidential election]].<ref name=\"support\">Schmidt, p. 219 <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\"Declaring himself a \"Hoover-for-Ex-President [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]],\" Smedley used the bonus issue and the army's use of gas in routing the \"Bonus Expeditionary Force\"--recalling infamous gas warfare during the Great War--to disparage Hoover during the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 general elections]]. He came out for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] \"despite the fact that my family for generations has been Republican,\" and shared the platform when Republican [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[George W. Norris]] opened a coast-to-coast stump for FDR in Philadelphia....Butler was pleased with the election results that saw Hoover defeated; although he admitted that he had exerted himself in the campaign more \"to get rid of Hoover than to put in Roosevelt,\" and to \"square a debt.\" FDR, his old [[Haiti]] ally, was a \"nice fellow\" and might make a good president, but Smedley did not expect much influence in the new administration.\"</span>\n</ref> By 1933 Butler started denouncing [[capitalism]] and bankers, going on to explain that for 33 years he had been a \"high-class muscle man\" for Wall Street, the bankers and big business, labeling himself as a \"racketeer for Capitalism.\"<ref>Smedley D. Butler, ''[[War is a Racket]]'' (Los Angeles: Feral House, 1935, 2003), 26</ref>\n\n===Reaction to Roosevelt===\nRoosevelt's election was upsetting for many conservative businessmen of the time, as his \"campaign promise that the government would provide jobs for all the unemployed had the perverse effect of creating a new wave of unemployment by businessmen frightened by fears of socialism and reckless government spending.\"<ref name=\"power\">{{cite book|title=The Power of Gold: the history of an obsession|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofgoldhisto00bern|url-access=registration|author=Peter L.

They viewed a currency not solidly backed by gold as [[inflation]]ary, undermining both private and business fortunes and leading to national bankruptcy. Roosevelt was damned as a socialist or Communist out to destroy private enterprise by sapping the gold backing of wealth in order to subsidize the poor.\"<ref name=\"Jules\"/>\n\n==McCormack\u2013Dickstein Committee==\nThe Committee began examining evidence on November 20, 1934. On November 24 the committee released a statement detailing the testimony it had heard about the plot and its preliminary findings. On February 15, 1935, the committee submitted its final report to the House of Representatives.<ref name=\"plotx\" />\n\nDuring the McCormack\u2013Dickstein Committee hearings Butler testified that [[Business Plot#1933|Gerald C. MacGuire]] attempted to recruit him to lead a coup, promising him an army of 500,000 men for a march on [[Washington, DC]], and financial backing. Butler testified that the pretext for the coup would be that the president's health was failing.<ref name=\"archerquote\">Archer, p. 155.</ref> Despite Butler's support for Roosevelt in the election<ref name=\"support\" /> and his reputation as a strong critic of capitalism,<ref>Schmidt, p. 231</ref> Butler said the plotters felt his good reputation and popularity were vital in attracting support amongst the general public and saw him as easier to manipulate than others. Given a successful coup, Butler said that the plan was for him to have held near-absolute power in the newly created position of \"Secretary of General Affairs\", while Roosevelt would have assumed a [[figurehead]] role. \n\nThose implicated in the plot by Butler all denied any involvement. MacGuire was the only figure identified by Butler who testified before the committee. Others Butler accused were not called to appear to testify because the \"committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men ... The committee will not take cognizance of names brought into testimony which constitute mere hearsay.\"<ref name=page1>Public Statement on Preliminary findings of HUAC, November 24, 1934, page 1</ref>\n\nOn the final day of the committee,<ref>Archer, p. 189</ref> January 29, 1935, [[John L. Spivak]] published the first of two articles in the [[Communist Party USA|communist]] magazine ''[[New Masses]]'', revealing portions of the Congressional committee testimony that had been redacted as hearsay. Spivak argued that the plot was part of a plan by [[J.P. Morgan, Jr.|J.P. Morgan]] and other financiers who were coordinating with fascist groups to overthrow President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHans Schmidt concludes that while Spivak made a cogent argument for taking the suppressed testimony seriously, he embellished his article with his \"overblown\" claims regarding Jewish financiers, which Schmidt dismisses as [[guilt by association]] not supported by the evidence of the Butler-MacGuire conversations themselves.<ref name=\"plotx\">Archer, p. x ''(Foreword)''</ref><ref name=Schmidt229>Schmidt, p. 229</ref>\n\nOn March 25, 1935, MacGuire died in a hospital in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], at the age of 37. His attending doctor at the hospital attributed the death to [[pneumonia]] and its complications, but also said that the accusations against MacGuire had led to his weakened condition and collapse which in turn led to the pneumonia.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1935/03/26/archives/gc-mguire-dies-accused-of-plot-was-named-as-leading-wall-st-move-to.html G.C.

A few days after Butler's arrival, President [[Herbert Hoover]] ordered the marchers removed and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[cavalry]] troops under the command of Gen.

Butler testified that the pretext for the coup would be that the president's health was failing.<ref name=\"archerquote\">Archer, p. 155.</ref> Despite Butler's support for Roosevelt in the election<ref name=\"support\" /> and his reputation as a strong critic of capitalism,<ref>Schmidt, p. 231</ref> Butler said the plotters felt his good reputation and popularity were vital in attracting support amongst the general public and saw him as easier to manipulate than others. Given a successful coup, Butler said that the plan was for him to have held near-absolute power in the newly created position of \"Secretary of General Affairs\", while Roosevelt would have assumed a [[figurehead]] role. \n\nThose implicated in the plot by Butler all denied any involvement. MacGuire was the only figure identified by Butler who testified before the committee.

Spivak argued that the plot was part of a plan by [[J.P. Morgan, Jr.|J.P. Morgan]] and other financiers who were coordinating with fascist groups to overthrow President [[Franklin D.

Gen. Smedley D. Butler and such others as might have knowledge germane to the issue. ...</blockquote>\n\nThe Congressional committee final report said:\n\n<blockquote>In the last few weeks of the committee's official life it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country. No evidence was presented and this committee had none to show a connection between this effort and any fascist activity of any European country. There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.\n<br>This committee received evidence from Maj. Gen Smedley D. Butler (retired), twice decorated by the Congress of the United States. He testified before the committee as to conversations with one Gerald C. MacGuire in which the latter is alleged to have suggested the formation of a fascist army under the leadership of General Butler.\n<br>MacGuire denied these allegations under oath, but your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark, of New York City, while MacGuire was abroad studying the various forms of veterans organizations of Fascist character.<ref>74th Congress House of Representatives Report, pursuant to House Resolution No. 198, 73d Congress, February 15, 1935.

A guy named Felix enters the party. Another group of friends is to be seen where Chris, a spoilt brat with his girlfriend, Gemma, and Paul with his girlfriend, Eleanor.\n\nIt seemed Felix was deeply in love with Gemma and he was stalking her just like the other day, catching Luke's attention. Luke then convinced him to go and talk to her although knowing of the upcoming consequences. Felix asks her out but she denies. He was hurt. Paul passed out so Eleanor decided to play truth or dare with all the people present.\n\nWhen it was Felix's turn, he chooses truth, and Eleanor asks him to pick anyone he'd like to fulfill his fantasy with. He chooses Gemma. Chris punches him thus he becomes hurt. Gemma dumps Chris and runs to consolidate Felix.\n\nIn the present day, after college lets out, all five of them get an invitation to visit Felix to surprise him on his birthday. They all reach the place and reunite. In front of a big mansion, they try to find a way in but soon are interrupted by a strange old man who tells them the correct address. They walk through the woods to reach a small farmhouse where they're welcomed by a mysterious, handsome man named Justin, the elder brother of Felix.\n\nThey all start settling down for a party when Justin starts the game of truth or dare to accelerate the fun. While playing the game Justin begins asking them questions from that night and reveals to everyone that he lied about Felix's suicide. When they try to stop him he shoots Chris and ties up everyone except Luke whom he convinces to be his partner throughout the night. He tortures them using truth or dare as a means to reveal who hurt his brother including the force feeding of a random choice of similar looking vats of battery acid or water. However, this is soon interrupted by an intruder whom he kills with the help of Luke.\n\nIn the meantime, Gemma escapes and Justin goes out to find her. She reaches the mansion for help but is terrified to see Felix alive but paralyzed. Felix's caretaker attempts to wrestle the gun away from her, where he is fatally wounded. Later on, Justin arrives and kills her in front of his brother. Luke is persuaded by Eleanor and Paul to free them up, but as he denies Eleanor manages to free herself by biting Luke's little finger off and impaling the back of his head on a tool lying on the floor. When Justin comes back with Felix, he is attacked by Eleanor awakes tied to a post by Eleanor.

A guy named Felix enters the party. Another group of friends is to be seen where Chris, a spoilt brat with his girlfriend, Gemma, and Paul with his girlfriend, Eleanor.\n\nIt seemed Felix was deeply in love with Gemma and he was stalking her just like the other day, catching Luke's attention. Luke then convinced him to go and talk to her although knowing of the upcoming consequences. Felix asks her out but she denies. He was hurt. Paul passed out so Eleanor decided to play truth or dare with all the people present.\n\nWhen it was Felix's turn, he choses truth, and Eleanor asks him to pick anyone he'd like to fulfill his fantasy with. He choses Gemma. Chris punches him thus he becomes hurt. Gemma dumps Chris and runs to consolidate Felix.\n\nIn the present day, after college lets out, all five of them get an invitation to visit Felix to surprise him on his birthday. They all reach the place and reunite. In front of a big mansion, they try to find a way in but soon are interrupted by a strange old man who tells them the correct address. They walk through the woods to reach a small farmhouse where they're welcomed by a mysterious, handsome man named Justin, the elder brother of Felix.\n\nThey all start settling down for a party when Justin starts the game of truth or dare to accelerate the fun. While playing the game Justin begins asking them questions from that night and reveals to everyone that he lied about Felix's suicide. When they try to stop him he shoots Chris and ties up everyone except Luke whom he convinces to be his partner throughout the night. He tortures them using truth or dare as a means to reveal who hurt his brother including the force feeding of a random choice of similar looking vats of battery acid or water. However, this is soon interrupted by an intruder whom he kills with the help of Luke.\n\nIn the mean time, Gemma escapes and Justin goes out to find her. She reaches the mansion for help but is terrified to see Felix alive but paralyzed. Felix's caretaker attempts to wrestle the gun away from her, where he is fatally wounded. Later on, Justin arrives and kills her in front of his brother. Luke is persuaded by Eleanor and Paul to free them up, but as he denies Eleanor manages to free herself by biting Luke's little finger off and impaling the back of his head on a tool lying on the floor. When Justin comes back with Felix, he is attacked by Eleanor awakes tied to a post by Eleanor. She tells them that actually on that night she made Felix perform oral sex with Paul, who was already passed out. He attempts to die by suicide out of fear of his brother, Justin. She then gives Felix a grenade and escapes with Paul, while the house gets blown up, killing both the brothers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Oakes]] as Justin\n* Tom Kane as Fenix\n* [[Liam Boyle (actor)|Liam Boyle]] as Paul\n* [[Jack Gordon (actor)|Jack Gordon]] as Chris\n* Florence Hall as Gemma\n* [[Jennie Jacques]] as Eleanor\n* [[Alexander Vlahos]] as Luke\n* [[Jason Maza]] as Jonesy\n* [[David Sterne]] as Woodbridge\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[American Film Market]] on 3 November 2011.<ref name=\"truthordare2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.28dayslateranalysis.com/2011/10/truth-or-dare-turns-to-pain-and-revenge.html|title=Truth or Dare Turns to Pain and Revenge at the AFM: Preview|last=Allen|first=Michael|date=22 October 2011|work=28 Days Later Analysis|access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> \n\n===Home media===\n''Truth or Dare'' was released [[straight-to-video]] on 27 August 2012 in the United Kingdom<ref name=\"truthordare1\">{{cite web|url=http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2012/08/truth-or-dare-new-photos-arrives-on-blu-ray-dvd-itunes-august-27-in-uk/|title=TRUTH OR DARE New Photos \u2013 Arrives On Blu-ray, DVD & iTunes August 27 In UK|date=9 August 2012|work=We Are Movie Geeks|access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> and 9 October in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/728862-watch-four-clips-for-the-thriller-truth-or-die-aka-truth-or-dare#kG4yXjRqgQVyOxOV.99|title=Watch Four Clips for the Thriller Truth or Die (aka Truth or Dare)|last=Turek|first=Ryan|date=20 August 2012|work=[[CraveOnline#Owned or associated websites|Coming Soon]]|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nDave Aldridge of ''[[Radio Times]]'' stated in his negative review: \"''Truth or Dare'' is slickly made and decently acted.

The film is a sequel to Arcand's 1986 film ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', continuing the story of the character R\u00e9my, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.\n\nThe sequel was a result of Arcand's longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in [[Montreal]], also employing a former hospital and property near [[Lake Memphremagog]].\n\nThe film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand's biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], at the [[76th Academy Awards]] in 2004. It won awards at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], six [[24th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and three [[29th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. ''The Barbarian Invasions'' was followed by the thematically related ''[[Days of Darkness (2007 Canadian film)|Days of Darkness]]'' in 2007 and ''[[The Fall of the American Empire]]'' in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen years after the events of ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', S\u00e9bastien is enjoying a successful career in quantitative finance in [[London]] when he receives a call from his mother, Louise, that his father and Louise's ex-husband R\u00e9my is terminally ill with cancer. S\u00e9bastien is not enthused about seeing R\u00e9my, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many [[adultery|adulteries]]. R\u00e9my and his friends of the older generation are still largely [[social democracy|social-democrats]] and proponents of [[Quebec nationalism]], positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. R\u00e9my does not like S\u00e9bastien's career, lack of reading or fondness for video games.\n\nThe father and son travel to the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]] to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. S\u00e9bastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls R\u00e9my's old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing [[heroin]] is \"800%\" more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for R\u00e9my from a drug addict, Nathalie.\n\nMeanwhile, R\u00e9my is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie's mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while R\u00e9my, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the [[September 11 attacks]] as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].  After R\u00e9my and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving [[-ism]]s. R\u00e9my dies in the company of his friends and S\u00e9bastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom R\u00e9my calls his guardian angel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as R\u00e9my\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rousseau]] as S\u00e9bastien\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Berryman]] as Louise\n* [[Louise Portal]] as Diane\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Nathalie\n* [[Marina Hands]] as Ga\u00eblle\n* [[Dominique Michel]] as Dominique\n* [[Pierre Curzi]] as Pierre\n* [[Yves Jacques]] as Claude\n* [[Isabelle Blais]] as Sylvaine\n* Toni Cecchinato as Alessandro\n* [[Sophie Lorain]] as First Lover\n* [[Mitsou|Mitsou G\u00e9linas]] as Ghislaine\n* [[Micheline Lanct\u00f4t]] as Nurse Carole\n* [[Johanne-Marie Tremblay]] as Sister Constance\n* [[Roy Dupuis]] as Narcotics Officer Gilles Levac\n* [[Lise Roy]] as Mme.

written and directed by [[Denys Arcand]] and starring [[R\u00e9my Girard]], [[St\u00e9phane Rousseau]] and [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]]. The film is a sequel to Arcand's 1986 film ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', continuing the story of the character R\u00e9my, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.\n\nThe sequel was a result of Arcand's longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in [[Montreal]], also employing a former hospital and property near [[Lake Memphremagog]].\n\nThe film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand's biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], at the [[76th Academy Awards]] in 2004. It won awards at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], six [[24th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and three [[29th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. ''The Barbarian Invasions'' was followed by the thematically related ''[[Days of Darkness (2007 Canadian film)|Days of Darkness]]'' in 2007 and ''[[The Fall of the American Empire]]'' in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen years after the events of ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', S\u00e9bastien is enjoying a successful career in quantitative finance in [[London]] when he receives a call from his mother, Louise, that his father and Louise's ex-husband R\u00e9my is terminally ill with cancer. S\u00e9bastien is not enthused about seeing R\u00e9my, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many [[adultery|adulteries]]. R\u00e9my and his friends of the older generation are still largely [[social democracy|social-democrats]] and proponents of [[Quebec nationalism]], positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. R\u00e9my does not like S\u00e9bastien's career, lack of reading or fondness for video games.\n\nThe father and son travel to the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]] to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. S\u00e9bastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls R\u00e9my's old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing [[heroin]] is \"800%\" more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for R\u00e9my from a drug addict, Nathalie.\n\nMeanwhile, R\u00e9my is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie's mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while R\u00e9my, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the [[September 11 attacks]] as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].  After R\u00e9my and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving [[-ism]]s. R\u00e9my dies in the company of his friends and S\u00e9bastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom R\u00e9my calls his guardian angel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as R\u00e9my\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rousseau]] as S\u00e9bastien\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Berryman]] as Louise\n* [[Louise Portal]] as Diane\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Nathalie\n* [[Marina Hands]] as Ga\u00eblle\n* [[Dominique Michel]] as Dominique\n* [[Pierre Curzi]] as Pierre\n* [[Yves Jacques]] as Claude\n* [[Isabelle Blais]] as Sylvaine\n* Toni Cecchinato as Alessandro\n* [[Sophie Lorain]] as First Lover\n* [[Mitsou|Mitsou G\u00e9linas]] as Ghislaine\n* [[Micheline Lanct\u00f4t]] as Nurse Carole\n* [[Johanne-Marie Tremblay]] as Sister Constance\n* [[Roy Dupuis]] as Narcotics Officer Gilles Levac\n* [[Lise Roy]] as Mme.

From 1953 onwards, the Communist Party of China began to implement collective ownership of expropriated land through the creation of \"Agricultural Production Cooperatives\" transferring property rights from the former landlord class to the Chinese state.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nIn the mid-19th century, the [[Taiping Rebellion]] had a short-lived program of [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom#Policies|land confiscation and redistribution]] and after\nthe [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the founder of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]], [[Sun Yat-sen]], advocated a \"[[Land reform|land to the tiller]]\" program of [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang#History|equal distribution of land]] which was partly implemented by the Nationalist Government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nAs early as 1927, [[Mao Zedong]] believed that the countryside would be the basis of revolution. Land reform was key for the [[Communist Party of China]] both to carry out its program of social equality and to extend its control to the countryside. Unlike in Russia before the revolution, peasants in imperial China were not in feudal bondage to large estates; they either owned their land or rented it. They marketed their crops for cash in village markets, but [[Chinese gentry|local elites]] used their connections with officialdom to dominate local society. When the central government began to lose control in the late 19th century and then disintegrated after 1911, the local gentry and clan organizations became even more powerful. {{sfnb|M\u00fchlhahn|2019|p=402}} Mao's 1927 ''[[Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan]]'' advocated a then heretical strategy of mobilizing poor peasants to carry out \"struggle\" (''douzheng'' ). Mao from that point on rejected the idea of peaceful land reform, arguing that peasants could not achieve true liberation unless they participated in the violent overthrow of the landlords.{{sfnb|DeMare|2019|p = 10, 104-105}}\n\nOver the following decades, the Party went back and forth on strategy. Leaders fought over such questions as the level of violence which was to be used; whether to woo or target middle peasants, who farmed most of the land; or to redistribute all of the land to poor peasants.{{sfnb|DeMare|2019|pp= 6-17}} During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second United Front]], the Party emphasized Sun Yat-sen's moderate \"[[land to the tiller]]\" program, which limited rent to 37 1/2% of the crop, rather than land redistribution. At the outbreak of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1946, however, Mao began to push for a return to radical policies to mobilize the village against the Landlord class, but protected the rights of middle peasants and specified that rich peasants were not landlords.  {{sfnb|DeMare|2019|p=10-11}} The July 7 Directive of 1946 set off eighteen months of fierce conflict in which all rich peasant and landlord property of all types was to be confiscated and redistributed to poor peasants. Party work teams went quickly from village to village and divided the population into landlords, rich, middle,  poor, and landless peasants. Because the work teams did not involve villagers in the process, however, rich and middle peasants quickly returned to power. {{sfnb|Tanner|2015| pp = 134-135}} \n\nThe Outline Land Law of October 1947 increased the pressure. <ref>Saich ''The Rise to Power of the Chinese Communist Party'' [https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Rise_to_Power_of_the_Chinese_Communi/w48YDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Outline+Land+Law%22+-wikipedia&printsec=frontcover Outline Land Law of 1947] </ref> Party central sent the work teams back to the villages to put poor and landless peasants in charge, mandating the elimination of land rent, which it termed \"feudal exploitation\", and the elimination of landlord status. The work teams mobilized poor and landless peasants to take direct and violent action against the leading clans and families of neighboring villages to ensure that family loyalties not interfere with the campaign. <ref>{{cite book |last = Tanner |first =Harold Miles   |year = 2015 |title = Where Chiang Kai-Shek Lost China: The Liao-Shen Campaign, 1948 | |publisher = Indiana University Press| location = Bloomington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no4bCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn = 9780253016928 |ref = harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=no4bCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=land%20reform&f=false p.135-137]</ref> In one village in southern Hebei, a foreign observer recorded that four people were stoned to death, {{sfnb|CrookCrook|1979|p = 151}} and [[William H.

Chinese leadership insisted that the communes must produce more grain for the cities and earn foreign exchange from exports. These reforms were generally unpopular with the peasants and usually implemented by summoning them to meetings and making them stay there for days and sometimes weeks until they \"voluntarily\" agreed to join the collective.\n\n==== Great Leap Forward ====\n\nDuring the [[Great Leap Forward]], the state introduced a system of compulsory state purchases of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the [[Soviet Union]]. Together, taxation and compulsory purchases accounted for 30% of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus.<ref>Mirsky, Jonathan. \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/26/the-china-we-dont-know/ The China We Don't Know] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016120725/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/26/the-china-we-dont-know/ |date=2015-10-16 }}.\" New York Review of Books Volume 56, Number 3.

This too was done in the name of discouraging excessive consumption.\n\nDuring 1958\u20131960 China continued to be a substantial net exporter of grain, despite the widespread famine experienced in the countryside, as Mao sought to maintain face and convince the outside world of the success of his plans. Foreign aid was refused. When the Japanese foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart Chen Yi of an offer of 100,000 tonnes of wheat to be shipped out of public view, he was rebuffed. [[John F. Kennedy]] was also aware that the Chinese were exporting food to Africa and Cuba during the famine and said \"we've had no indication from the Chinese Communists that they would welcome any offer of food.\"<ref>{{cite|last= Dik\u00f6tter|first = Frank|title =Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-62|place = London| publisher = Bloomsbury| year =2010 |ref= harv}}, p. = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nuKoQeYTGRMC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=japanese+foreign+minister+told+his+Chinese+counterpart+Chen+Yi+of+an+offer+of+100,000+tonnes+of+wheat&source=bl&ots=BGb-UJXDLq&sig=ACfU3U0icQ09IwgUFMxCzlsYCPMxFAMwSQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx2d-QgdrlAhUHPq0KHcenA4QQ6AEwC3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=japanese%20foreign%20minister%20told%20his%20Chinese%20counterpart%20Chen%20Yi%20of%20an%20offer%20of%20100%2C000%20tonnes%20of%20wheat&f=false 114\u2013115].</ref> With dramatically reduced yields, even urban areas suffered much reduced rations;

From 1953 onwards, the Communist Party of China began to implement collective ownership of expropriated land through the creation of \"Agricultural Production Cooperatives\" transferring property rights from the former landlord class to the Chinese state.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nIn the mid-19th century, the [[Taiping Rebellion]] had a short-lived program of [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom#Policies|land confiscation and redistribution]] and after\nthe [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the founder of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]], [[Sun Yat-sen]], advocated a \"[[Land reform|land to the tiller]]\" program of [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang#History|equal distribution of land]] which was partly implemented by the Nationalist Government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nAs early as 1927, [[Mao Zedong]] believed that the countryside would be the basis of revolution. Land reform was key for the [[Communist Party of China]] both to carry out its program of social equality and to extend its control to the countryside. Unlike in Russia before the revolution, peasants in imperial China were not in feudal bondage to large estates; they either owned their land or rented it. They marketed their crops for cash in village markets, but [[Chinese gentry|local elites]] used their connections with officialdom to dominate local society. When the central government began to lose control in the late 19th century and then disintegrated after 1911, the local gentry and clan organizations became even more powerful. {{sfnb|M\u00fchlhahn|2019|p=402}} Mao's 1927 ''[[Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan]]'' advocated a then heretical strategy of mobilizing poor peasants to carry out \"struggle\" (''douzheng'' ). Mao from that point on rejected the idea of peaceful land reform, arguing that peasants could not achieve true liberation unless they participated in the violent overthrow of the landlords.{{sfnb|DeMare|2019|p = 10, 104-105}}\n\nOver the following decades, the Party went back and forth on strategy. Leaders fought over such questions as the level of violence which was to be used; whether to woo or target middle peasants, who farmed most of the land; or to redistribute all of the land to poor peasants.{{sfnb|DeMare|2019|pp= 6-17}} During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second United Front]], the Party emphasized Sun Yat-sen's moderate \"[[land to the tiller]]\" program, which limited rent to 37 1/2% of the crop, rather than land redistribution. At the outbreak of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1946, however, Mao began to push for a return to radical policies to mobilize the village against the Landlord class, but protected the rights of middle peasants and specified that rich peasants were not landlords.  {{sfnb|DeMare|2019|p=10-11}} The July 7 Directive of 1946 set off eighteen months of fierce conflict in which all rich peasant and landlord property of all types was to be confiscated and redistributed to poor peasants. Party work teams went quickly from village to village and divided the population into landlords, rich, middle,  poor, and landless peasants. Because the work teams did not involve villagers in the process, however, rich and middle peasants quickly returned to power. {{sfnb|Tanner|2015| pp = 134-135}} \n\nThe Outline Land Law of October 1947 increased the pressure. <ref>Saich ''The Rise to Power of the Chinese Communist Party'' [https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Rise_to_Power_of_the_Chinese_Communi/w48YDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Outline+Land+Law%22+-wikipedia&printsec=frontcover Outline Land Law of 1947] </ref> Party central sent the work teams back to the villages to put poor and landless peasants in charge, mandating the elimination of land rent, which it termed \"feudal exploitation\", and the elimination of landlord status. The work teams mobilized poor and landless peasants to take direct and violent action against the leading clans and families of neighboring villages to ensure that family loyalties not interfere with the campaign. <ref>{{cite book |last = Tanner |first =Harold Miles   |year = 2015 |title = Where Chiang Kai-Shek Lost China: The Liao-Shen Campaign, 1948 | |publisher = Indiana University Press| location = Bloomington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no4bCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn = 9780253016928 |ref = harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=no4bCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=land%20reform&f=false p.135-137]</ref> In one village in southern Hebei, a foreign observer recorded that four people were stoned to death, {{sfnb|CrookCrook|1979|p = 151}} and [[William H.

Chinese leadership insisted that the communes must produce more grain for the cities and earn foreign exchange from exports. These reforms were generally unpopular with the peasants and usually implemented by summoning them to meetings and making them stay there for days and sometimes weeks until they \"voluntarily\" agreed to join the collective.\n\n==== Great Leap Forward ====\n\nDuring the [[Great Leap Forward]], the state introduced a system of compulsory state purchases of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the [[Soviet Union]]. Together, taxation and compulsory purchases accounted for 30% of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus.<ref>Mirsky, Jonathan. \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/26/the-china-we-dont-know/ The China We Don't Know] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016120725/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/26/the-china-we-dont-know/ |date=2015-10-16 }}.\" New York Review of Books Volume 56, Number 3. February 26, 2009.</ref> Rationing was also introduced in the cities to curb 'wasteful consumption' and encourage savings (which were deposited in state-owned banks and thus became available for investment), and although food could be purchased from state-owned retailers the market price was higher than that for which it had been purchased. This too was done in the name of discouraging excessive consumption.\n\nDuring 1958\u20131960 China continued to be a substantial net exporter of grain, despite the widespread famine experienced in the countryside, as Mao sought to maintain face and convince the outside world of the success of his plans. Foreign aid was refused. When the Japanese foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart Chen Yi of an offer of 100,000 tonnes of wheat to be shipped out of public view, he was rebuffed. [[John F. Kennedy]] was also aware that the Chinese were exporting food to Africa and Cuba during the famine and said \"we've had no indication from the Chinese Communists that they would welcome any offer of food.\"<ref>{{cite|last= Dik\u00f6tter|first = Frank|title =Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-62|place = London| publisher = Bloomsbury| year =2010 |ref= harv}}, p. = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nuKoQeYTGRMC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=japanese+foreign+minister+told+his+Chinese+counterpart+Chen+Yi+of+an+offer+of+100,000+tonnes+of+wheat&source=bl&ots=BGb-UJXDLq&sig=ACfU3U0icQ09IwgUFMxCzlsYCPMxFAMwSQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx2d-QgdrlAhUHPq0KHcenA4QQ6AEwC3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=japanese%20foreign%20minister%20told%20his%20Chinese%20counterpart%20Chen%20Yi%20of%20an%20offer%20of%20100%2C000%20tonnes%20of%20wheat&f=false 114\u2013115].</ref> With dramatically reduced yields, even urban areas suffered much reduced rations;
