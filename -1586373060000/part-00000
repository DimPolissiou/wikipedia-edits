{"title_page": "Science of photography", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe '''[[science]] of [[photography]]''' refers to the use of science, such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], in all aspects of photography. This applies to the camera, its lenses, physical operation of the camera, electronic camera internals, and the process of developing [[Photographic film|film]] in order to take and develop pictures properly.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.photography.com/topics/science-of-photography/\n| title = Science of Photography\n| accessdate = 2007-05-21\n}}</ref>\n\n== Law of reciprocity ==\n{{main|Reciprocity (photography)}}\n\n:Exposure \u221d Aperture Area &times; Exposure Time &times; Scene Luminance\n\nThe law of reciprocity describes how light intensity and duration trade off to make an exposure\u2014it defines the relationship between [[shutter speed]] and [[aperture]], for a given total [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Changes to any of these elements are often measured in units known as \"stops\"; a stop is equal to a factor of two.\n\nHalving the amount light exposing the film can be achieved either by:\n# Closing the aperture by one stop\n# Decreasing the shutter time (increasing the shutter speed) by one stop\n# Cutting the scene lighting by half\nLikewise, doubling the amount of light exposing the film can be achieved by the opposite of one of these operations.\n\nThe luminance of the scene, as measured on a reflected [[light meter]], also affects the exposure proportionately. The amount of light required for proper exposure depends on the [[film speed]]; which can be varied in stops or fractions of stops. With either of these changes, the aperture or shutter speed can be adjusted by an equal number of stops to get to a suitable exposure.\n\nLight is most easily controlled through the use of the camera's aperture (measure in [[f-number|f-stops]]), but it can also be regulated by adjusting the [[shutter speed]]. Using faster or slower [[photographic film|film]] is not usually something that can be done quickly, at least using roll film. [[Large format]] cameras use individual [[sheet film|sheets of film]] and each sheet could be a different speed. Also, if you're using a larger format camera with a polaroid back, you can switch between backs containing different speed polaroids. [[Digital camera]]s can easily adjust the film speed they are simulating by adjusting the [[exposure index]], and many digital cameras can do so automatically in response to exposure measurements.\n\nFor example, starting with an exposure of 1/60 at {{f/|16}}, the depth-of-field could be made shallower by opening up the aperture to {{f/|4}}, an increase in exposure of 4 stops. To compensate, the shutter speed would need to be increased as well by 4 stops, that is, adjust exposure time down to 1/1000. Closing down the aperture limits the resolution due to the [[#Diffraction limit|diffraction limit]].\n\nThe reciprocity law specifies the total exposure, but the response of a photographic material to a constant total exposure may not remain constant for very long exposures in very faint light, such as photographing a starry sky, or very short exposures in very bright light, such as photographing the sun. This is known as ''reciprocity failure'' of the material (film, paper, or sensor).\n\n== Lenses ==\n{{main|Photographic lens}}\nA photographic lens is usually composed of several [[lens (optics)|lens elements]], which combine to reduce the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], [[Coma (optics)|coma]], [[spherical aberration]], and other [[aberration in optical systems|aberrations]]. A simple example is the three-element [[Cooke triplet]], still in use over a century after it was first designed, but many current photographic lenses are much more complex.\n\nUsing a smaller aperture can reduce most, but not all aberrations. They can also be reduced dramatically by using an [[aspheric lens|aspheric element]], but these are more complex to grind than spherical or cylindrical lenses. However, with modern manufacturing techniques the extra cost of manufacturing aspherical lenses is decreasing, and small aspherical lenses can now be made by molding, allowing their use in inexpensive consumer cameras. [[Fresnel lens]]es are not common in photography are used in some cases due to their very low weight<ref>https://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/a/ideas-and-inspiration/phase-fresnel-from-wildlife-photography-to-portraiture.html</ref>. The recently developed Fiber-coupled monocentric lens consists of spheres constructed of concentric hemispherical shells of different glasses tied to the focal plane by bundles of optical fibers.<ref>http://pietrzyk.us/ieee-spectrum-shows-off-new-lens-technology-2/</ref> Monocentric lenses are also not used in cameras because the technology was just debuted in October 2013 at the Frontiers in Optics Conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\nAll lens design is a compromise between numerous factors, not excluding cost. [[Zoom lens]]es (i.e. lenses of variable focal length) involve additional compromises and therefore normally do not match the performance of [[prime lens]]es.\n\nWhen a camera lens is focused to project an object some distance away onto the film or detector, the objects that are closer in distance, relative to the distant object, are also ''approximately'' in focus. The range of distances that are nearly in focus is called the [[depth of field]]. Depth of field generally increases with decreasing aperture diameter (increasing f-number). The unfocused blur outside the depth of field is sometimes used for artistic effect in photography. The subjective appearance of this blur is known as [[bokeh]].\n\nIf the camera lens is focused at or beyond its [[hyperfocal distance]], then the depth of field becomes large, covering everything from half the hyperfocal distance to [[infinity]]. This effect is used to make \"[[Focus free lens|focus free]]\" or fixed-focus cameras.\n\n{{see also|Circle of confusion}}\n\n== Motion blur ==\nMotion blur is caused when either the camera or the subject moves during the exposure. This causes a distinctive streaky appearance to the moving object or the entire picture (in the case of camera shake).\n\n[[File:Bl\u00e9riot XI Thulin A Mikael Carlson OTT 2013 08b.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Motion blur of a background while following the subject]]\nMotion blur can be used artistically to create the feeling of speed or motion, as with running water. An example of this is the technique of \"[[panning (camera)|panning]]\", where the camera is moved so it follows the subject, which is usually fast moving, such as a car. Done correctly, this will give an image of a clear subject, but the background will have motion blur, giving the feeling of movement. This is one of the more difficult photographic techniques to master, as the movement must be smooth, and at the correct speed. A subject that gets closer or further away from the camera may further cause focusing difficulties.\n\n[[File:Olympiastadion at dusk.JPG|thumb|Light trails]]\nLight trails are another photographic effect where motion blur is used. Photographs of the lines of light visible in long exposure photos of roads at night are one example of the effect.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.treklens.com/gallery/Africa/South_Africa/photo102894.htm\n |title=TrekLens \u2013 JoBurg Skyline and Light Trails Photo\n |work=treklens.com\n |accessdate=4 April 2010\n}}</ref> This is caused by the cars moving along the road during the exposure. The same principle is used to create star trail photographs.\n\nGenerally, motion blur is something that is to be avoided, and this can be done in several different ways. The simplest way is to limit the shutter time so that there is very little movement of the image during the time the shutter is open. At longer [[focal length]]s, the same movement of the camera body will cause more motion of the image, so a shorter shutter time is needed. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that the shutter speed in seconds should be about the reciprocal of the [[35 mm equivalent focal length]] of the lens in millimeters. For example, a 50&nbsp;mm lens should be used at a minimum speed of 1/50&nbsp;sec, and a 300&nbsp;mm lens at 1/300 of a second. This can cause difficulties when used in low light scenarios, since exposure also decreases with shutter time.\n\n[[File:Gl\u00fchlampe explodiert.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[High speed photography]] uses very short exposures to prevent blurring of fast moving subjects]]\nMotion blur due to subject movement can usually be prevented by using a faster shutter speed. The exact shutter speed will depend on the speed at which the subject is moving. For example, a very fast shutter speed will be needed to \"freeze\" the [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]] of a helicopter, whereas a slower shutter speed will be sufficient to freeze a runner.\n\nA [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]] may be used to avoid motion blur due to camera shake. This will stabilize the camera during the exposure. A tripod is recommended for exposure times more than about 1/15 seconds. There are additional techniques which, in conjunction with use of a tripod, ensure that the camera remains very still. These may employ use of a remote actuator, such as a cable release or [[infrared]] remote switch to activate the shutter, so as to avoid the movement normally caused when the shutter release button is pressed directly. The use of a \"self timer\" (a timed release mechanism that automatically trips the shutter release after an interval of time) can serve the same purpose. Most modern [[single-lens reflex camera]] (SLR) have a [[mirror lock-up]] feature that eliminates the small amount of shake produced by the mirror flipping up.\n\n== Focus ==\n[[File:Vendeuse d'arachides.jpg|thumb|This subject is in sharp focus while the distant background is unfocused]]\n[[focus (optics)|Focus]] is the tendency for light rays to reach the same place on the [[image sensor]] or film, independent of where they pass through the lens. For clear pictures, the focus is adjusted for distance, because at a different object distance the rays reach different parts of the lens with different angles. In modern photography, focusing is often accomplished automatically.\n\nThe [[autofocus]] system in modern [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLRs]] use a [[detector|sensor]] in the mirrorbox to measure contrast. The sensor's signal is analyzed by an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC), and the ASIC tries to maximize the contrast pattern by moving lens elements. The ASICs in modern cameras also have special [[algorithms]] for predicting motion, and other advanced features.\n\n== Aberration ==\n{{main|Aberration in optical systems}}\nAberrations are the blurring and distorting properties of an [[optical system]]. A high quality lens will produce a smaller amount of aberrations.\n\n[[Spherical aberration]] occurs due to the increased [[refraction]] of light rays that occurs when rays strike a lens, or a reflection of light rays that occurs when rays strike a mirror near its edge in comparison with those that strike nearer the center. This is dependent on the focal length of a spherical lens and the distance from its center. It is compensated by designing a multi-lens system or by using an [[aspheric lens]].\n\n[[Chromatic aberration]] is caused by a lens having a different [[refractive index]] for different [[wavelengths]] of [[light]] and the dependence of the optical properties on [[Color vision|color]]. Blue light will generally bend more than red light. There are higher order chromatic aberrations, such as the dependence of magnification on color. Chromatic aberration is compensated by using a lens made out of materials carefully designed to cancel out chromatic aberrations.\n\nCurved focal surface is the dependence of the first order focus on the position on the film or CCD. This can be compensated with a multiple lens optical design, but curving the film has also been used.\n\n== Film grain resolution ==\n[[File:Korn HP4 ISO1600.jpg|thumb|Strong grain on ISO1600 negative]]\n[[Black-and-white]] film has a \"shiny\" side and a \"dull\" side. The dull side is the [[emulsion]], a gelatin that suspends an array of [[silver halide]] crystals. These crystals contain silver grains that determine how sensitive the film is to light exposure, and how fine or grainy the negative the print will look. Larger grains mean faster exposure but a grainier appearance; smaller grains are finer looking but take more exposure to activate. The graininess of film is represented by its [[ISO (film)|ISO]] factor; generally a multiple of 10 or 100. Lower numbers produce finer grain but slower film, and vice versa.\n\n== Diffraction limit ==\nSince light [[Wave propagation|propagates]] as waves, the patterns it produces on the film are subject to the wave phenomenon known as [[diffraction]], which limits the image resolution to features on the order of several times the wavelength of light. Diffraction is the main effect limiting the sharpness of optical images from lenses that are stopped down to small apertures (high f-numbers), while aberrations are the limiting effect at large apertures (low f-numbers). Since diffraction cannot be eliminated, the best possible lens for a given operating condition (aperture setting) is one that produces an image whose quality is limited only by diffraction. Such a lens is said to be ''diffraction limited''.\n\nThe diffraction-limited optical spot size on the CCD or film is proportional to the [[f-number]] (about equal to the f-number times the wavelength of light, which is near 0.0005&nbsp;mm), making the overall detail in a photograph proportional to the size of the film, or CCD divided by the f-number. For a [[135 film|35 mm]] camera with {{f/|11}}, this limit corresponds to about 6,000 resolution elements across the width of the film (36&nbsp;mm / (11 * 0.0005&nbsp;mm) = 6,500.\n\nThe finite spot size caused by diffraction can also be expressed as a [[Rayleigh criterion|criterion]] for distinguishing distant objects: two distant point sources can only produce separate images on the film or sensor if their angular separation exceeds the wavelength of light divided by the width of the open aperture of the camera lens.\n\n== Contribution to noise (grain) ==\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\nLight comes in particles and the energy of a light-particle (the [[photon]]) is the frequency of the light times [[Planck's constant]]. A fundamental property of any photographic method is how it collects the light on its [[photographic plate]] or electronic detector.\n\n=== CCDs and other photodiodes ===\n[[Photodiodes]] are back-biased semiconductor diodes, in which an intrinsic layer with very few charge carriers prevents electric currents from flowing. Depending on the material, photons have enough energy to raise one [[electron]] from the upper full band to the lowest empty band. The electron and the \"hole\", or the empty space where it was, are then free to move in the electric field and carry current, which can be measured. The fraction of incident photons that produce carrier pairs depends largely on the semiconductor material.\n\n=== Photomultiplier tubes ===\n[[Photomultiplier]] tubes are vacuum [[phototube]]s that amplify light by accelerating the photoelectrons to knock more electrons free from a series of electrodes. They are among the most sensitive light detectors but are not well suited to photography.\n\n=== Aliasing ===\n[[Aliasing]] can occur in optical and chemical processing, but it is more common and easily understood in digital processing. It occurs whenever an optical or digital image is sampled or re-sampled at a rate which is too low for its resolution. Some digital cameras and scanners have [[anti-aliasing filter]]s to reduce aliasing by intentionally blurring the image to match the sampling rate. It is common for film developing equipment used to make prints of different sizes to increase the graininess of the smaller size prints by aliasing.\n\nIt is usually desirable to suppress both noises such as grain and details of the real object that are too small to be represented at the sampling rate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Astrophotography]]\n* [[Highlight headroom]]\n* [[Infrared photography]]\n* [[Ultraviolet photography]]\n* [[Underwater photography]]\n* [[Photographic processing]]\n* [[Silver bromide]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{photography subject}}\n\n[[Category:Science of photography| ]]\n[[Category:Optics|Photography, science of]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe '''[[science]] of [[photography]]''' refers to the use of science, such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], in all aspects of photography.

Photographs of the lines of light visible in long exposure photos of roads at night are one example of the effect.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.treklens.com/gallery/Africa/South_Africa/photo102894.htm\n |title=TrekLens \u2013 JoBurg Skyline and Light Trails Photo\n |work=treklens.com\n |accessdate=4 April 2010\n}}</ref> This is caused by the cars moving along the road during the exposure. The same principle is used to create star trail photographs.\n\nGenerally, motion blur is something that is to be avoided, and this can be done in several different ways. The simplest way is to limit the shutter time so that there is very little movement of the image during the time the shutter is open. At longer [[focal length]]s, the same movement of the camera body will cause more motion of the image, so a shorter shutter time is needed. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that the shutter speed in seconds should be about the reciprocal of the [[35 mm equivalent focal length]] of the lens in millimeters. For example, a 50&nbsp;mm lens should be used at a minimum speed of 1/50&nbsp;sec, and a 300&nbsp;mm lens at 1/300 of a second. This can cause difficulties when used in low light scenarios, since exposure also decreases with shutter time.\n\n[[File:Gl\u00fchlampe explodiert.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[High speed photography]] uses very short exposures to prevent blurring of fast moving subjects]]\nMotion blur due to subject movement can usually be prevented by using a faster shutter speed. The exact shutter speed will depend on the speed at which the subject is moving. For example, a very fast shutter speed will be needed to \"freeze\" the [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]] of a helicopter, whereas a slower shutter speed will be sufficient to freeze a runner.\n\nA [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]] may be used to avoid motion blur due to camera shake. This will stabilize the camera during the exposure. A tripod is recommended for exposure times more than about 1/15 seconds. There are additional techniques which, in conjunction with use of a tripod, ensure that the camera remains very still. These may employ use of a remote actuator, such as a cable release or [[infrared]] remote switch to activate the shutter, so as to avoid the movement normally caused when the shutter release button is pressed directly. The use of a \"self timer\" (a timed release mechanism that automatically trips the shutter release after an interval of time) can serve the same purpose. Most modern [[single-lens reflex camera]] (SLR) have a [[mirror lock-up]] feature that eliminates the small amount of shake produced by the mirror flipping up.\n\n== Focus ==\n[[File:Vendeuse d'arachides.jpg|thumb|This subject is in sharp focus while the distant background is unfocused]]\n[[focus (optics)|Focus]] is the tendency for light rays to reach the same place on the [[image sensor]] or film, independent of where they pass through the lens. For clear pictures, the focus is adjusted for distance, because at a different object distance the rays reach different parts of the lens with different angles. In modern photography, focusing is often accomplished automatically.\n\nThe [[autofocus]] system in modern [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLRs]] use a [[detector|sensor]] in the mirrorbox to measure contrast. The sensor's signal is analyzed by an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC), and the ASIC tries to maximize the contrast pattern by moving lens elements. The ASICs in modern cameras also have special [[algorithms]] for predicting motion, and other advanced features.\n\n== Aberration ==\n{{main|Aberration in optical systems}}\nAberrations are the blurring and distorting properties of an [[optical system]]. A high quality lens will produce a smaller amount of aberrations.\n\n[[Spherical aberration]] occurs due to the increased [[refraction]] of light rays that occurs when rays strike a lens, or a reflection of light rays that occurs when rays strike a mirror near its edge in comparison with those that strike nearer the center. This is dependent on the focal length of a spherical lens and the distance from its center. It is compensated by designing a multi-lens system or by using an [[aspheric lens]].\n\n[[Chromatic aberration]] is caused by a lens having a different [[refractive index]] for different [[wavelengths]] of [[light]] and the dependence of the optical properties on [[Color vision|color]]. Blue light will generally bend more than red light. There are higher order chromatic aberrations, such as the dependence of magnification on color. Chromatic aberration is compensated by using a lens made out of materials carefully designed to cancel out chromatic aberrations.\n\nCurved focal surface is the dependence of the first order focus on the position on the film or CCD. This can be compensated with a multiple lens optical design, but curving the film has also been used.\n\n== Film grain resolution ==\n[[File:Korn HP4 ISO1600.jpg|thumb|Strong grain on ISO1600 negative]]\n[[Black-and-white]] film has a \"shiny\" side and a \"dull\" side. The dull side is the [[emulsion]], a gelatin that suspends an array of [[silver halide]] crystals. These crystals contain silver grains that determine how sensitive the film is to light exposure, and how fine or grainy the negative the print will look. Larger grains mean faster exposure but a grainier appearance; smaller grains are finer looking but take more exposure to activate. The graininess of film is represented by its [[ISO (film)|ISO]] factor; generally a multiple of 10 or 100. Lower numbers produce finer grain but slower film, and vice versa.\n\n== Diffraction limit ==\nSince light [[Wave propagation|propagates]] as waves, the patterns it produces on the film are subject to the wave phenomenon known as [[diffraction]], which limits the image resolution to features on the order of several times the wavelength of light. Diffraction is the main effect limiting the sharpness of optical images from lenses that are stopped down to small apertures (high f-numbers), while aberrations are the limiting effect at large apertures (low f-numbers). Since diffraction cannot be eliminated, the best possible lens for a given operating condition (aperture setting) is one that produces an image whose quality is limited only by diffraction. Such a lens is said to be ''diffraction limited''.\n\nThe diffraction-limited optical spot size on the CCD or film is proportional to the [[f-number]] (about equal to the f-number times the wavelength of light, which is near 0.0005&nbsp;mm), making the overall detail in a photograph proportional to the size of the film, or CCD divided by the f-number. For a [[135 film|35 mm]] camera with {{f/|11}}, this limit corresponds to about 6,000 resolution elements across the width of the film (36&nbsp;mm / (11 * 0.0005&nbsp;mm) = 6,500.\n\nThe finite spot size caused by diffraction can also be expressed as a [[Rayleigh criterion|criterion]] for distinguishing distant objects: two distant point sources can only produce separate images on the film or sensor if their angular separation exceeds the wavelength of light divided by the width of the open aperture of the camera lens.\n\n== Contribution to noise (grain) ==\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\nLight comes in particles and the energy of a light-particle (the [[photon]]) is the frequency of the light times [[Planck's constant]]. A fundamental property of any photographic method is how it collects the light on its [[photographic plate]] or electronic detector.\n\n=== CCDs and other photodiodes ===\n[[Photodiodes]] are back-biased semiconductor diodes, in which an intrinsic layer with very few charge carriers prevents electric currents from flowing. Depending on the material, photons have enough energy to raise one [[electron]] from the upper full band to the lowest empty band. The electron and the \"hole\", or the empty space where it was, are then free to move in the electric field and carry current, which can be measured. The fraction of incident photons that produce carrier pairs depends largely on the semiconductor material.\n\n=== Photomultiplier tubes ===\n[[Photomultiplier]] tubes are vacuum [[phototube]]s that amplify light by accelerating the photoelectrons to knock more electrons free from a series of electrodes. They are among the most sensitive light detectors but are not well suited to photography.\n\n=== Aliasing ===\n[[Aliasing]] can occur in optical and chemical processing, but it is more common and easily understood in digital processing. It occurs whenever an optical or digital image is sampled or re-sampled at a rate which is too low for its resolution. Some digital cameras and scanners have [[anti-aliasing filter]]s to reduce aliasing by intentionally blurring the image to match the sampling rate. It is common for film developing equipment used to make prints of different sizes to increase the graininess of the smaller size prints by aliasing.\n\nIt is usually desirable to suppress both noises such as grain and details of the real object that are too small to be represented at the sampling rate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Astrophotography]]\n* [[Highlight headroom]]\n* [[Infrared photography]]\n* [[Ultraviolet photography]]\n* [[Underwater photography]]\n* [[Photographic processing]]\n* [[Silver bromide]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{photography subject}}\n\n[[Category:Science of photography| ]]\n[[Category:Optics|Photography, science of]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_photography"}

Pell submitted evidence that he did not live in Ballarat or in that presbytery at the time, and the counsel-assisting noted in her final submission that \"Cardinal Pell's evidence about his living arrangements and duties in 1973 and 1974 make it less likely that he was at St Patrick's presbytery late in the afternoon on a week day.\"<ref name=\"Case Study 28\" />\n\n====March 2014 appearance====\n\nIn 2014, the royal commission was told how lawyers representing Pell and the Archdiocese of Sydney incurred costs of A$1.5&nbsp;million against a victim of child sexual abuse. The lawyers, acting on the church's instructions, \"vigorously\" fought John Ellis through the courts despite warnings of his \"fragile psychological state\". The resulting [[New South Wales Court of Appeal]] ruling established the controversial \"Ellis Defence\", which confirmed that the church could not be sued as a legal entity and held liable for child sexual abuse committed by a priest in such matters.

The only order that can properly be made is that the applicant be acquitted on each charge.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/he-was-a-witness-of-truth-why-the-judges-decided-cardinal-george-pell-was-guilty \"He was a witness of truth: why the judges decided Cardinal George Pell was guilty\"], ''The Guardian'', 21 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSCA//2019/186.html \"Pell v The Queen &#91;2019&#93;\"], VSCA 186, 21 August 2019.</ref>\n\nThe court unanimously refused leave to appeal on the second and third grounds. In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\n=== Acquittal ===\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/george-pell-appeal-in-high-court-what-happens-next/11700954 |title=Here's what happens now the High Court has agreed to hear George Pell's appeal bid |date=13 November 2019 |work=ABC News |access-date=7 April 2020 |url-status=live |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13&nbsp;November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}} This decision was made \"on the papers\".

Again he negotiated inconclusively with Pichegru, but his expensive intrigues were rendered useless by Napoleon's victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] (June 1800); moreover he was accused in London of misuse of public funds, which brought him close to a nervous breakdown. He returned to London in 1801.<ref name=\"Sparrow n.d.\"/>\n\n==Ireland==\nIn 1802 Wickham was appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and named [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], a post he held until 1804, when he resigned following the execution of [[Robert Emmet]], as he felt the laws governing Ireland to be \"unjust, oppressive and unchristian\".<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/robert-emmet-between-history-and-memory/ \"Robert Emmet between history and memory\"], History Ireland website, accessed 22 March 2014.</ref> He also entered Parliament as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the Irish borough constituency of [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]]: he sat for Cashel from 1802 to 1806, and for [[Callington (UK Parliament constituency)|Callington]] in Cornwall from 1806 to 1807.\n\n==Family papers==\nThe [[Hampshire]] [[County record office|Record Office]] holds a number of Wickham's papers. The archive relates also to his grandson William Wickham, who was vice-chairman on the first County Council. The archive includes grants of full powers to Wickham in 1799 and 1801; also poll books for the election of members of parliament representing Oxford University in 1801 and 1809, a plan showing the arrangement of wine in the cellars, and papers about Wickham's success in growing fig trees, which continue to flourish at his home in [[Binsted]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=041-wickham_2&cid=0#0|title=Hampshire Record Office Wickham family [38M49/E]|publisher=The National Archives, Kew (UK)|accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref> His other property was [[Odney|Lullebrook Manor]] at [[Cookham]] in Berkshire.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Durey, Michael (2006). \"William Wickham, the Christ Church Connection and the Rise and Fall of the Security Service in Britain, 1793\u20131801\", ''The English Historical Review'' 121#492 (June 2006), pp.&nbsp;714\u2013745. \n* Durey, Michael (2006). \"When great men fall out: William Wickham's resignation as chief secretary for Ireland in January 1804.\" Parliamentary History 25.3: 334-356.\n* Sparrow, Elizabeth (n.d.).
