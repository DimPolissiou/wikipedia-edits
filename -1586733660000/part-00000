Located to the northeast of [[Atlas Mountains]], Fez is situated at the crossroad of the important cities of all regions; {{convert|206|km|abbr=on}} from [[Tangier]] to the northwest, {{convert|246|km|abbr=on}} from [[Casablanca]], {{convert|189|km|abbr=on}} from [[Rabat]] to the west, and {{convert|387|km|abbr=on}} from [[Marrakesh]] to the southwest which leads to the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] route. It is surrounded by the high grounds, and the old city is penetrated by the [[Oued Fes|River of Fez]] flowing from the west to east.\n\nFez was founded under the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid rule]] during the 8th-9th centuries C.E. It consisted of two autonomous and competing settlements. The migration of 2000 Arab families in the early 9th century gave the nascent city its Arabic character. After the downfall of the Idrisid dynasty, several empires came and went until the 11th century when the [[Almoravid]] [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] united the two settlements and rebuilt the city, which became today's [[Fes el Bali]] quarter. Under the Almoravid rule, the city gained a reputation for the religious scholarship and the mercantile activity.\n\nFez reached its zenith in the [[Marinid]]-era, regaining the status as the capital. Numerous [[madrasa]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]s and [[Gates of Fez|city gate]]s were constructed which survived up until today. These buildings are considered the hallmarks of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and [[Moroccan architecture|Moroccan architectural styles]]. Marinid sultans also founded [[Fes Jdid]] quarter, where newer palaces and gardens were established. During this time, the Jewish population of the city grew as well, with the [[Mellah of Fez|Mellah]] (Jewish quarter) attracting the Jewish migrants from other North African regions. After the overthrow of the Marinid dynasty, the city largely declined and was replaced by Marrakesh for political and cultural influence, but remained as the capital under the [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasids]] and modern Morocco until 1912.\n\nToday, the city largely consists of two old [[medina quarter]]s, Fes el Bali and Fes Jdid, and modern urban area of Ville Nouvelle constructed during the French colonial era. The medina of Fez is listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] and is believed to be one of the world's largest urban [[pedestrian zone]]s (car-free areas).<ref>Mother Nature Network, [http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-car-free-cities/the-medina-of-fes-al-bali-morocco-pop-156000 7 car-free cities]</ref> It has the [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]] which was founded in 859 and the oldest continuously functioning [[university]] in the world. It also has [[Chouara Tannery]] from the 11th century, one of the oldest tanneries in the world.

His son, [[Idris II of Morocco|Idris II]] (808),<ref>\"Fes\". ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 3 Mar. 2007</ref> built a settlement on the opposing river bank. These settlements would soon develop into two walled and largely autonomous sites, often in conflict with one another: ''Madinat Fas'' and ''Al-'Aliya''. In 808 Al-'Aliya replaced [[Volubilis|Walili]] as the capital of the Idrisids.\n\nArab emigration to Fez, including approximately 800 Andalusi families of mixed Arab and Iberian descent<ref>{{Google books |id=6tFvlaM1LmgC |page=463 |title=The Places Where Men Pray Together }} p. 55</ref> in 817\u2013818 expelled after a rebellion against the Umayyads of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], and 2000 Arab families banned from [[Kairouan]] (modern Tunisia) after another rebellion in 824, gave the city its Arabic character. The Andalusians settled in what was called the Fez, while the Tunisians found their home in al-'Aliya. These two waves of immigrants would subsequently give their name to the sites 'Adwat Al-Andalus and 'Adwat al-Qarawiyyin.<ref>''A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period'' By Jamil Mir'i Abun-Nasr. p. 51.</ref> With the influx of Arabic-speaking Andalusians and Turnisians, the majority of the population was Arab, but rural Berbers from the surrounding countryside settled there throughout this early period, mainly in Madinat Fas (the Andalusian quarter) and later in [[Fes Jdid]] during the Marinid period.<ref>{{Google books |id=u4X1s7S0ZdgC |page=9 |title=Realm of Saints }}</ref>\n\nUpon the death of Idris II in 828, the dynasty\u2019s territory was divided among his sons. The eldest, Muhammad, received Fez. The newly fragmented Idrisid power would never again be reunified. During [[Yahya ibn Muhammad]]'s rule in Fez the Kairouyine [[mosque]], one of the oldest and largest in Africa, was built and its associated [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]] was founded (859).<ref>''Merriam Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia''. p.574.</ref> Comparatively little is known about Idrisid Fez, owing to the lack of comprehensive historical narratives and that little has survived of the architecture and infrastructure of early Fez (Al-'Aliya). The sources that mention Idrisid Fez, describe a rather rural one, not having the cultural sophistication of the important cities of [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Ifriqiya]].\n\nIn the 10th century, the city was contested by the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Tunisia, who ruled the city through a host of [[Zenata]] clients. The Fatimids took the city in 927 and expelled the Idrissids, after which their [[Miknasa]] were installed there. The Miknasa were driven out of Fez in 980 by the [[Maghrawa]], their fellow Zenata, allies of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. It was in this period that the great Andalusian ruler [[Almanzor]] commissioned the Maghrawa to rebuild and refurnish the Al-Kairouan mosque, giving it much of its current appearance. According to the ''[[Rawd al-Qirtas]]'' and other Marinid era sources, the Maghrawi emir [[Dunas Al-Maghrawi]] filled up the open spaces between the two medinas and the banks of the river, dividing them with new constructions. Thus, the two cities grew into each other, being now only separated by their walls and the river. His sons fortified the city to a great extent. This could not keep the Almoravid emir Ibn Tashfin from conquering it in 1070, after more than a decade of battling the Zenata warriors in the area and constant besieging of the city.\n\nIn 1033, several thousand Jews were killed in [[1033 Fez massacre|the Fez Massacre]].\n\n=== Golden age and the Marinid period ===\n\nMadinat Fas and Al-'Aliya were united in 1070 by the [[Almoravid dynasty]]: The walls dividing them were destroyed, bridges connecting them were built, and connecting walls were constructed that unified the medinas. Under Almoravid patronage the largest expansion and renovation of the Great Mosque of [[University of al-Qarawiyyin|al-Qarawiyyin]] took place (1134-1143). Although the capital was moved to Marrakesh under the Almoravids, Fez acquired a reputation for [[Maliki]] legal scholarship and became an important centre of trade. Almoravid impact on the city's structure was such that the second Almoravid ruler, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], is often considered to be the second founder of Fez.<ref>{{Google books |id=Rfxoq5MzHa4C |page=43 |title=The Almoravids and the Meanings of Jihad }} (p.51)</ref>\n\nLike many Moroccan cities, Fez was greatly enlarged during the [[Almohad Caliphate]] and saw its previously dominating rural aspect lessen. This was accomplished partly by the settling there of Andalusians and the further improvement of the infrastructure. At the start of the 13th century they broke down the Idrisid city walls and constructed new ones, which covered a much wider space. These Almohad walls exist to this day as the outline of [[Fes el Bali]]. Under Almohad rule the city grew to become one of the largest in the world between 1170 and 1180, with an estimated 200,000 people living there.<ref>{{Google books |id=hEvCpNW2qBwC |page=252 |title=Morocco 2009 }} (p.252)</ref>\n\nIn 1250 Fez regained its capital status under the [[Marinid dynasty]].

Mellah was a traditional Jewish quarter of the city.]]\nThe Jewish quarter of Fez, the [[Mellah of Fez|Mellah]] was built in 1438, near the royal residence in Fez Jdid. The Mellah at first consisted of Jews from Fez el Bali and soon saw the arrival of [[Berber Jews]] from the Atlas range and Jewish immigrants from [[al-Andalus]]. The Marinids spread the influence Idris I and encouraged Malikism, financing sharifian families as a way some say to legitimize their rule: In the 14th century, hundreds of families throughout Morocco tried to claim descent from [[Idris I]], especially in Fez and the Rif mountains. In this regard, the Alaouite Sultan of Morocco, [[Moulay Ismail]], established a syndicate responsible of verifying, through thorough historical, genealogical and scientific evidence, Moroccan families' [[sharifian]] ancestries of Idrissi and Alaouite descent which is still operating to this day under the official name in Arabic of (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628), their official website is the following: [http://chorafae.com chorafae.com].

However, in the 16th century, the [[Saadis]], based in [[Marrakech]], would attempt to overthrow the Wattasids. In the meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]] came close to Fez after the conquest of Oujda in the 16th century. In January 1549 the Saadi sultan [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] took Fez and ousted the last Wattasid sultan [[Ali Abu Hassun]]. They later retook the city in 1553 with Ottoman support. However, this reconquest was short-lived, and in 1554 the Wattasids were decisively defeated in the [[battle of Tadla]] by the Saadis. The Ottomans would try to invade Morocco after the assassination of Mohammed ash-Sheikh in 1558, but were defeated by his son [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] at the [[battle of Wadi al-Laban]] north of Fez.

The latter would flee to Portugal where he asked king [[Sebastian of Portugal]] for help to regain his throne. This would lead to the [[Battle of Alcacer Quibir]] where Abd al-Malik's army would defeat the invading Portuguese army with the support of his Ottoman allies, ensuring Moroccan independence. Abd al-Malik himself also died during the battle and would be succeeded by [[Ahmad al-Mansur]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Saadi dynasty (1649), Fez was a major trading post of the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Until the 19th century it was the only source of [[fez]]zes (also known as the ''tarboosh''). Then manufacturing began in France and Turkey as well. Originally, the dye for the hats came from a berry that was grown outside the city, known as the Turkish ''k\u0131z\u0131lc\u0131k'' or Greek ''akenia'' (''[[Cornus mas]]''). Fez was also the end of a north-south gold trading route from [[Timbuktu]]. Fez was a prime manufacturing location for embroidery and leather goods such as the [[Adarga]].\n\nThe city became independent in 1790, under the leadership of Yazid (1790\u20131792) and later of Abu\u00b4r-Rabi Sulayman. In 1795 control of the city returned to Morocco. Fez took part in a rebellion in 1819-1821, led by Ibrahim ibn Yazid, as well as in the 1832 rebellion led by Muhammad ibn Tayyib.\n\nThe [[Tijaniyyah|Tijani]] Sufi order, started by [[Ahmad al-Tijani]] (d. 1815), had its spiritual center in Fes. The order spread quickly among the literary elite of North West Africa, and its ''[[ulama]]'', or theologians, had significant religious, intellectual, and political influence in Fes and beyond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brigaglia|first=Andrea|title=Sufi Revival and Islamic Literacy: Tijaniyya Writings in Twentieth-Century Nigeria|url=https://www.academia.edu/9668574|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFes played a central role in the ''[[Hafidhiya]]'', the brief civil war that erupted when [[List of rulers of Morocco|Sultan]] [[Abd al-Hafid of Morocco|Abd al-Hafid]] challenged his heavily Europe-allied brother[[Abdelaziz of Morocco|Abdelaziz]] for the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller, Susan Gilson.|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=76|oclc=855022840}}</ref> \n\nThe French Colonel [[Charles \u00c9mile Moinier]] arrived in Fes March 15, 1908 at the head of the [[Zouave|4e Zouaves]], an infantry unit composed of Tunisian ''[[troupes coloniales]]''.

Rabat then remained the capital even after Morocco achieved independence in 1955.\n\nDespite its traditional character, there is a modern section: the \"New City\". Today it is a bustling commercial center. \n\nPlace Lalla Yeddouna at the heart of the Medina is currently undergoing reconstruction and preservation measures following a design competition sponsored by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (Washington D.C.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcc.gov/where-we-work/program/morocco-compact|title=Morocco Compact - Millennium Challenge Corporation|website=Mcc.gov|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> and the Government of the [[Morocco]]. The construction projects scheduled for completion in 2016 encompass historic preservation of particular buildings, construction of new buildings that fit into the existing urban fabric and regeneration of the riverfront. The intention is to not only preserve the quality and characteristics of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], but to encourage the development of the area as a sustainable, mixed-use area for artisanal industries and local residents.\n\n== Climate ==\nLocated by the Atlas Mountains, Fez has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with a strong continental influence, shifting from relatively cool and wet in the winter to dry and hot days in the summer months between June and September. Rainfall can reach up to {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} in good years. The winter highs typically reach around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December\u2013January. Frost is not uncommon during the winter period. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are {{convert|46.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-8.2|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.(''see weather-table below'').\nFez's climate is strongly similar to that of [[Seville]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain. Snowfall on average occurs once every 3 to 5 years. Fez recorded snowfall in three straight years in 2005, 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118081428/http://www.aemet.es/en/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010 |archivedate=2012-11-18 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/africa/mor_al/Fes_e.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"voodooskies.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20151006064153/http://voodooskies.com/weather/morocco/fes/monthly/temperature]</ref><ref name=Meoweather />\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Fez\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C= 25.0\n|Feb record high C= 30.5\n|Mar record high C= 33.3\n|Apr record high C= 37.0\n|May record high C= 40.8\n|Jun record high C= 44.0\n|Jul record high C= 46.7\n|Aug record high C= 44.4\n|Sep record high C= 41.7\n|Oct record high C= 37.5\n|Nov record high C= 31.2\n|Dec record high C= 27.0\n|year record high C= 46.7\n|Jan high C = 15.1\n|Feb high C = 16.5\n|Mar high C = 18.3\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 23.9\n|Jun high C = 28.5\n|Jul high C = 33.9\n|Aug high C = 33.8\n|Sep high C = 30.4\n|Oct high C = 24.7\n|Nov high C = 19.3\n|Dec high C = 15.7\n|year high C = 23.3\n|Jan mean C  = 9.4\n|Feb mean C  = 10.8\n|Mar mean C  = 12.1\n|Apr mean C  = 13.7\n|May mean C  = 17.1\n|Jun mean C  = 21.0\n|Jul mean C  = 25.3\n|Aug mean C  = 25.4\n|Sep mean C  = 22.7\n|Oct mean C  = 18.1\n|Nov mean C  = 13.5\n|Dec mean C  = 10.1\n|year mean C = 16.6\n|Jan low C = 3.7\n|Feb low C = 5.0\n|Mar low C = 5.9\n|Apr low C = 7.6\n|May low C = 10.2\n|Jun low C = 13.4\n|Jul low C = 16.7\n|Aug low C = 17.0\n|Sep low C = 15.0\n|Oct low C = 11.4\n|Nov low C = 7.7\n|Dec low C = 4.6\n|year low C = 9.8\n|Jan record low C= -8.2\n|Feb record low C= -4.9\n|Mar record low C= -2.5\n|Apr record low C= -0.5\n|May record low C= 0.0\n|Jun record low C= 4.9\n|Jul record low C= 8.5\n|Aug record low C= 9.2\n|Sep record low C= 5.9\n|Oct record low C= 0.0\n|Nov record low C= -1.4\n|Dec record low C= -5.0\n|year record low C= -8.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 72.2\n|Feb rain mm = 100.4\n|Mar rain mm = 93.6\n|Apr rain mm = 87.7\n|May rain mm = 53.0\n|Jun rain mm = 24.4\n|Jul rain mm = 3.0\n|Aug rain mm = 3.6\n|Sep rain mm = 17.0\n|Oct rain mm = 62.3\n|Nov rain mm = 89.1\n|Dec rain mm = 85.2\n|year rain mm =\n| Jan rain days  =12.1\n| Feb rain days  =13.2\n| Mar rain days  =13.5\n| Apr rain days  =13.5\n| May rain days  =10.2\n| Jun rain days  =5.3\n| Jul rain days  =1.6\n| Aug rain days  =1.8\n| Sep rain days  =4.7\n| Oct rain days  =9.1\n| Nov rain days  =12.7\n| Dec rain days  =12.1\n| year rain days =\n|Jan snow days = 0.2\n|Feb snow days = 0.0\n|Mar snow days = 0.0\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.0\n|Dec snow days = 0.0\n|year snow days = 0.2\n| Jand sun  =6\n| Febd sun  =6\n| Mard sun  =7\n| Aprd sun  =8\n| Mayd sun  =9\n| Jund sun  =10\n| Juld sun  =11\n| Augd sun  =10\n| Sepd sun  =9\n| Octd sun  =7\n| Novd sun  =6\n| Decd sun  =6\n| yeard sun =\n| Jan percentsun  =60\n| Feb percentsun  = 55\n| Mar percentsun  =58\n| Apr percentsun  =62\n| May percentsun  =64\n| Jun percentsun  =71\n| Jul percentsun  =79\n| Aug percentsun  =77\n| Sep percentsun  =75\n| Oct percentsun  =64\n| Nov percentsun  =60\n| Dec percentsun  =60\n| year percentsun =\n|source 1 = Hong Kong Observatory<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/africa/mor_al/Fes_e.htm\n |title      = Climatological Information for Fez, Morocco\n |publisher  = [[Hong Kong Observatory]]\n |date       = 15 August 2011\n |accessdate = 16 August 2012\n}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|date=August 2011\n|source 2 = Meoweather.com,<ref name=Meoweather>{{cite web|title=Weather history for Fez, Figuig, Morocco : Fez average weather by month|url=http://www.meoweather.com/history/Morocco/na/34.0527778/-4.9827778/Fez.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605060443/http://www.meoweather.com/history/Morocco/na/34.0527778/-4.9827778/Fez.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 June 2012|website=Meoweather.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Voodoo skies for extremes<ref name=\"voodooskies.com\"/> Weather Atlas <ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/morocco/fes-climate |title=Fes, Morocco -

It is distinct from Fez's now much larger Ville Nouvelle (new city) originally founded by the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French]]. Fes el-Bali is the site of the famous [[University of Al Quaraouiyine|Qarawiyyin University]] and the [[Zaouia Moulay Idriss II|Mausoleum of Moulay Idris II]], the most important religious and cultural sites, while Fez el-Jdid is the site of the enormous [[Dar al-Makhzen (Fez)|Royal Palace]], still used by the [[King of Morocco]] today. These two historic cities are linked together and are usually referred to together as the \"[[Medina quarter|medina]]\" of Fez, though this term is sometimes applied more restrictively to Fes el-Bali only.{{efn|''Medina'' is the Arabic word for \"city\", which in former French colonies in North Africa is also used to refer to the old part of a city, as the French largely generally built new cities (''Ville Nouvelles'') next to them and left the historic cities intact.}} Fez is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination and many non-Moroccans are now restoring traditional houses ([[Moroccan riad|riads]] and dars) as second homes in the medina.

However, the city rapidly developed as the military garrison center of the region during the Almoravid era, in which the military operations were commanded and carried out to other North African regions and Southern Europe to the north, and Senegal river to the south. Subsequently, it led to the construction of numerous forts, [[kasbah]]s, and towers for both garrison and defense. A \"kasbah\" in the context of [[Maghrebi]] region is the traditional military structure for fortification, military preparation, command and control.

It is surrounded by the high grounds, and the old city is penetrated by the [[Oued Fes|River of Fez]] flowing from the west to east.\n\nFez was founded under the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid rule]] during the 8th-9th centuries C.E. It consisted of two autonomous and competing settlements. The migration of 2000 Arab families in the early 9th century gave the nascent city its Arabic character. After the downfall of the Idrisid dynasty, several empires came and went until the 11th century when the [[Almoravid]] [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] united the two settlements and rebuilt the city, which became today's [[Fes el Bali]] quarter. Under the Almoravid rule, the city gained a reputation for the religious scholarship and the mercantile activity.\n\nFez reached its zenith in the [[Marinid]]-era, regaining the status as the capital. Numerous [[madrasa]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]s and [[Gates of Fez|city gate]]s were constructed which survived up until today. These buildings are considered the hallmarks of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and [[Moroccan architecture|Moroccan architectural styles]]. Marinid sultans also founded [[Fes Jdid]] quarter, where newer palaces and gardens were established. During this time, the Jewish population of the city grew as well, with the [[Mellah of Fez|Mellah]] (Jewish quarter) attracting the Jewish migrants from other North African regions. After the overthrow of the Marinid dynasty, the city largely declined and was replaced by Marrakesh for political and cultural influence, but remained as the capital under the [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasids]] and modern Morocco until 1912.\n\nToday, the city largely consists of two old [[medina quarter]]s, Fes el Bali and Fes Jdid, and modern urban area of Ville Nouvelle constructed during the French colonial era. The medina of Fez is listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] and is believed to be one of the world's largest urban [[pedestrian zone]]s (car-free areas).<ref>Mother Nature Network, [http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-car-free-cities/the-medina-of-fes-al-bali-morocco-pop-156000 7 car-free cities]</ref> It has the [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]] which was founded in 859 and the oldest continuously functioning [[university]] in the world.

His son, [[Idris II of Morocco|Idris II]] (808),<ref>\"Fes\". ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 3 Mar. 2007</ref> built a settlement on the opposing river bank. These settlements would soon develop into two walled and largely autonomous sites, often in conflict with one another: ''Madinat Fas'' and ''Al-'Aliya''. In 808 Al-'Aliya replaced [[Volubilis|Walili]] as the capital of the Idrisids.\n\nArab emigration to Fez, including approximately 800 Andalusi families of mixed Arab and Iberian descent<ref>{{Google books |id=6tFvlaM1LmgC |page=463 |title=The Places Where Men Pray Together }} p. 55</ref> in 817\u2013818 expelled after a rebellion against the Umayyads of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], and 2000 Arab families banned from [[Kairouan]] (modern Tunisia) after another rebellion in 824, gave the city its Arabic character. The Andalusians settled in what was called the Fez, while the Tunisians found their home in al-'Aliya. These two waves of immigrants would subsequently give their name to the sites 'Adwat Al-Andalus and 'Adwat al-Qarawiyyin.<ref>''A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period'' By Jamil Mir'i Abun-Nasr. p. 51.</ref> With the influx of Arabic-speaking Andalusians and Turnisians, the majority of the population was Arab, but rural Berbers from the surrounding countryside settled there throughout this early period, mainly in Madinat Fas (the Andalusian quarter) and later in [[Fes Jdid]] during the Marinid period.<ref>{{Google books |id=u4X1s7S0ZdgC |page=9 |title=Realm of Saints }}</ref>\n\nUpon the death of Idris II in 828, the dynasty\u2019s territory was divided among his sons. The eldest, Muhammad, received Fez. The newly fragmented Idrisid power would never again be reunified. During [[Yahya ibn Muhammad]]'s rule in Fez the Kairouyine [[mosque]], one of the oldest and largest in Africa, was built and its associated [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]] was founded (859).<ref>''Merriam Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia''. p.574.</ref> Comparatively little is known about Idrisid Fez, owing to the lack of comprehensive historical narratives and that little has survived of the architecture and infrastructure of early Fez (Al-'Aliya). The sources that mention Idrisid Fez, describe a rather rural one, not having the cultural sophistication of the important cities of [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Ifriqiya]].\n\nIn the 10th century, the city was contested by the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Tunisia, who ruled the city through a host of [[Zenata]] clients. The Fatimids took the city in 927 and expelled the Idrissids, after which their [[Miknasa]] were installed there. The Miknasa were driven out of Fez in 980 by the [[Maghrawa]], their fellow Zenata, allies of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. It was in this period that the great Andalusian ruler [[Almanzor]] commissioned the Maghrawa to rebuild and refurnish the Al-Kairouan mosque, giving it much of its current appearance. According to the ''[[Rawd al-Qirtas]]'' and other Marinid era sources, the Maghrawi emir [[Dunas Al-Maghrawi]] filled up the open spaces between the two medinas and the banks of the river, dividing them with new constructions. Thus, the two cities grew into each other, being now only separated by their walls and the river. His sons fortified the city to a great extent. This could not keep the Almoravid emir Ibn Tashfin from conquering it in 1070, after more than a decade of battling the Zenata warriors in the area and constant besieging of the city.\n\nIn 1033, several thousand Jews were killed in [[1033 Fez massacre|the Fez Massacre]].\n\n=== Golden age and the Marinid period ===\n\nMadinat Fas and Al-'Aliya were united in 1070 by the [[Almoravid dynasty]]: The walls dividing them were destroyed, bridges connecting them were built, and connecting walls were constructed that unified the medinas. Under Almoravid patronage the largest expansion and renovation of the Great Mosque of [[University of al-Qarawiyyin|al-Qarawiyyin]] took place (1134-1143). Although the capital was moved to Marrakesh under the Almoravids, Fez acquired a reputation for [[Maliki]] legal scholarship and became an important centre of trade. Almoravid impact on the city's structure was such that the second Almoravid ruler, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], is often considered to be the second founder of Fez.<ref>{{Google books |id=Rfxoq5MzHa4C |page=43 |title=The Almoravids and the Meanings of Jihad }} (p.51)</ref>\n\nLike many Moroccan cities, Fez was greatly enlarged during the [[Almohad Caliphate]] and saw its previously dominating rural aspect lessen. This was accomplished partly by the settling there of Andalusians and the further improvement of the infrastructure. At the start of the 13th century they broke down the Idrisid city walls and constructed new ones, which covered a much wider space. These Almohad walls exist to this day as the outline of [[Fes el Bali]].

Mellah was a traditional Jewish quarter of the city.]]\nThe Jewish quarter of Fez, the [[Mellah of Fez|Mellah]] was built in 1438, near the royal residence in Fez Jdid. The Mellah at first consisted of Jews from Fez el Bali and soon saw the arrival of [[Berber Jews]] from the Atlas range and Jewish immigrants from [[al-Andalus]]. The Marinids spread the influence Idris I and encouraged Malikism, financing sharifian families as a way some say to legitimize their rule: In the 14th century, hundreds of families throughout Morocco tried to claim descent from [[Idris I]], especially in Fez and the Rif mountains. In this regard, the Alaouite Sultan of Morocco, [[Moulay Ismail]], established a syndicate responsible of verifying, through thorough historical, genealogical and scientific evidence, Moroccan families' [[sharifian]] ancestries of Idrissi and Alaouite descent which is still operating to this day under the official name in Arabic of (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628), their official website is the following: [http://chorafae.com chorafae.com].

However, in the 16th century, the [[Saadis]], based in [[Marrakech]], would attempt to overthrow the Wattasids. In the meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]] came close to Fez after the conquest of Oujda in the 16th century. In January 1549 the Saadi sultan [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] took Fez and ousted the last Wattasid sultan [[Ali Abu Hassun]]. They later retook the city in 1553 with Ottoman support. However, this reconquest was short-lived, and in 1554 the Wattasids were decisively defeated in the [[battle of Tadla]] by the Saadis. The Ottomans would try to invade Morocco after the assassination of Mohammed ash-Sheikh in 1558, but were defeated by his son [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] at the [[battle of Wadi al-Laban]] north of Fez. Hence, Morocco remained the only North-African state to deter and defeat the Ottomans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/67/822.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219212840/http://www.bartleby.com/67/822.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 December 2007|title=3.

The latter would flee to Portugal where he asked king [[Sebastian of Portugal]] for help to regain his throne. This would lead to the [[Battle of Alcacer Quibir]] where Abd al-Malik's army would defeat the invading Portuguese army with the support of his Ottoman allies, ensuring Moroccan independence. Abd al-Malik himself also died during the battle and would be succeeded by [[Ahmad al-Mansur]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Saadi dynasty (1649), Fez was a major trading post of the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Until the 19th century it was the only source of [[fez]]zes (also known as the ''tarboosh''). Then manufacturing began in France and Turkey as well. Originally, the dye for the hats came from a berry that was grown outside the city, known as the Turkish ''k\u0131z\u0131lc\u0131k'' or Greek ''akenia'' (''[[Cornus mas]]''). Fez was also the end of a north-south gold trading route from [[Timbuktu]]. Fez was a prime manufacturing location for embroidery and leather goods such as the [[Adarga]].\n\nThe city became independent in 1790, under the leadership of Yazid (1790\u20131792) and later of Abu\u00b4r-Rabi Sulayman. In 1795 control of the city returned to Morocco. Fez took part in a rebellion in 1819-1821, led by Ibrahim ibn Yazid, as well as in the 1832 rebellion led by Muhammad ibn Tayyib.\n\nThe [[Tijaniyyah|Tijani]] Sufi order, started by [[Ahmad al-Tijani]] (d. 1815), had its spiritual center in Fes. The order spread quickly among the literary elite of North West Africa, and its ''[[ulama]]'', or theologians, had significant religious, intellectual, and political influence in Fes and beyond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brigaglia|first=Andrea|title=Sufi Revival and Islamic Literacy: Tijaniyya Writings in Twentieth-Century Nigeria|url=https://www.academia.edu/9668574|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFes played a central role in the ''[[Hafidhiya]]'', the brief civil war that erupted when [[List of rulers of Morocco|Sultan]] [[Abd al-Hafid of Morocco|Abd al-Hafid]] challenged his heavily Europe-allied brother[[Abdelaziz of Morocco|Abdelaziz]] for the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller, Susan Gilson.|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=76|oclc=855022840}}</ref> \n\nThe French Colonel [[Charles \u00c9mile Moinier]] arrived in Fes March 15, 1908 at the head of the [[Zouave|4e Zouaves]], an infantry unit composed of Tunisian ''[[troupes coloniales]]''.

The construction projects scheduled for completion in 2016 encompass historic preservation of particular buildings, construction of new buildings that fit into the existing urban fabric and regeneration of the riverfront. The intention is to not only preserve the quality and characteristics of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], but to encourage the development of the area as a sustainable, mixed-use area for artisanal industries and local residents.\n\n== Climate ==\nLocated by the Atlas Mountains, Fez has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with a strong continental influence, shifting from relatively cool and wet in the winter to dry and hot days in the summer months between June and September. Rainfall can reach up to {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} in good years. The winter highs typically reach around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December\u2013January. Frost is not uncommon during the winter period. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are {{convert|46.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-8.2|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.(''see weather-table below'').\nFez's climate is strongly similar to that of [[Seville]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain. Snowfall on average occurs once every 3 to 5 years. Fez recorded snowfall in three straight years in 2005, 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118081428/http://www.aemet.es/en/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010 |archivedate=2012-11-18 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/africa/mor_al/Fes_e.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"voodooskies.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20151006064153/http://voodooskies.com/weather/morocco/fes/monthly/temperature]</ref><ref name=Meoweather />\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Fez\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C= 25.0\n|Feb record high C= 30.5\n|Mar record high C= 33.3\n|Apr record high C= 37.0\n|May record high C= 40.8\n|Jun record high C= 44.0\n|Jul record high C= 46.7\n|Aug record high C= 44.4\n|Sep record high C= 41.7\n|Oct record high C= 37.5\n|Nov record high C= 31.2\n|Dec record high C= 27.0\n|year record high C= 46.7\n|Jan high C = 15.1\n|Feb high C = 16.5\n|Mar high C = 18.3\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 23.9\n|Jun high C = 28.5\n|Jul high C = 33.9\n|Aug high C = 33.8\n|Sep high C = 30.4\n|Oct high C = 24.7\n|Nov high C = 19.3\n|Dec high C = 15.7\n|year high C = 23.3\n|Jan mean C  = 9.4\n|Feb mean C  = 10.8\n|Mar mean C  = 12.1\n|Apr mean C  = 13.7\n|May mean C  = 17.1\n|Jun mean C  = 21.0\n|Jul mean C  = 25.3\n|Aug mean C  = 25.4\n|Sep mean C  = 22.7\n|Oct mean C  = 18.1\n|Nov mean C  = 13.5\n|Dec mean C  = 10.1\n|year mean C = 16.6\n|Jan low C = 3.7\n|Feb low C = 5.0\n|Mar low C = 5.9\n|Apr low C = 7.6\n|May low C = 10.2\n|Jun low C = 13.4\n|Jul low C = 16.7\n|Aug low C = 17.0\n|Sep low C = 15.0\n|Oct low C = 11.4\n|Nov low C = 7.7\n|Dec low C = 4.6\n|year low C = 9.8\n|Jan record low C= -8.2\n|Feb record low C= -4.9\n|Mar record low C= -2.5\n|Apr record low C= -0.5\n|May record low C= 0.0\n|Jun record low C= 4.9\n|Jul record low C= 8.5\n|Aug record low C= 9.2\n|Sep record low C= 5.9\n|Oct record low C= 0.0\n|Nov record low C= -1.4\n|Dec record low C= -5.0\n|year record low C= -8.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 72.2\n|Feb rain mm = 100.4\n|Mar rain mm = 93.6\n|Apr rain mm = 87.7\n|May rain mm = 53.0\n|Jun rain mm = 24.4\n|Jul rain mm = 3.0\n|Aug rain mm = 3.6\n|Sep rain mm = 17.0\n|Oct rain mm = 62.3\n|Nov rain mm = 89.1\n|Dec rain mm = 85.2\n|year rain mm =\n| Jan rain days  =12.1\n| Feb rain days  =13.2\n| Mar rain days  =13.5\n| Apr rain days  =13.5\n| May rain days  =10.2\n| Jun rain days  =5.3\n| Jul rain days  =1.6\n| Aug rain days  =1.8\n| Sep rain days  =4.7\n| Oct rain days  =9.1\n| Nov rain days  =12.7\n| Dec rain days  =12.1\n| year rain days =\n|Jan snow days = 0.2\n|Feb snow days = 0.0\n|Mar snow days = 0.0\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.0\n|Dec snow days = 0.0\n|year snow days = 0.2\n| Jand sun  =6\n| Febd sun  =6\n| Mard sun  =7\n| Aprd sun  =8\n| Mayd sun  =9\n| Jund sun  =10\n| Juld sun  =11\n| Augd sun  =10\n| Sepd sun  =9\n| Octd sun  =7\n| Novd sun  =6\n| Decd sun  =6\n| yeard sun =\n| Jan percentsun  =60\n| Feb percentsun  = 55\n| Mar percentsun  =58\n| Apr percentsun  =62\n| May percentsun  =64\n| Jun percentsun  =71\n| Jul percentsun  =79\n| Aug percentsun  =77\n| Sep percentsun  =75\n| Oct percentsun  =64\n| Nov percentsun  =60\n| Dec percentsun  =60\n| year percentsun =\n|source 1 = Hong Kong Observatory<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/africa/mor_al/Fes_e.htm\n |title      = Climatological Information for Fez, Morocco\n |publisher  = [[Hong Kong Observatory]]\n |date       = 15 August 2011\n |accessdate = 16 August 2012\n}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|date=August 2011\n|source 2 = Meoweather.com,<ref name=Meoweather>{{cite web|title=Weather history for Fez, Figuig, Morocco : Fez average weather by month|url=http://www.meoweather.com/history/Morocco/na/34.0527778/-4.9827778/Fez.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605060443/http://www.meoweather.com/history/Morocco/na/34.0527778/-4.9827778/Fez.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 June 2012|website=Meoweather.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Voodoo skies for extremes<ref name=\"voodooskies.com\"/> Weather Atlas <ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/morocco/fes-climate |title=Fes, Morocco -

{"title_page": "Misclassification of employees as independent contractors", "text_new": "{{UStaxation}}\n'''Misclassification of employees as independent contractors''' is the way in which the [[United States]] classifies the problem of [[false self-employment]]. It can occur with respect to tax treatment or the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].\n\nThe U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) reports that the IRS claims to lose millions of dollars in uncollected payroll, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and unemployment insurance taxes because of misclassification of independent contractors by taxpayers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96130t.pdf|title=Issues in Classifying Workers as Employees or Independent Contractors: Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Oversight Committee on Ways and Means|last=Gandhi|first=Natwar M.|date=1996-06-20|website=[[United States General Accounting Office]]|format=PDF|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner]] [[Mark W. Everson]] in a statement made November 3, 2005, IRS audits of small businesses organized as corporations increased from 7,294 in 2004 to 17,867 in 2005. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=150358,00.html]\n\n==Recent examples of disputes over misclassification==\nMore and more Uber drivers are claiming to be employees, despite their classification as independent contractors. More are suing after California passed law aimed at requiring gig economy companies to classify workers as employees that took effect January 1, 2020.[https://www.wired.com/story/courts-decide-uber-drivers-employees/] Likewise, many more workers in the gig economy are making similar claims. This goes for for example Amazon's \"last mile\" delivery drivers and FedEx's ground delivery drivers.[https://uidl.naswa.org/ds2/stream/?#/documents/64/page/2]\n\n==Taxation==\nEmployers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS forms [[Form W-2|W-2]] and [[Form 1099-MISC|1099]], respectively. Employers pay various [[tax]]es (i.e. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment tax]]es, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. These taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. Instead, the contractor is responsible for their employer's share of the taxes when paying self-employment taxes at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasovertimeattorney.com/blog/withholding-for-payroll-taxes-and-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors-why-this-ca.cfm|title=Withholding for Payroll Taxes & Misclassifying Workers as Independent Contractors: Why This Can Hurt You at Tax Time.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nClassification affects whether a worker can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund (since there is no one to claim benefits).\n\nWorkers classified as independent contractors whose contract is terminated can contact their state unemployment agency (for example [[Employment Development Department]] (EDD) in California) and file a claim for unemployment. EDD investigates and determines whether the worker was misclassified, and potentially award unemployment benefits. According to state-level studies, 10% to 20% of employers misclassify at least one worker as an independent contractor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/independent-contractor-misclassification/|title=(In)dependent Contractor Misclassification|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reclassification==\nIRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) [[independent contractors]] are recategorized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as [[Form W-2|W-2]] [[employee]]s. The reclassification can result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and back-taxes for which the [[employer]] is generally liable.\n\n==Employee vs. independent contractor==\nIRS regulations state that a worker is an employee if the employer can control what is to be done and how it is to be done. This was codified in revenue ruling 87-41, and is generally called \"the twenty factor test\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf|title=Publication 15-A: Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide (for use in 2017)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-05|website=|publisher=Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee|title=Independent Contractor (Self-Employed) or Employee?|website=www.irs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> By contrast, if the worker controls the means and method of achieving the required results, leaving the employer with the right only to define the desired result, they are correctly classified as an independent contractor.\n\nEmployees and independent contractors have very different benefits. Employees are entitled to the protection of wage and hour laws and are protected from discrimination and retaliation by employers. Employees may be legally entitled to family medical leave and benefits such as medical insurance and pension plans. Employees are entitled to bargain collectively with their employers.{{clarify|date=April 2019}} Employees are entitled to workers' compensation for job-related injuries and employers must pay into social security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance for their employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employee-benefits|title=Employee Benefits|website=www.irs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> No benefits or employer tax payments are available to contractors, who must pay for their own benefits and unemployment taxes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/technology/in-the-sharing-economy-workers-find-both-freedom-and-uncertainty.html|title=In the Sharing Economy, Workers Find Both Freedom and Uncertainty|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2014-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a worker is by default recognized as an employee unless otherwise stated and specific criteria are met. It is not enough to only classify a worker as an \"[[independent contractor]]\" in their contract, they also need to actually be treated as an independent contractor.[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12156401043773771981&q=abc+test+independent+contractor&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 (source)]\n\nService sector employees are more likely than others to be misclassified as independent contractors.

[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=150358,00.html]\n\n==Taxation==\nEmployers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS forms [[Form W-2|W-2]] and [[Form 1099-MISC|1099]], respectively. Employers pay various [[tax]]es (i.e. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment tax]]es, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. These taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. Instead, the contractor is responsible for their employer's share of the taxes when paying self-employment taxes at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasovertimeattorney.com/blog/withholding-for-payroll-taxes-and-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors-why-this-ca.cfm|title=Withholding for Payroll Taxes & Misclassifying Workers as Independent Contractors: Why This Can Hurt You at Tax Time.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nClassification affects whether a worker can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund (since there is no one to claim benefits).\n\nWorkers classified as independent contractors whose contract is terminated can contact their state unemployment agency (for example [[Employment Development Department]] (EDD) in California) and file a claim for unemployment. EDD investigates and determines whether the worker was misclassified, and potentially award unemployment benefits. According to state-level studies, 10% to 20% of employers misclassify at least one worker as an independent contractor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/independent-contractor-misclassification/|title=(In)dependent Contractor Misclassification|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reclassification==\nIRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) [[independent contractors]] are recategorized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as [[Form W-2|W-2]] [[employee]]s. The reclassification can result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and back-taxes for which the [[employer]] is generally liable.\n\n==Employee vs. independent contractor==\nIRS regulations state that a worker is an employee if the employer can control what is to be done and how it is to be done. This was codified in revenue ruling 87-41, and is generally called \"the twenty factor test\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf|title=Publication 15-A: Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide (for use in 2017)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-05|website=|publisher=Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee|title=Independent Contractor (Self-Employed) or Employee?|website=www.irs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> By contrast, if the worker controls the means and method of achieving the required results, leaving the employer with the right only to define the desired result, they are correctly classified as an independent contractor.\n\nEmployees and independent contractors have very different benefits.
