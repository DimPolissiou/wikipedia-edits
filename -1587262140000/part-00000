The airport, located just off [[Bryan Boulevard (Greensboro)|Bryan Boulevard]], sits on a 3,770 acre (1,526 ha) campus and has 3 runways.<ref name=\"FAA\" /> Piedmont Triad International airport is the third busiest airport in North Carolina averaging 280 takeoffs and landings each day. PTI is owned and operated by the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority.\n\nThis airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year.<ref>[https://www.gcr1.com/5010web/airport.cfm?Site=GSO&AptSecNum=1 AirportIQ 5010]</ref>\n\nA proposal to rename the airport to \"Central North Carolina International Airport\" passed in December 2017; the renaming was slated to become effective on January 1, 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/piedmont-triad-international-airport-to-be-renamed/article_81fde0fa-bf36-57f2-8d70-275f144500fb.html|title=Greensboro mayor on board with PTIA renaming|work=[[News and Record]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> Due to public objections, however, the name change is on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/what-s-in-a-name-pti-is-holding-on-to/article_693ef5d3-2f2e-52f2-a9d1-ebe4d5cd1628.html|title=What's in a name?

With its two intersecting [[runways]] measuring {{convert|1890|ft|m}} and {{convert|1249|ft|m}}, hangar space, and even an early day equivalent of a [[Fixed-Base Operator]] that made sure the torches were lit at dusk, Maynard Field was named to honor a young [[North Carolinian]] pilot named Lt. Belvin Maynard. By 1922 it had competition to the west with Miller Field in Winston-Salem, and Charles Field, a single airstrip that was used mainly for [[barnstorming]], and for take-off drills and landings for the Charles family.\n\nPiedmont Triad International Airport had its start in 1927 when the Tri-City Airport Commission selected {{convert|112|acre|ha|0}} near the community of Friendship for an airport, and petitioned to become a stop along the congressionally authorized airmail route from New York to New Orleans.  Racing pilot Captain Roscoe Turner referred to the current location of Piedmont Triad International Airport as \"the best landing field in the south.\" Friendship, near [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], was selected over neighboring [[Winston-Salem]], which subsequently refused to contribute funds for airport construction and nullified the Tri-City Airport Authority collaborative effort.<ref name=\"Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980\">Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. \"The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. To 1980, A.D.\" Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980.</ref>\n\nGreensboro and Guilford County jointly purchased the Friendship property from Paul C. and Helen G. Lindley, and named it '''Lindley Field''' in May 1927 with 12,000 people in attendance. The field then had no runways, no lights, no hangar, and no passenger station. Charles Lindbergh stopped at Lindley Field with the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" on his cross-country tour celebrating the advances of aviation on October 14, 1927. Regular mail service started in 1928.<ref>Arnett, Ethel Stephens. \"Greensboro, North Carolina: The County Seat of Guilford.\" Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1955.</ref>\n\nPitcairn Aviation, Incorporated was given the contract to fly the airmail route, the second official airmail route in the United States, and Pitcairn Aviation made the first delivery of airmail in North Carolina on May 1, 1928. Sid Malloy, the pilot of the aircraft, landed with two bags of mail and took three bags of mail to be sent to Atlanta. After a brief closure during the Great Depression, the airport reopened on May 17, 1937 with two all-weather runways. In time, Pitcairn Aviation built a hangar; Greensboro built a passenger station; the United States government established a weather bureau; and the Department of Commerce set up a radio tower. Passenger service was inaugurated by Dixie Flying Service on November 6, 1930, with a route to Washington, D.C.. Pitcairn Aviation took over the route under its new name Eastern Air Transport, which later became Eastern Air Lines.<ref name=\"Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980\"/>\n\nIn July 1942 responsibility for the airport was given to the Greensboro-High Point Airport Authority, with representatives from Greensboro, High Point, and Guilford County. Shortly thereafter the Army Air Corps requisitioned the airport and its facilities for war use and airmail and passenger service was discontinued. The Corps lengthened the runways and built a new passenger terminal. Civilian service resumed after the war, though growth was moderate due to the success of nearby [[Smith Reynolds Airport]] in [[Winston-Salem]].\n\nA new passenger terminal opened in 1958, replacing the temporary facility that had served since World War II. The terminal was a modern glass paneled structure with a single pier. PTI was then served by Eastern, Piedmont, and Capital (which merged with United in 1961). The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed departures each weekday by Eastern (17), Piedmont (9), and Capital (7).\n\nDuring the 1970s the airport was renamed Greensboro-High Point Airport and then later Greensboro&ndash;High Point&ndash;Winston-Salem Regional Airport. Work on a new facility began in 1978 and the airport gained a greater prominence on the East Coast, offering passenger service from [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u201389)|Piedmont Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] and [[Eastern Air Lines]]. Cargo carriers, including the postal service, textile manufacturers, and Federal Express&ndash;a new overnight letter and package delivery service&ndash;were shipping tons of freight each year. By 1975, airport officials began to plan for a new terminal. Piedmont Airlines announced its intention to consolidate its operations at Greensboro, but in the months that followed, opened a hub in Charlotte instead.\n\nThe new terminal complex was completed in 1982, designed by [[Reynolds, Smith & Hills]] and AHM Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://charleshagenah.com/graphics/graphics/graphics2.htm |title=Charles Hagenah Architects, Inc: Early Experience |publisher=}}</ref> The following year, the Marriott opened a $16 million, 300-room hotel on the airport property. The facility was renamed Piedmont Triad International Airport in 1987.\n\nTIMCO Aviation Services (now Haeco Americas) opened its world headquarters at PTI in 1990, and grew into one of the world's largest independent aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers. In 1993, [[Continental Lite]], established a hub at PTI, but by 1995 the hub lost its parent company, [[Continental Airlines]] $140 million and Continental ceased hub operations at PTI.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/business/company-reports-continental-is-dropping-lite-service.html |title=Continental Is Dropping 'Lite' Service |date=April 14, 1995 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> In 1998 FedEx Corporation announced its intentions to build a mid-Atlantic hub at PTI, one of only five FedEx hubs in the country. In addition to the hub, the project included the construction of a parallel, 9,000-foot runway.\n\n[[Delta Connection]] carrier [[Comair]] built a maintenance hangar at PTI to perform work on their CRJ's in 2005. The airport also opened an expansion to the North Concourse, which added another 40,000 square feet to the terminal and brought the number of gates to 25. It also opened a 43,000 square-foot expansion to the main terminal to accommodate security gates at the north and south concourse.\n\nFedEx opened its mid-Atlantic Hub at the Airport in 2003,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greensboro.com/business/fedex-hiring-expansion-to-begin-sept-with-eight-new-flights/article_c9db7d0f-5a9f-53a4-b772-e69818529986.html |title=FedEx hiring, expansion to begin Sept. 4 with eight new flights being added at its PTI airport hub |last=Craver |first=Richard |work=Winston-Salem Journal |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref> and in 2006, Honda Aircraft Company selected PTI as its global headquarters.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Honda Aircraft Company to Establish World Headquarters and Production Facility in Greensboro, NC |url=https://www.hondajet.com/news/article?articleType=pressrelease&categoryType=842b50e3-3e33-47ed-bfad-5583a40d0def |location=Greensboro, NC |publisher=[[Honda]] |date=February 9, 2007 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>[[Allegiant Air]] began service to [[Orlando Sanford International Airport]] and [[St. Petersburg\u2013Clearwater International Airport]] in late May 2007.\n\nThe airport completed a new 9,000-foot parallel runway in 2010. In 2011 PTI began a renovation project that included new furnishings, automated baggage handling, free wireless internet, charging stations for passenger devices, and interactive kiosks to guide passengers to ground transportation, lodging, and restaurants.\n\nIn July 2017 [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] announced non-stop service to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare International Airport]]. In September 2018 [[Spirit Airlines]] announced service to [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], and [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]].\n\n==Terminals and facilities==\nCompleted in 1982, the terminal building of Piedmont Triad International Airport currently has 26 passenger [[gate (airport)|gates]]: 14 on the north concourse, and 12 on the south concourse. A 2006 expansion added another {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} to the terminal (at a cost of $5 million); a substantial part of this space was used to establish more permanent security checkpoints. Both concourses are the same size, despite the different gate numbers. There are two passenger accessible levels of the terminal. The top includes ticketing, security, boarding, and concession areas.

With its two intersecting [[runways]] measuring {{convert|1890|ft|m}} and {{convert|1249|ft|m}}, hangar space, and even an early day equivalent of a [[Fixed-Base Operator]] that made sure the torches were lit at dusk, Maynard Field was named to honor a young [[North Carolinian]] pilot named Lt. Belvin Maynard. By 1922 it had competition to the west with Miller Field in Winston-Salem, and Charles Field, a single airstrip that was used mainly for [[barnstorming]], and for take-off drills and landings for the Charles family.\n\nPiedmont Triad International Airport had its start in 1927 when the Tri-City Airport Commission selected {{convert|112|acre|ha|0}} near the community of Friendship for an airport, and petitioned to become a stop along the congressionally authorized airmail route from New York to New Orleans.  Racing pilot Captain Roscoe Turner referred to the current location of Piedmont Triad International Airport as \"the best landing field in the south.\" Friendship, near [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], was selected over neighboring [[Winston-Salem]], which subsequently refused to contribute funds for airport construction and nullified the Tri-City Airport Authority collaborative effort.<ref name=\"Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980\">Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. \"The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. To 1980, A.D.\" Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980.</ref>\n\nGreensboro and Guilford County jointly purchased the Friendship property from Paul C. and Helen G. Lindley, and named it '''Lindley Field''' in May 1927 with 12,000 people in attendance. The field then had no runways, no lights, no hangar, and no passenger station. Charles Lindbergh stopped at Lindley Field with the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" on his cross-country tour celebrating the advances of aviation on October 14, 1927. Regular mail service started in 1928.<ref>Arnett, Ethel Stephens. \"Greensboro, North Carolina: The County Seat of Guilford.\" Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1955.</ref>\n\nPitcairn Aviation, Incorporated was given the contract to fly the airmail route, the second official airmail route in the United States, and Pitcairn Aviation made the first delivery of airmail in North Carolina on May 1, 1928. Sid Malloy, the pilot of the aircraft, landed with two bags of mail and took three bags of mail to be sent to Atlanta. After a brief closure during the Great Depression, the airport reopened on May 17, 1937 with two all-weather runways. In time, Pitcairn Aviation built a hangar; Greensboro built a passenger station; the United States government established a weather bureau; and the Department of Commerce set up a radio tower. Passenger service was inaugurated by Dixie Flying Service on November 6, 1930, with a route to Washington, D.C.. Pitcairn Aviation took over the route under its new name Eastern Air Transport, which later became Eastern Air Lines.<ref name=\"Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980\"/>\n\nIn July 1942 responsibility for the airport was given to the Greensboro-High Point Airport Authority, with representatives from Greensboro, High Point, and Guilford County. Shortly thereafter the Army Air Corps requisitioned the airport and its facilities for war use and airmail and passenger service was discontinued. The Corps lengthened the runways and built a new passenger terminal. Civilian service resumed after the war, though growth was moderate due to the success of nearby [[Smith Reynolds Airport]] in [[Winston-Salem]].\n\nA new passenger terminal opened in 1958, replacing the temporary facility that had served since World War II. The terminal was a modern glass paneled structure with a single pier. PTI was then served by Eastern, Piedmont, and Capital (which merged with United in 1961). The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed departures each weekday by Eastern (17), Piedmont (9), and Capital (7).\n\nDuring the 1970s the airport was renamed Greensboro-High Point Airport and then later Greensboro&ndash;High Point&ndash;Winston-Salem Regional Airport. Work on a new facility began in 1978 and the airport gained a greater prominence on the East Coast, offering passenger service from [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u201389)|Piedmont Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] and [[Eastern Air Lines]]. Cargo carriers, including the postal service, textile manufacturers, and Federal Express&ndash;a new overnight letter and package delivery service&ndash;were shipping tons of freight each year. By 1975, airport officials began to plan for a new terminal. Piedmont Airlines announced its intention to consolidate its operations at Greensboro, but in the months that followed, opened a hub in Charlotte instead.\n\nThe new terminal complex was completed in 1982, designed by [[Reynolds, Smith & Hills]] and AHM Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://charleshagenah.com/graphics/graphics/graphics2.htm |title=Charles Hagenah Architects, Inc: Early Experience |publisher=}}</ref> The following year, the Marriott opened a $16 million, 300-room hotel on the airport property. The facility was renamed Piedmont Triad International Airport in 1987.\n\nTIMCO Aviation Services (now Haeco Americas) opened its world headquarters at PTI in 1990, and grew into one of the world's largest independent aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers. In 1993, [[Continental Lite]], established a hub at PTI, but by 1995 the hub lost its parent company, [[Continental Airlines]] $140 million and Continental ceased hub operations at PTI.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/business/company-reports-continental-is-dropping-lite-service.html |title=Continental Is Dropping 'Lite' Service |date=April 14, 1995 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> In 1998 FedEx Corporation announced its intentions to build a mid-Atlantic hub at PTI, one of only five FedEx hubs in the country. In addition to the hub, the project included the construction of a parallel, 9,000-foot runway.\n\n[[Delta Connection]] carrier [[Comair]] built a maintenance hangar at PTI to perform work on their CRJ's in 2005. The airport also opened an expansion to the North Concourse, which added another 40,000 square feet to the terminal and brought the number of gates to 25. It also opened a 43,000 square-foot expansion to the main terminal to accommodate security gates at the north and south concourse.\n\nFedEx opened its mid-Atlantic Hub at the Airport in 2003,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greensboro.com/business/fedex-hiring-expansion-to-begin-sept-with-eight-new-flights/article_c9db7d0f-5a9f-53a4-b772-e69818529986.html |title=FedEx hiring, expansion to begin Sept. 4 with eight new flights being added at its PTI airport hub |last=Craver |first=Richard |work=Winston-Salem Journal |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref> and in 2006, Honda Aircraft Company selected PTI as its global headquarters.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Honda Aircraft Company to Establish World Headquarters and Production Facility in Greensboro, NC |url=https://www.hondajet.com/news/article?articleType=pressrelease&categoryType=842b50e3-3e33-47ed-bfad-5583a40d0def |location=Greensboro, NC |publisher=[[Honda]] |date=February 9, 2007 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>[[Allegiant Air]] began service to [[Orlando Sanford International Airport]] and [[St. Petersburg\u2013Clearwater International Airport]] in late May 2007.\n\nThe airport completed a new 9,000-foot parallel runway in 2010. In 2011 PTI began a renovation project that included new furnishings, automated baggage handling, free wireless internet, charging stations for passenger devices, and interactive kiosks to guide passengers to ground transportation, lodging, and restaurants.\n\nIn July 2017 [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] announced non-stop service to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare International Airport]]. In September 2018 [[Spirit Airlines]] announced service to [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], and [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]].\n\n==Terminals and facilities==\nCompleted in 1982, the terminal building of Piedmont Triad International Airport currently has 26 passenger [[gate (airport)|gates]]: 14 on the north concourse, and 12 on the south concourse. A 2006 expansion added another {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} to the terminal (at a cost of $5 million); a substantial part of this space was used to establish more permanent security checkpoints. Both concourses are the same size, despite the different gate numbers. There are two passenger accessible levels of the terminal. The top includes ticketing, security, boarding, and concession areas. The bottom floor houses baggage claim and ground transportation.\n\nPreviously an US Airways Club, American Airlines operated an Admirals Club across from Gate 45 in the south concourse.  As of October 15, 2018, the Admirals Club permanently closed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://simpleflying.com/american-is-closing-3-admiral-club-lounges-on-october-15th/ |title=American Is Closing 3 Admiral Club Lounges on October 15th |first=Joanna |last=Bailey |date=August 30, 2018 |accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 30, 2019, the airport averages 246 aircraft operations per day: 37% general aviation, 33% air taxi, 28% scheduled commercial, and 2% military.

{"title_page": "Charles Stokes (trader)", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2017}}\n'''Charles Henry Stokes''' ([[Dublin]], 1852 \u2013  [[Lindi]], 1895) was an Irish missionary turned trader who lived much of his life in Africa and was the centre of the [[Stokes Affair]] between the colonial United Kingdom and [[Congo Free State]].\n\n==Life==\nCharles was born in Dublin and went to school in [[Enniskillen]] before his father died when Charles was twenty. When this happened, he went with his mother to [[Liverpool]], where he found work as a clerk for the [[Church Missionary Society]]. He decided to seek new horizons and trained as a lay evangelist with the Society in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. In May 1878 he arrived in [[Zanzibar]]. His first act was to set up a 300-strong vehicle caravan to the Great Lakes, because he wanted to Christianise [[Buganda]]. He was a skilled organizer and increasingly undertook expeditions.\n\nIn January 1883 he married in the Cathedral of Zanzibar with Ellen Sherratt, one of the nurses who were sent to him by the mission. She gave birth to their daughter Ellen Louise in March 1884, but died a week later. The following year Stokes married again, to an African woman named Limi relative of the chief of the Wanyamwesi, a tribe that supplied many of the bearers in his caravans. This was highly unusual at the time. He also had two African concubines, Nanjala and Zaria, with whom he had two children. He was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Protestant]] Church and became a trader around central Africa, selling goods such as ivory.<ref>Nicholas Harman, Bwana Stokesi and his African Conquests, Jonathan Cape, London, 1986</ref>\n\nStokes was on good terms with the Arabo-Swahili and the British, and since 1890 with the [[German East Africa|Germans]], trading with all of them. In 1894 he went for the first time with a large expedition to north-eastern Congo, with thousands of carriers and large quantities of guns and ivory. The Arabo-Swahili who he was trading with were at war with the [[Congo Free State]] at the time and desperately needed weapons.\n\n==Arrest, trial, execution==\nThrough intercepted letters, Captain [[Hubert Lothaire|Hubert-Joseph Lothaire]], the commander of the Belgian forces in the region, learned that Stokes was coming to the Congo to trade weapons.

When this happened, he went with his mother to [[Liverpool]], where he found work as a clerk for the [[Church Missionary Society]]. He decided to seek new horizons and trained as a lay evangelist with the Society in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. In May 1878 he arrived in [[Zanzibar]]. His first act was to set up a 300-strong vehicle caravan to the Great Lakes, because he wanted to Christianise [[Buganda]]. He was a skilled organizer and increasingly undertook expeditions.\n\nIn January 1883 he married in the Cathedral of Zanzibar with Ellen Sherratt, one of the nurses who were sent to him by the mission. She gave birth to their daughter Ellen Louise in March 1884, but died a week later. The following year Stokes married again, to an African woman named Limi relative of the chief of the Wanyamwesi, a tribe that supplied many of the bearers in his caravans. This was highly unusual at the time. He also had two African concubines, Nanjala and Zaria, with whom he had two children. He was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Protestant]] Church and became a trader around central Africa, selling goods such as ivory.<ref>Nicholas Harman, Bwana Stokesi and his African Conquests, Jonathan Cape, London, 1986</ref>\n\nStokes was on good terms with the Arabo-Swahili and the British, and since 1890 with the [[German East Africa|Germans]], trading with all of them. In 1894 he went for the first time with a large expedition to north-eastern Congo, with thousands of carriers and large quantities of guns and ivory. The Arabo-Swahili who he was trading with were at war with the [[Congo Free State]] at the time and desperately needed weapons.\n\n==Arrest, trial, execution==\nThrough intercepted letters, Captain [[Hubert Lothaire|Hubert-Joseph Lothaire]], the commander of the Belgian forces in the region, learned that Stokes was coming to the Congo to trade weapons. He sent Lieutenant Josu\u00e9 Henry with 70 men ahead to capture him. Henry took advantage of the absence of a large part of Stokes' caravan, who were scattered in the forest searching for food, and arrested him in his tent (December 1894). He was taken to Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a [[Drumhead court-martial]].

For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters.
