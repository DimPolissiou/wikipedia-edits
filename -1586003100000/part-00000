Finally on December 14, 1819, Mobile became part of the new 22nd state, [[Alabama]], one of the earlier states of the U.S.  Forty-one years later, Alabama left the Union and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] in 1861.

The area was explored in more detail in 1516 by [[Diego Miruelo|Diego de Miruelo]] and in 1519 by [[Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda]].  In 1528, [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] traveled through what was likely the [[Mobile Bay]] area, encountering Native Americans who fled and burned their towns at the approach of the expedition.

The settlement, then known as [[Old Mobile Site|''Fort Louis de la Louisiane'']], was first established at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. It was founded under the direction of d'Iberville by his brother, [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to establish control over France's Louisiana claims with Bienville having been made governor of French Louisiana in 1701.  Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on 20 July 1703, by [[Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevri\u00e8res de Saint-Vallier]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]].<ref name=\"oldmobile1\">{{harvp|Higginbotham|1977|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> The parish was the first established on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].<ref name=\"oldmobile1\"/>  The year 1704 saw the arrival of 23 women, known to history as \"[[casquette girl]]s\" to the colony aboard the ''P\u00e9lican'', along with [[yellow fever]] introduced to the ship in [[Havana]].<ref name=\"pelican\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>  Though most of the \"casquette girls\" recovered, a large number of the existing colonists and the neighboring Native Americans died from the illness.<ref name=\"pelican\"/> This early period also saw the arrival of the first [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[slaves]] aboard a French supply ship from [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref name=\"pelican\"/> The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708 yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease.<ref name=\"oldmobile1\"/>\n\n[[File:Mobile1725.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Mobile and Fort Cond\u00e9 in 1725.]]\nThese additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]] in 1711. This site had previously been settled five years prior by [[Charles Rochon]], Gilbert Dardenne, Pierre LeB\u0153uf and Claude Parant.<ref>{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=17\u201327}}</ref>  A new earth and palisade ''Fort Louis'' was constructed at the new site during this time.<ref name=MoMfort>\"Other Locations: Historic Fort Conde\" (history), Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006, webpage:[http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php MoM-Other]</ref>  The colony was an economic loss, so in 1712, [[Antoine Crozat]] took over administration of the colony by royal charter for 15 years, pledging a share of profits to the King.<ref name=EA/> The colony boasted a population of 400 persons.

Bienville again took the helm as governor, serving the office for less than a year until the new governor, [[Jean-Michel de Lepinay]], arrived from France.<ref name=\"cadillac\"/> Lepinay, however, did not last long either, due to Crozat's relinquishing control of the colony in 1717 (after just 5 of the 15 years). The administration shifted to [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] and his [[Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes|Company of the Indies]].<ref name=\"cadillac\"/> Bienville found himself once again governor of Louisiana. In 1719, France warred with Spain, and Mobile was on the battlefront, so Bienville decided to move the capital to [[Old Biloxi]], further west.<ref name=EA/><ref name=cadillac/>\n\nThe capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] was moved to [[Biloxi]], (now in [[Mississippi]]) in 1720,<ref name=MoMfort/> leaving Mobile relegated to the role of military and trading outpost.

The British renamed [[Fort Conde|Fort Cond\u00e9]] as [[Fort Charlotte (Mobile)|Fort Charlotte]] after the [[queen consort]] and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, [[naval stores]], indigo, hides, rice, pecans, and cattle.\n\n===Spanish West Florida: 1780 to 1812===\nThe Spanish captured Mobile during the [[American Revolutionary War]] during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]]  in 1780, and retained Mobile by the terms of the war-ending [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.  Mobile was then part of the colonial province [[Spanish West Florida|''Florida Occidental'']] for thirty years, controlled from [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] until 1813 when it was captured by American forces (during the [[War of 1812]]) under [[James Wilkinson]].\n\n===Republic of West Florida===\nThe United States and Spain held long, inconclusive negotiations on [[West Florida Controversy|the status of West Florida]]. In the meantime, American settlers, including [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], had established a foothold in the area and resisted [[Spanish West Florida|Spanish]] control, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for three months of the [[Republic of West Florida]]. On September 23, 1810, after meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and unfurled the [[Bonnie Blue Flag]].  The Republic of West Florida claimed boundaries that included all territory south of the [[31st parallel north|31st parallel]], west of the [[Perdido River]], and east of the [[Mississippi River]], not including any territory that had been part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\nSpain retained its control of the [[Mobile District]] for a few more years, while the [[United States]] seized the former [[Baton Rouge District]] in December 1810.\n\n==Territorial period==\n\n===Mississippi Territory: 1813 to 1817===\n[[File:Mobile 1815.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile in 1815.]]\nBefore the [[War of 1812]], the Spaniards in Mobile allowed British merchants to sell arms and supplies to the Indians to harass Americans who had begun to settle parts of present-day Alabama. During the course of the war, General [[James Wilkinson]] took a force of American troops from New Orleans to capture Mobile. The Spanish capitulated in April 1813 and the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] of the United States was raised for the first time over the Mobile area as it was added to the existing [[Mississippi Territory]].<ref name=\"al-archives\">{{cite web\n  | title=''Stars and Stripes Raised in Mobile''\n  | work=Archives.state.al.us\n  | url=http://archives.state.al.us/brnzdrs/4.html\n  | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>\n\nA British attempt commanded by Captain [[William Henry Percy|Henry Percy]] in September 1814 to take [[Fort Bowyer]] on Mobile Bay was repulsed by American forces.\n\n===Alabama Territory: 1817 to 1819===\nWithin 4 years, in March 1817, the U.S. state of [[Mississippi]] was formed, splitting the [[Mississippi Territory]] in half, and leaving Mobile, for the next 2 years, as part of the new [[Alabama Territory]].  In 1819, after two years as a territory, the US state of [[Alabama]] was formed, converting the [[Alabama Territory]] into a full American state.\n\n==After statehood==\n\n===Antebellum:1820 to 1860===\n[[File:Map of Mobile in 1838.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile in 1838.]]\nThe cotton boom of the early 19th century brought an explosion of commerce to what had been a sleepy frontier town. For almost the next half century, Mobile enjoyed prosperity as the second largest international seaport on the [[Gulf Coast]], after [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Progress was based upon cotton, shipped downriver by [[flatboat]] or [[steamboat]] from plantation slave fields in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]].<ref name=\"ushistory.com\">{{cite web|title=''Mobile, Alabama''|work=US-History.com|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2255.html|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> A fire in October 1827 destroyed most of the old city from the [[Mobile River]] to Saint Emanuel Street and from Saint Francis to [[Government Street (Mobile, Alabama)|Government Street]].<ref name=\"newhistory1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|p=67}}</ref>   The city experienced another fire in 1839 that burned part of city between Conti and Government Street from Royal to Saint Emanuel Street and also both sides of Dauphin to Franklin Street.<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/>  Despite these setbacks, Mobile was one of the four busiest ports in the US by the 1850s. The wealth created by this trade brought the city to a cultural high point. Mobile became known throughout the country and the world.\n\nIn another note of differentiation between the somewhat cosmopolitan port and the hinterlands of predominantly Protestant Alabama, Mobile was declared a [[diocese]] of the Roman Catholic Church in this same period. What would become known as [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School]] was also established during this time. In 1830, Bishop [[Michael Portier]] founded [[Spring Hill College]], one of the oldest Catholic schools in the country.  Control of the college was assumed by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] in 1847.\n\nIn 1860, the ''[[Clotilde (slave ship)|Clotilde]]''<!--Also documented as Clotilda-->, the last known ship to arrive in the Americas with a cargo of slaves, was abandoned by its captain near Mobile.  A number of these slaves later formed their own community on the banks of the Mobile River after the [[American Civil War]], which became known as [[Africatown]]. The inhabitants of this community retained their African customs and language well into the 20th century.\n\n===Civil War: 1861 to 1865===\n[[File:Battle of Mobile Bay map.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile Bay and surroundings during the American Civil War.]]\n{{main|Mobile, Alabama, in the Civil War}}\nMobile grew substantially in the period leading up to the Civil War, when the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a [[blockade]] under the command of [[Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining a trickle of trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the [[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]], the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile.\n\nIn August 1864 Farragut's ships fought their way past [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]] and [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] guarding the mouth of Mobile Bay and defeated a small force of wooden Confederate gunboats and the ironclad {{ship|CSS|Tennessee}}, in the famous [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. It is here that Farragut is alleged to have uttered his famous \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\" quote after the {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|6}} hit a Confederate mine and sank. The ''Tecumseh'' rests in Mobile Bay to this day. The city of Mobile later surrendered to the Union army in order to avoid destruction. Ironically, on May 25, 1865, weeks after [[Jefferson Davis]] had dissolved the Confederacy, an ammunition depot explosion, termed the great [[Mobile magazine explosion]], killed some 300 people and destroyed a significant portion of the city.\n\n===Post war: 1866 to 1899===\nThe aftermath of the war left Mobile with a spirit of governmental and economic caution that would limit it for a large part of the next century.<ref name=\"reconstruction1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|p=153}}</ref>  The last quarter of the 19th century in Mobile was a time of turmoil.  The government was controlled by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was instituted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in May 1867.  Many of these politicians instituted policies that  caused the disenfranchised [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to become embittered.  In 1874, Democrats around the state used violence and extreme measures to keep African Americans and non-Democratic voters from participating in the November election.  Election day in Mobile saw armed gangs roaming the streets and mobs of people surrounding the polling places to scare any non-Democrats away.<ref name=\"postwar\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=127\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the city continued under the Democrats. By 1875 the city was more than $5 million in debt and could not even pay the interest on the loans.  This debt had been accruing since the 1830s.  A game of political maneuvering continued to be played between rival factions as the city bordered on bankruptcy.  In 1879 the city charter was repealed by the state legislature, abolishing the \"City of Mobile\" and replacing it with three city commissioners appointed by the Alabama governor.  The commissioners were charged with governing the new \"Port of Mobile\" and reducing the city's debt.  The debt problem would not be settled until the last note was paid in 1906.<ref name=\"postwar\"/>\n\n==Modern period==\n\n===Early 20th century: 1900 to 1949===\nThe turn of the 20th century saw Mobile's population increase from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920.<ref name=\"progress1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=154\u2013169}}</ref>  During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements, which drastically deepened the shipping channels in the harbor.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  During and after World War I manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important.   In 1902 the city government passed Mobile's first [[racial segregation|segregation]] ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  Mobile's African American population responded to this with a two-month boycott which was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  After this, Mobile's de facto segregation would increasingly be replaced with legislated segregation.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>\n\n[[File:Mobile1909.jpg|thumb|800px|center| The Mobile skyline in 1909.]]\nWorld War II led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the [[Brookley Air Force Base|Brookley Army Air Field]].<ref name=\"thomason2\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=213\u2013217}}</ref>  Between 1940 and 1943, over 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing [[Liberty ships]] at its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] to support the war effort by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  [[Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation]], a subsidiary of [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]], focused on building [[Cargo ship|freighters]], {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|1}}s, and [[minesweeper]]s.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  The US Army bought the municipal airport, Bates Field, and there developed the Brookley Army Air Field, later to become the Brookley Air Force Base. Brookley quickly became the area's largest employer. In the mid-1960s the Air Force Base was closed due to a Department of Defense \"base realignment\" and the airport returned to the city. Today, it is an aerospace and industrial site known as the [[Brookley Aeroplex]].\n\n[[File:1919 map Mobile, Alabama Automobile Blue Book,.jpg|thumb|Map of Mobile in 1919]]\n\nDuring the war, the phenomenal influx of workers created a huge housing shortage. Citizens rented out extra rooms and also converted porches, garages and even chicken coops into rentals. Several federal housing projects were quickly built to house the new maritime and Air Force workers. Several of these are still to be found, notably the community of Birdville. \"Thomas James Place\" was the proper name for Birdville which was built just outside Brookley Air Force Base to provide relief for the housing shortage. The development consisted of a series of interwoven curving concrete streets named after various birds, hence the nickname Birdville.\n\n===Late 20th century: 1950 to 1999===\nBy 1956, Mobile's square mileage had tripled to accommodate growth. The Brookley Air Force Base closure in the mid-1960s sent economic tremors through the area which took many years to absorb. Also in the post-war period, the [[pulp and paper industry]] became a major industry in Mobile. [[Scott Paper Company]] and [[International Paper]] combined to become one of the area's largest workforces.\n\nLegal racial segregation was ended by congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Mobile had been more tolerant and racially accommodating than many other [[Southern United States|Southern]] cities, with the police force and one local college becoming integrated in the 1950s and the voluntary desegregation of buses and lunchcounters by 1963, but schools and many other institutions had remained segregated.  In 1963, three African-American students filed a suit against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to [[Murphy High School (Alabama)|Murphy High School]]. The federal district court ordered that they be admitted for the 1964 school year, as it had been ten years since the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"murphy1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=7260\u2013261}}</ref> In 1964, the [[University of South Alabama]] opened as an integrated college, planned as such from its inception in 1956.\n\nMobile's city government was changed in 1985 from three city commissioners elected [[at-large]] to a mayor and city-council form with seven members elected from single-member districts, following a court challenge by  African-American residents. In ''Bolden v. City of Mobile'' the federal district court ruled that the city commission form was discriminatory in intent, with the result of substantially diluting the African-American vote. In the years after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], African Americans had not been able to elect any candidates of their choice to the city commission.<ref name=\"gov1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=271\u2013275}}</ref>\n\n[[Racial equality]] and justice continued to be an issue on the individual level in Mobile.<ref name=gov1/> In 1981, [[Michael Donald]] was abducted and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members on Herndon Avenue.<ref name=gov1/>  The two perpetrators were both convicted of murder, with one sentenced to life in prison and the other sentenced to death and executed in 1997.  A subsequent wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] on behalf of Michael Donald's mother against the [[United Klans of America]].

Finally on December 14, 1819, Mobile became part of the new 22nd state, [[Alabama]], one of the earlier states of the U.S.  Forty-one years later, Alabama left the Union and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] in 1861.

The area was explored in more detail in 1516 by [[Diego Miruelo|Diego de Miruelo]] and in 1519 by [[Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda]].  In 1528, [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] traveled through what was likely the [[Mobile Bay]] area, encountering Native Americans who fled and burned their towns at the approach of the expedition.

The settlement, then known as [[Old Mobile Site|''Fort Louis de la Louisiane'']], was first established at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. It was founded under the direction of d'Iberville by his brother, [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to establish control over France's Louisiana claims with Bienville having been made governor of French Louisiana in 1701.  Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on 20 July 1703, by [[Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevri\u00e8res de Saint-Vallier]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]].<ref name=\"oldmobile1\">{{harvp|Higginbotham|1977|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> The parish was the first established on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].<ref name=\"oldmobile1\"/>  The year 1704 saw the arrival of 23 women, known to history as \"[[casquette girl]]s\" to the colony aboard the ''P\u00e9lican'', along with [[yellow fever]] introduced to the ship in [[Havana]].<ref name=\"pelican\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>  Though most of the \"casquette girls\" recovered, a large number of the existing colonists and the neighboring Native Americans died from the illness.<ref name=\"pelican\"/> This early period also saw the arrival of the first [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[slaves]] aboard a French supply ship from [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref name=\"pelican\"/> The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708 yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease.<ref name=\"oldmobile1\"/>\n\n[[File:Mobile1725.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Mobile and Fort Cond\u00e9 in 1725.]]\nThese additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]] in 1711.

The British renamed [[Fort Conde|Fort Cond\u00e9]] as [[Fort Charlotte (Mobile)|Fort Charlotte]] after the [[queen consort]] and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, [[naval stores]], indigo, hides, rice, pecans, and cattle.\n\n===Spanish West Florida: 1780 to 1812===\nThe Spanish captured Mobile during the [[American Revolutionary War]] during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]]  in 1780, and retained Mobile by the terms of the war-ending [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.  Mobile was then part of the colonial province [[Spanish West Florida|''Florida Occidental'']] for thirty years, controlled from [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] until 1813 when it was captured by American forces (during the [[War of 1812]]) under [[James Wilkinson]].\n\n===Republic of West Florida===\nThe United States and Spain held long, inconclusive negotiations on [[West Florida Controversy|the status of West Florida]]. In the meantime, American settlers, including [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], had established a foothold in the area and resisted [[Spanish West Florida|Spanish]] control, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for three months of the [[Republic of West Florida]]. On September 23, 1810, after meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and unfurled the [[Bonnie Blue Flag]].  The Republic of West Florida claimed boundaries that included all territory south of the [[31st parallel north|31st parallel]], west of the [[Perdido River]], and east of the [[Mississippi River]], not including any territory that had been part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\nSpain retained its control of the [[Mobile District]] for a few more years, while the [[United States]] seized the former [[Baton Rouge District]] in December 1810.\n\n==Territorial period==\n\n===Mississippi Territory: 1813 to 1817===\n[[File:Mobile 1815.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile in 1815.]]\nBefore the [[War of 1812]], the Spaniards in Mobile allowed British merchants to sell arms and supplies to the Indians to harass Americans who had begun to settle parts of present-day Alabama. During the course of the war, General [[James Wilkinson]] took a force of American troops from New Orleans to capture Mobile. The Spanish capitulated in April 1813 and the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] of the United States was raised for the first time over the Mobile area as it was added to the existing [[Mississippi Territory]].<ref name=\"al-archives\">{{cite web\n  | title=''Stars and Stripes Raised in Mobile''\n  | work=Archives.state.al.us\n  | url=http://archives.state.al.us/brnzdrs/4.html\n  | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>\n\nA British attempt commanded by Captain [[William Henry Percy|Henry Percy]] in September 1814 to take [[Fort Bowyer]] on Mobile Bay was repulsed by American forces.\n\n===Alabama Territory: 1817 to 1819===\nWithin 4 years, in March 1817, the U.S. state of [[Mississippi]] was formed, splitting the [[Mississippi Territory]] in half, and leaving Mobile, for the next 2 years, as part of the new [[Alabama Territory]].  In 1819, after two years as a territory, the US state of [[Alabama]] was formed, converting the [[Alabama Territory]] into a full American state.\n\n==After statehood==\n\n===Antebellum:1820 to 1860===\n[[File:Map of Mobile in 1838.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile in 1838.]]\nThe cotton boom of the early 19th century brought an explosion of commerce to what had been a sleepy frontier town. For almost the next half century, Mobile enjoyed prosperity as the second largest international seaport on the [[Gulf Coast]], after [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Progress was based upon cotton, shipped downriver by [[flatboat]] or [[steamboat]] from plantation slave fields in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]].<ref name=\"ushistory.com\">{{cite web|title=''Mobile, Alabama''|work=US-History.com|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2255.html|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> A fire in October 1827 destroyed most of the old city from the [[Mobile River]] to Saint Emanuel Street and from Saint Francis to [[Government Street (Mobile, Alabama)|Government Street]].<ref name=\"newhistory1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|p=67}}</ref>   The city experienced another fire in 1839 that burned part of city between Conti and Government Street from Royal to Saint Emanuel Street and also both sides of Dauphin to Franklin Street.<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/>  Despite these setbacks, Mobile was one of the four busiest ports in the US by the 1850s. The wealth created by this trade brought the city to a cultural high point. Mobile became known throughout the country and the world.\n\nIn another note of differentiation between the somewhat cosmopolitan port and the hinterlands of predominantly Protestant Alabama, Mobile was declared a [[diocese]] of the Roman Catholic Church in this same period. What would become known as [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School]] was also established during this time. In 1830, Bishop [[Michael Portier]] founded [[Spring Hill College]], one of the oldest Catholic schools in the country.  Control of the college was assumed by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] in 1847.\n\nIn 1860, the ''[[Clotilde (slave ship)|Clotilde]]''<!--Also documented as Clotilda-->, the last known ship to arrive in the Americas with a cargo of slaves, was abandoned by its captain near Mobile.  A number of these slaves later formed their own community on the banks of the Mobile River after the [[American Civil War]], which became known as [[Africatown]]. The inhabitants of this community retained their African customs and language well into the 20th century.\n\n===Civil War: 1861 to 1865===\n[[File:Battle of Mobile Bay map.jpg|thumb|280px|A map of Mobile Bay and surroundings during the American Civil War.]]\n{{main|Mobile, Alabama, in the Civil War}}\nMobile grew substantially in the period leading up to the Civil War, when the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a [[blockade]] under the command of [[Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining a trickle of trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the [[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]], the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile.\n\nIn August 1864 Farragut's ships fought their way past [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]] and [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] guarding the mouth of Mobile Bay and defeated a small force of wooden Confederate gunboats and the ironclad {{ship|CSS|Tennessee}}, in the famous [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. It is here that Farragut is alleged to have uttered his famous \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\" quote after the {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|6}} hit a Confederate mine and sank. The ''Tecumseh'' rests in Mobile Bay to this day. The city of Mobile later surrendered to the Union army in order to avoid destruction. Ironically, on May 25, 1865, weeks after [[Jefferson Davis]] had dissolved the Confederacy, an ammunition depot explosion, termed the great [[Mobile magazine explosion]], killed some 300 people and destroyed a significant portion of the city.\n\n===Post war: 1866 to 1899===\nThe aftermath of the war left Mobile with a spirit of governmental and economic caution that would limit it for a large part of the next century.<ref name=\"reconstruction1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|p=153}}</ref>  The last quarter of the 19th century in Mobile was a time of turmoil.  The government was controlled by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was instituted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in May 1867.  Many of these politicians instituted policies that  caused the disenfranchised [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to become embittered.  In 1874, Democrats around the state used violence and extreme measures to keep African Americans and non-Democratic voters from participating in the November election.  Election day in Mobile saw armed gangs roaming the streets and mobs of people surrounding the polling places to scare any non-Democrats away.<ref name=\"postwar\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=127\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the city continued under the Democrats. By 1875 the city was more than $5 million in debt and could not even pay the interest on the loans.  This debt had been accruing since the 1830s.  A game of political maneuvering continued to be played between rival factions as the city bordered on bankruptcy.  In 1879 the city charter was repealed by the state legislature, abolishing the \"City of Mobile\" and replacing it with three city commissioners appointed by the Alabama governor.  The commissioners were charged with governing the new \"Port of Mobile\" and reducing the city's debt.  The debt problem would not be settled until the last note was paid in 1906.<ref name=\"postwar\"/>\n\n==Modern period==\n\n===Early 20th century: 1900 to 1949===\nThe turn of the 20th century saw Mobile's population increase from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920.<ref name=\"progress1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=154\u2013169}}</ref>  During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements, which drastically deepened the shipping channels in the harbor.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  During and after World War I manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important.   In 1902 the city government passed Mobile's first [[racial segregation|segregation]] ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  Mobile's African American population responded to this with a two-month boycott which was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>  After this, Mobile's de facto segregation would increasingly be replaced with legislated segregation.<ref name=\"progress1\"/>\n\n[[File:Mobile1909.jpg|thumb|800px|center| The Mobile skyline in 1909.]]\nWorld War II led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the [[Brookley Air Force Base|Brookley Army Air Field]].<ref name=\"thomason2\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=213\u2013217}}</ref>  Between 1940 and 1943, over 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing [[Liberty ships]] at its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] to support the war effort by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  [[Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation]], a subsidiary of [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]], focused on building [[Cargo ship|freighters]], {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|1}}s, and [[minesweeper]]s.<ref name=\"thomason2\"/>  The US Army bought the municipal airport, Bates Field, and there developed the Brookley Army Air Field, later to become the Brookley Air Force Base. Brookley quickly became the area's largest employer. In the mid-1960s the Air Force Base was closed due to a Department of Defense \"base realignment\" and the airport returned to the city. Today, it is an aerospace and industrial site known as the [[Brookley Aeroplex]].\n\n[[File:1919 map Mobile, Alabama Automobile Blue Book,.jpg|thumb|Map of Mobile in 1919]]\n\nDuring the war, the phenomenal influx of workers created a huge housing shortage. Citizens rented out extra rooms and also converted porches, garages and even chicken coops into rentals. Several federal housing projects were quickly built to house the new maritime and Air Force workers. Several of these are still to be found, notably the community of Birdville. \"Thomas James Place\" was the proper name for Birdville which was built just outside Brookley Air Force Base to provide relief for the housing shortage. The development consisted of a series of interwoven curving concrete streets named after various birds, hence the nickname Birdville.\n\n===Late 20th century: 1950 to 1999===\nBy 1956, Mobile's square mileage had tripled to accommodate growth. The Brookley Air Force Base closure in the mid-1960s sent economic tremors through the area which took many years to absorb. Also in the post-war period, the [[pulp and paper industry]] became a major industry in Mobile. [[Scott Paper Company]] and [[International Paper]] combined to become one of the area's largest workforces.\n\nLegal racial segregation was ended by congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Mobile had been more tolerant and racially accommodating than many other [[Southern United States|Southern]] cities, with the police force and one local college becoming integrated in the 1950s and the voluntary desegregation of buses and lunchcounters by 1963, but schools and many other institutions had remained segregated.  In 1963, three African-American students filed a suit against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to [[Murphy High School (Alabama)|Murphy High School]]. The federal district court ordered that they be admitted for the 1964 school year, as it had been ten years since the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"murphy1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=7260\u2013261}}</ref> In 1964, the [[University of South Alabama]] opened as an integrated college, planned as such from its inception in 1956.\n\nMobile's city government was changed in 1985 from three city commissioners elected [[at-large]] to a mayor and city-council form with seven members elected from single-member districts, following a court challenge by  African-American residents. In ''Bolden v. City of Mobile'' the federal district court ruled that the city commission form was discriminatory in intent, with the result of substantially diluting the African-American vote. In the years after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], African Americans had not been able to elect any candidates of their choice to the city commission.<ref name=\"gov1\">{{harvp|Thomason|2001|pp=271\u2013275}}</ref>\n\n[[Racial equality]] and justice continued to be an issue on the individual level in Mobile.<ref name=gov1/> In 1981, [[Michael Donald]] was abducted and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members on Herndon Avenue.<ref name=gov1/>  The two perpetrators were both convicted of murder, with one sentenced to life in prison and the other sentenced to death and executed in 1997.  A subsequent wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] on behalf of Michael Donald's mother against the [[United Klans of America]]. The seven million dollar decision against the Klans\u2014returned, notably, by an [[all-white jury]]\u2014effectively put the Ku Klux Klan out of business in Alabama.<ref name=gov1/>  A fatal police shooting of an African-American man in 1992 sparked violence and unrest in Mobile, leading to the formation of a Human Relations Commission by the city in 1994.<ref name=gov1/>\n\n[[Hurricane Frederic]], which struck the area on September 12, 1979, caused severe damage in Mobile.  Many residents were without power, water, telephone and basic necessities for weeks, but only one death was recorded.  Relief funding following Frederic provided an economic boom in addition to growth in the 1980s, vastly improving Mobile's overall economic picture.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the city council and mayor Mike Dow began an effort termed the \"String of Pearls Initiative\" to make Mobile into a competitive, urban city.<ref name=\"progress2\">{{cite web|title=Mobile W Title of All American City|work=City of Mobile|url=http://www.cityofmobile.org/mapsnfacts/all_america.php|accessdate=2007-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017135508/http://cityofmobile.org/mapsnfacts/all_america.php|archive-date=2007-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Numerous new facilities and projects were built around the city; the government encouraged the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes.<ref name=\"progress2\"/>  Violent crime was reduced by 50%, and the city and county leaders worked to attract new business ventures to the area.<ref name=\"progress3\">{{cite web|title=\"2005 State of the City\" \"|work=City of Mobile|url=http://www.cityofmobile.org/news.php?view=full&news=679|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>  The effort continues into the present with new city government leadership.<ref name=\"progress3\"/>\n\nShipbuilding began to make a major comeback in Mobile with the founding in 1999 of [[Austal USA]], a joint venture of Australian shipbuilder, [[Austal Ships|Austal]], and Bender Shipbuilding.<ref name=\"colton1\">{{cite web|title=Austal USA, Mobile AL Construction Record|work=The Colton Company|url=http://www.coltoncompany.com/shipbldg/ussbldrs/postwwii/shipyards/active/aluminum/austal.htm|accessdate=2007-11-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017213332/http://coltoncompany.com/shipbldg/ussbldrs/postwwii/shipyards/active/aluminum/austal.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===21st century: 2000 to present===\n[[File:Mobile Skyline.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mobile skyline in 2007.]]\nMobile received moderate damage from [[Hurricane Ivan]] on 16 September 2004.<ref name=\"HurIvan\">{{cite web|title= Powerful Hurricane Ivan Slams the IS Central Gulf Coast as an Upper Category-3 Storm|work=National Weather Service Forecast Office Mobile/Pensacola|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mob/ivan_page/Ivan-main.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923085158/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mob/ivan_page/Ivan-main.htm |archivedate=2004-09-23}}</ref>  Mobile received damage again from [[Hurricane Katrina]] on 29 August 2005.
