Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

It had cost US$13 million to produce.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bedell |first=Sally |date=4 May 1983 |title=\"V\" series an NBC hit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/04/movies/v-series-an-nbc-hit.html |work=[[New York Times]] |location= |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref> It was followed in 1984 by a three-part miniseries, ''[[V (The Final Battle)|V: The Final Battle]]'', and a nineteen-episode weekly television series, ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''V: The Series'') during the 1984\u201385 television season. ABC ran a remake known as '''''[[V (2009 TV series)|V: The 2009 TV series]]''''' which ran for two seasons for 22 episodes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the original series the title refers to the [[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory-freedom sign|\"V for Victory\" sign]]. In the 1983 ''V'' miniseries, a group of children are shown spray painting generic graffiti over the Visitors' propaganda posters, but are then shown how to spray the V over the posters by Abraham Bernstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, who explains the meaning of the sign to them as he defaces the first poster. In the 2009 reboot of the series, however, ''V'' is used within the show as an abbreviation for the Visitors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | title=\"V\" IS FOR VICTORY, NOT FOR VISITORS! | publisher=visitorsamongus.com | accessdate=2011-01-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105103304/http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | archivedate=2011-01-05 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=V is for Visitors \u2014 and Victory | url=http://www.tvtyrant.com/2009/08/11/v-is-for-visitors-%E2%80%94-and-victory/ | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/14021/ | title=Lost\u2019s Elizabeth Mitchell Fights Aliens in V Reboot | work=Wired.com | date=2009-08-11 | accessdate=2011-01-22 | quote='Propaganda has just become advertising' in modern society, [2009 series producer Jeffrey] Bell said.

Johnson's novel ''[[V (The Second Generation)|V: The Second Generation]]'', an alternative sequel to the first miniseries which disregards ''V: The Final Battle'' and ''V: The Series'', (because of his non-involvement with them) was released on February 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html |title=V History |publisher=Kennethjohnson.us |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Johnson stated he was in negotiations for a TV adaptation of his sequel novel, but in October 2008, [[Warner Bros. Television]] announced they were producing a complete [[remake]] of ''V'' instead.  This [[V (2009 TV series)|new ''V'' series]] ran for two truncated seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], from November 3, 2009, to March 15, 2011.\n\n==Television==\n* ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'' miniseries (1983)\n* ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]'' sequel miniseries (1984)\n* ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' ongoing series (1984\u20131985)\n* ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'' reboot series (2009\u20132011)\n\nThe original miniseries debuted in the United States on [[NBC]] on May 1, 1983. Series creator Kenneth Johnson has said that the story was inspired by the 1935 novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]].<ref>Copp, Dan. Fascist Lizards from Outer Space: The Politics, Literary Influences and Cultural History of Kenneth Johnson\u2019s V. McFarland, 2017, page 21.</ref> In a commentary track on the [[DVD]] release of the first miniseries, Johnson reveals that ''V'' was originally intended as a straightforward political thriller, charting the rise of a fascist movement in the United States. NBC was interested in a sci-fi hit, to capitalize on the success of films such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy.\n\nThe miniseries was successful enough to spawn a sequel, ''V: The Final Battle'', which was meant to conclude the story, and also a television series in 1984\u20131985 that continued it. Johnson left the franchise during production of ''The Final Battle''. The cancellation of the TV series in the spring of 1985 meant that the season ends with a cliffhanger. The TV series' single season was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004. The series was remade in 2009.\n\n==Film==\nOn February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of ''V''. The film would be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless\u2014and timely\u2014story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st Century&nbsp;... V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V History|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> Johnson later updated his site to say that Desilu's option has expired,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V News|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> and referred to allegations that the individual helming the new Desilu was defrauding investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-alleges-man-used-lucille-balls-old-studio-trick-investors-1156709|title=CBS Alleges Man Used Lucille Ball's Old Studio to Trick Investors|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date= October 31, 2018 |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\n===Original series===\n''V'' spun off a series of original novels. Five were originally planned but the range soon extended beyond these. The first was a novelization of the first two miniseries combined into one story, originally planned as 2 books, Pinnacle later changed their minds during its writing, and decreed that it should be one book (The publishers were then left with the option of another book, this became ''East Coast Crisis'')  Because the Writers guide was not ready in time for the authors to consult, most of the original novels that followed did not feature characters or continuing storylines from the TV series, but rather focused on battles against the alien invaders in other parts of the world, some were also set during the \"unrecorded year\" between the end of \"The Final Battle\" and \"Liberation day\" to get around this problem.\n\nWhile the series was on the air, new novels were published once a month by [[Pinnacle Paperbacks]], and in the U.K. every 2 months by [[New English Library]].  In 1987\u201388, the remaining 5 books, left unpublished with the demise of Pinnacle books, were published by Tor. No U.K. publisher was found for these.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Num.\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| &nbsp; Title\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Author\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Published\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| ISBN\n{{Episode list |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title        = V\n |WrittenBy    = [[Ann C.

Prior to this event, High Captain Gerald manages to finally storm the resistance, but with little success, as they were currently liberating the Chicago Art Museum, the Visitors' ground base. Seconds before the commander of the Chicago Mothership, Alicia, calls him back for withdrawal (after the Red Dust is deployed worldwide), he is able to distribute anti-toxin from the resistance base into his shock troopers. Though Alicia is frustrated at her subordinate, she gives him a chance to redeem himself, which Gerald jumps at, as unknowingly to Alicia, Gerald is a double agent.

The [[editing|editor]] of the comic reported at one point in the letter ([[fan mail]]) column that DC was working to acquire permission to continue the [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] of the television series should it not be renewed for a second season.  In the end, either such permission was denied or DC decided not to pursue the matter further. The cover of the 18th issue did state \"Final Issue\", but actually featured (with issue 17) a flashback story featuring Elias Taylor.

It had cost US$13 million to produce.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bedell |first=Sally |date=4 May 1983 |title=\"V\" series an NBC hit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/04/movies/v-series-an-nbc-hit.html |work=[[New York Times]] |location= |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref> It was followed in 1984 by a three-part miniseries, ''[[V (The Final Battle)|V: The Final Battle]]'', and a nineteen-episode weekly television series, ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''V: The Series'') during the 1984\u201385 television season. ABC ran a remake known as '''''[[V (2009 TV series)|V: The 2009 TV series]]''''' which ran for two seasons for 22 episodes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the original series the title refers to the [[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory-freedom sign|\"V for Victory\" sign]]. In the 1983 ''V'' miniseries, a group of children are shown spray painting generic graffiti over the Visitors' propaganda posters, but are then shown how to spray the V over the posters by Abraham Bernstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, who explains the meaning of the sign to them as he defaces the first poster. In the 2009 reboot of the series, however, ''V'' is used within the show as an abbreviation for the Visitors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | title=\"V\" IS FOR VICTORY, NOT FOR VISITORS! | publisher=visitorsamongus.com | accessdate=2011-01-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105103304/http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | archivedate=2011-01-05 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=V is for Visitors \u2014 and Victory | url=http://www.tvtyrant.com/2009/08/11/v-is-for-visitors-%E2%80%94-and-victory/ | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/14021/ | title=Lost\u2019s Elizabeth Mitchell Fights Aliens in V Reboot | work=Wired.com | date=2009-08-11 | accessdate=2011-01-22 | quote='Propaganda has just become advertising' in modern society, [2009 series producer Jeffrey] Bell said.

Johnson's novel ''[[V (The Second Generation)|V: The Second Generation]]'', an alternative sequel to the first miniseries which disregards ''V: The Final Battle'' and ''V: The Series'', (because of his non-involvement with them) was released on February 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html |title=V History |publisher=Kennethjohnson.us |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Johnson stated he was in negotiations for a TV adaptation of his sequel novel, but in October 2008, [[Warner Bros. Television]] announced they were producing a complete [[remake]] of ''V'' instead.  This [[V (2009 TV series)|new ''V'' series]] ran for two truncated seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], from November 3, 2009, to March 15, 2011.\n\n==Television==\n* ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'' miniseries (1983)\n* ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]'' sequel miniseries (1984)\n* ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' ongoing series (1984\u20131985)\n* ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'' reboot series (2009\u20132011)\n\nThe original miniseries debuted in the United States on [[NBC]] on May 1, 1983. Series creator Kenneth Johnson has said that the story was inspired by the 1935 novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]].<ref>Copp, Dan. Fascist Lizards from Outer Space: The Politics, Literary Influences and Cultural History of Kenneth Johnson\u2019s V. McFarland, 2017, page 21.</ref> In a commentary track on the [[DVD]] release of the first miniseries, Johnson reveals that ''V'' was originally intended as a straightforward political thriller, charting the rise of a fascist movement in the United States. NBC was interested in a sci-fi hit, to capitalize on the success of films such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy.\n\nThe miniseries was successful enough to spawn a sequel, ''V: The Final Battle'', which was meant to conclude the story, and also a television series in 1984\u20131985 that continued it. Johnson left the franchise during production of ''The Final Battle''. The cancellation of the TV series in the spring of 1985 meant that the season ends with a cliffhanger. The TV series' single season was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004. The series was remade in 2009.\n\n==Film==\nOn February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of ''V''. The film would be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless\u2014and timely\u2014story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st Century...V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V History|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> Johnson later updated his site to say that Desilu's option has expired,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V News|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> and referred to allegations that the individual helming the new Desilu was defrauding investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-alleges-man-used-lucille-balls-old-studio-trick-investors-1156709|title=CBS Alleges Man Used Lucille Ball's Old Studio to Trick Investors|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date= October 31, 2018 |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\n===Original series===\n''V'' spun off a series of original novels. Five were originally planned but the range soon extended beyond these. The first was a novelization of the first two miniseries combined into one story, originally planned as 2 books, Pinnacle later changed their minds during its writing, and decreed that it should be one book (The publishers were then left with the option of another book, this became ''East Coast Crisis'')  Because the Writers guide was not ready in time for the authors to consult, most of the original novels that followed did not feature characters or continuing storylines from the TV series, but rather focused on battles against the alien invaders in other parts of the world, some were also set during the \"unrecorded year\" between the end of \"The Final Battle\" and \"Liberation day\" to get around this problem.\n\nWhile the series was on the air, new novels were published once a month by [[Pinnacle Paperbacks]], and in the U.K. every 2 months by [[New English Library]].  In 1987\u201388, the remaining 5 books, left unpublished with the demise of Pinnacle books, were published by Tor. No U.K. publisher was found for these.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Num.\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| &nbsp; Title\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Author\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Published\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| ISBN\n{{Episode list |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title        = V\n |WrittenBy    = [[Ann C.

He was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 1986 for service to Australian folklore and music, and became a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] in 1992 for service to the Arts, particularly in the collection and preservation of Australian folklore.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nA pioneer collector of Australian folk music and song, John Meredith was born in [[Holbrook, New South Wales]], to Bert and Ellen Meredith.<ref>''Real Folk'', Meredith, J., Canberra: National Library of Australia, 1995</ref> Bert played the button (bush) accordion, often playing dance tunes for his family after dinner. Bert Meredith worked as a drover along the Darling and Murrumbidgee rivers in NSW and was often away.  His father played the button accordion, an old and much patched Mezon Grand Organ model he probably learned to play whilst away droving and when he was at home he played the popular songs and dances of the Bush.<ref>Bush Music Club: John Meredith, The Bush Music Club & The Australian Folk Song Revival (1950s), http://www.bushmusic.org.au/JM_Tribute.shtml</ref> He also played the mouth organ, using a tin pannikin as a resonator or playing the bones as he played on mouth organ. He died when John was only nine years old, but many of his tunes stayed in John's mind.\n\nEllen looked after John and six more on a small block in Holbrook and he remembers that she sang a little as she worked and she entertained the kids with readings from Australian books and magazines such as [[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]. Meredith took up the button accordion and at the age of fourteen, when Ellen promised him a brand new \"Melba\" model if he learnt how to play on his father's old and patched Mezon. He learned to play from the locals as well as learning some tunes from the gramophone. At seventeen or eighteen he began to assist with the playing at local dances and later would play for the entire evening if no other musician was available.\n\nMeredith was educated at Holbrook Public School until the age of fourteen but was unable to complete the [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|Intermediate Certificate]] as the family did not have the means to purchase the required school books.  He developed an interest in Australian bush songs when he bought a copy of Banjo Paterson's Old Bush Songs. At the same time, he discovered photography. These three discoveries, music, bush songs and photographs were to become Meredith's lifetime passions.\n\nHe continued to develop his skills as a photographer and musician whilst working in Holbrook at a pharmacy. In 1944 Meredith moved to Melbourne and three years later decided to travel the east coast of Australia on his pushbike, picking up work where he could. During this time, Meredith travelled from Melbourne to Cairns and eventually settled in Sydney. In Sydney, Meredith joined the Eureka Youth League, the Communist Party, and the People's Choir. It was at this time that he began to seek out traditional Australian songs to include in the choir's repertoire.\n\nIn 1952 he was introduced to Jack Lee, an old man known as \"Hoop-iron\". \"Hoop-iron\" knew many of the old bush songs Meredith had been trying to find and Meredith started to record them. He soon discovered that he had uncovered an entire network of old singers and musicians who knew material that was assumed to have been lost from Australian culture. Meredith's long career as a folklore collector began. In the early 1950s Meredith formed Australia's first bush band The Bushwhackers (unrelated to the contemporary band of similar name). The band received much attention after performing in the very successful Sydney New Theatre production of the musical Reedy River, by Dick Diamond.\n\nIn 1954 Meredith became the secretary of the newly formed Australian Folklore Society and also assisted in the formation of the [[Bush Music Club]] in Sydney. During this time he spent every available weekend travelling throughout NSW collecting songs and dance tunes from some of Australia's finest traditional singers. In 1960 Meredith was the recipient of an Australian Literature Fund Grant for 500 pounds to publish a book based on his field work and recordings. He suffered a heart attack at this time and the book, Folk Songs of Australia, co-written by Hugh Anderson, did not appear until 1967. For the next ten years, Meredith continued to write about his work and published many more books about folk life in Australia.\n\n=== The Bushwhackers and ''Reedy River'' ===\n\nIn 1952, Meredith formed the first Australian [[bush band]] with Jack Barrie and Brian Loughlin (misspelled Loughlan in some sources). Originally known as The Heathcote Bushwhackers, they were later simply known as The Bushwhackers. Meredith had begun to collect and record bush music and songs and the band aimed to perform this new repertoire to promote the folk music traditions of rural Australia. The band were unique in that they performed with traditional bush instruments. Meredith played the button (or bush) accordion or squeezebox, and the tin whistle. Barrie played the bush bass or tea chest bass and Loughlin played the lagerphone, also known as the Murrumbidgee River Rattler. Late in 1952 they gave their first performance at the Rivoli Hall in Hurstville. It was at this time that the name of the band was permanently changed to The Bushwhackers.\n\nIn December 1953 the band performed in the [[New Theatre (Newtown)|Sydney New Theatre]] amateur production of [[Reedy River (musical)|''Reedy River'']], an Australian musical play written by Dick Diamond featuring bush and Australian folk music, some of which had been collected by Meredith. The success of ''Reedy River'' primarily inspired the Australian folk music revival of the 1950s. During that period, membership of the Bushwhackers expanded to include a number of the cast of the musical as well as others, eventually including Harry Kay, [[Alex Hood|Alex (Alec) Hood]], Cedric Grivas, Alan Scott and [[Chris Kempster]]. In 1954 Meredith was one of the founding members of the first club set up to cater to this interest, the Bush Music Club of Sydney.\n\nThe Bushwhackers disbanded in 1957. Various of its members continued to perform in bush bands such as \"The Rambleers\" and \"The Galahs\", while Meredith continued to collect field recordings of Australian traditional and folk music, as well as performing with \"The Shearers\" and the Bush Music Club's \"Concert Party\".\n\n=== Later life ===\n\nIn 1981 Meredith re-discovered his love for collecting and photographing Australian bush singers and musicians, which he continued to do until his health failed him.  The Meredith Collection is housed at the National Library of Australia and contains nearly 8,000 catalogued items including photos and material collected from over 700 performers.  This included unpublished manuscripts such as '[[William Henry Ogilvie|Will Ogilvie]] \u2013 the Scottish jackaroo'.\n\nIn 2001, Meredith passed away in [[Albury]], New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: John Meredith, AM|url=http://folkstream.com/reviews/revival/merobit.html|website=Australian Folk Songs|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>  He never married.

He wrote several [[playwright|plays]], including ''The Wild Colonial Boy'' with Joan Clarke, first produced by Brisbane New Theatre in 1955, and ''How Many Miles from Gundagai'' performed by the Bushwhackers.\n\n=== Song collecting ===\nSome of the songs and music featured in the production of ''Reedy River'' had been collected by Meredith himself. He collected a wide variety of folk music, including [[Sally Sloane]], a traditional singer with a large repertoire of songs many of which had not been collected previously. Meredith also collected songs by [[Duke Tritton]], a poet and songwriter whose work reflected his experiences as a [[Sheep shearing|shearer]] and as an unemployed itinerant worker during the [[Great Depression]]. Both song books and non-fiction works on the [[folklore]] of Australia were published by Meredith over the course of his career.\n\nMeredith continued to collect field recordings of traditional songs and music throughout his life.

The Meredith Collection is housed at the National Library of Australia and contains nearly 8,000 catalogued items including photos and material collected from over 700 performers.  This included unpublished manuscripts such as '[[William Henry Ogilvie|Will Ogilvie]] \u2013 the Scottish jackaroo'.\n\nIn 2001, Meredith passed away in [[Albury]], New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: John Meredith, AM|url=http://folkstream.com/reviews/revival/merobit.html|website=Australian Folk Songs|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>  He never married.

He wrote several [[playwright|plays]], including ''The Wild Colonial Boy'' with Joan Clarke, first produced by Brisbane New Theatre in 1955, and ''How Many Miles from Gundagai'' performed by the Bushwhackers.\n\n=== Song collecting ===\nSome of the songs and music featured in the production of ''Reedy River'' had been collected by Meredith himself. He collected a wide variety of folk music, including [[Sally Sloane]], a traditional singer with a large repertoire of songs many of which had not been collected previously. Meredith also collected songs by [[Duke Tritton]], a poet and songwriter whose work reflected his experiences as a [[Sheep shearing|shearer]] and as an unemployed itinerant worker during the [[Great Depression]]. Both song books and non-fiction works on the [[folklore]] of Australia were published by Meredith over the course of his career.\n\nMeredith continued to collect field recordings of traditional songs and music throughout his life. His recordings are housed in the Meredith Collection at the [[National Library of Australia]].<ref>Music Australia website and Information provided by John Meredith held by AustLit at the Australian Defence Force Academy, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n===Books===\n* ''Bushwhacker Songs: Old and New'' Sydney: John Meredith, ca.1955\n* ''Songs From Lawson'' By Henry Lawson, edited by John Meredith.

It was released on 6 October 1974 through [[Island Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America. It was their last studio recording of the 1970s and the last before lead member [[Robert Fripp]] temporarily disbanded the group. Though their lowest-charting album at the time, spending only one week in the UK charts, ''Red'' has received significant critical acclaim.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\nMuch of the material on ''Red'' has origins in improvisation. Motifs that would eventually be used for \"Fallen Angel\" were first played by Robert Fripp in 1972, as part of improvs performed with the quintet lineup that would record ''Larks' Tongues In Aspic''. These improvisations are documented as \"Fallen Angel\" and \"Fallen Angel Hullabaloo\" in the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, as well as standalone releases of their respective concerts. The distinctive introduction to \"One More Red Nightmare\" was also deployed by [[John Wetton]] and Robert Fripp in various improvs throughout 1974, which can be heard in the ''[[Starless (box set)]]'' and ''[[The Road to Red]]'' box sets. One notable performance is titled \"The Golden Walnut\". Lastly, \"Providence\" itself was an improv, taken from the group's show on 30 June in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It has been included in its uncut form as part of various live sets, such as ''[[The Great Deceiver (King Crimson album)|The Great Deceiver]]'', as well as the 40th Anniversary Edition of ''Red'' itself.\n\n\"Red\" was composed solely by Robert Fripp. In an analysis of the piece by [[Andrew Keeling]], he describes \"Red\" as \"an instrumental piece scored for electric guitar (multi-tracked X3), bass guitar and drums,\" as well as \"one of the more muscular pieces of Robert Fripp's, in particular the deployment of open strings and heavily attacked and syncopated bass and drums.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keeling|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Keeling|title=King Crimson: Red \u2013 An Analysis by Andrew Keeling|url=http://www.songsouponsea.com/Keeling/Keeling-Red.html|website=Song Soup on Sea|publisher=Peter Sinfield|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> In an online diary from 2012, Robert Fripp speaks about the development of \"Red\": \"A motif; moved from [the missing piece] \"Blue\" to \"Red\": the opening and closing theme of \"Red\" itself. The driving, relentless figure that follows it, and the middle figure played by the basses, weren't enough for a complete piece.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries/Robert%20Fripp/dgm-hq-while-in-the-210916 |title=DGM HQ |last=Fripp |first=Robert |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |date=June 12, 2012 |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> Speaking about it in the book accompanying the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, he says, \"After we had just recorded the track \"Red\" in [[Olympic Studios|[Olympic Studios]]] ... we played it back and [[Bill Bruford|Bill]] said, 'I don't get it, but if you tell me it's good, I trust you.' ...

At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a \"cold reception\" from both Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford. Later, an introductory theme was written by Robert Fripp and performed on violin by [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and two additional sections were added after the vocal, one being contributed by Bruford.<ref name=BoffomuInt>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=June 3, 2016}} Event occurs at 5:15\u20137:01.</ref> The final section reprises various themes from earlier in the song, and it also re-uses a bass part which was originally written for the song \"Fracture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/tour-dates/295 |title=University of Texas Arlington |last=Smith |first=Sid |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> This early arrangement of \"Fracture\" can be heard on discs 1 and 25 of the ''[[Starless (box set)|Starless]]'' box set, as well as the standalone releases of their respective concerts.

This led to some occasional confusion amongst listeners about precisely what was being sung, particularly on the song \"One More Red Nightmare.\" The first printing of the lyrics would occur 26 years after the album's initial release, on the 2000 '30th Anniversary Edition' release.\n\nNear the conclusion of King Crimson's 1974 [[North America]]n tour, the decision was made to kick Cross out of the band. [[E.G. Records|EG]], the band's management, urged Fripp not to tell Cross until after the final date of the tour, but he would not be able to anyway; he would not return from the [[United States]] until after Cross would return to [[Europe]]. Fripp reached an agreement with EG that they would tell Cross, \"on proviso that [he] is told that I objected to not telling him personally.\" Despite reaching this agreement, Cross would not be told about the decision for him to leave the band until the day before the recording of ''Red'' began.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fripp |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Fripp |date=2013 |title=The Road To Red |chapter=Robert Fripp Diaries |pages=32 }}</ref> In his stead, the band brought back several contributors to past albums: [[Robin Miller (musician)|Robin Miller]] on [[oboe]], [[Marc Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Ian McDonald (musician)|Ian McDonald]] and [[Mel Collins]] on [[saxophone]], as well as an uncredited [[cello|cellist]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dgmlive.com/in-depth/red-the-long-view|title=Red \u2013 The Long View|date=2016-11-03|work=DGM Live|access-date=2020-02-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Red'' sees King Crimson follow in the direction established by their previous two albums, ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' and ''Starless and Bible Black'', but in contrast to those albums, ''Red'' features more layered production with several [[guitar]] [[overdubs]] on certain tracks, as well as the return of earlier instrumentation such as saxophone. ''Red'' having a heavier tone was largely due to the [[rhythm section]] of John Wetton and Bill Bruford, which Fripp has referred to as \"the flying brick wall\".

In the United States, it reached No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. However, it remained a popular album with fans and critics.\n\nRetrospective reviews were resoundingly positive. In theirs, [[AllMusic]] declared ''Red'' to be weaker than its two predecessors, but nonetheless a superlative work: \"few intact groups could have gotten an album as good as ''Red'' together. The fact that it was put together by a band in its death throes makes it all the more impressive an achievement.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also applauded the album, having been generally critical of the group's past work, calling it \"Grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical\" and commenting that \"this does for classical-rock fusion what [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' did for jazz-rock fusion.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' reviewer considered ''Red'' \"a walk down a lightless corridor and an unhappy and ferocious counterbalance to the frolics of King Crimson's beginnings\", and described it as \"dark, brooding and laden with heavily distorted sections and a decidedly melancholic vibe\".<ref name=\"classic\"/>\n\nLike most of King Crimson's catalogue, ''Red'' has been re-released numerous times since its release. First issued on CD in 1986, it has also been released as part of the Definitive Edition and 30th Anniversary Edition series. In 2009, ''Red'' was chosen, alongside ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' and ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'', to launch the 40th Anniversary Edition series. As part of this series, each album is presented in a CD/DVD-A package, with new [[stereo]] and [[surround|5.1 surround]] mixes. Unlike most others in series, however, ''Red'' launched with no new stereo mix. In 2013, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp produced a stereo remix for ''[[The Road To Red]]'', and this mix was issued separately as part of a 2CD package.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2001, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named ''Red'' as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50+Heaviest|title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and [[Kurt Cobain]] had reportedly cited the album as a major influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Robert_Fripp_in_Rock_and_Folk|title=Interview with Robert Fripp in Rock and Folk \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Bill_Bruford_in_Percussioni_(in_Italian)|title=Interview with Bill Bruford in Percussioni (in Italian) \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider ''Red'', and particularly the track \"[[Starless]]\", to be the highlight of King Crimson's recorded output.\n\nThe title track was ranked number 87 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530224813/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/36 ''Rolling Stone'' \u2013 The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time].

It was released on 6 October 1974 through [[Island Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America. It was their last studio recording of the 1970s and the last before lead member [[Robert Fripp]] temporarily disbanded the group. Though their lowest-charting album at the time, spending only one week in the UK charts, ''Red'' has received significant critical acclaim.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\nMuch of the material on ''Red'' has origins in improvisation. Motifs that would eventually be used for \"Fallen Angel\" were first played by Robert Fripp in 1972, as part of improvs performed with the quintet lineup that would record ''Larks' Tongues In Aspic''. These improvisations are documented as \"Fallen Angel\" and \"Fallen Angel Hullabaloo\" in the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, as well as standalone releases of their respective concerts. The distinctive introduction to \"One More Red Nightmare\" was also deployed by [[John Wetton]] and Robert Fripp in various improvs throughout 1974, which can be heard in the ''[[Starless (box set)]]'' and ''[[The Road to Red]]'' box sets. One notable performance is titled \"The Golden Walnut\". Lastly, \"Providence\" itself was an improv, taken from the group's show on 30 June in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It has been included in its uncut form as part of various live sets, such as ''[[The Great Deceiver (King Crimson album)|The Great Deceiver]]'', as well as the 40th Anniversary Edition of ''Red'' itself.\n\n\"Red\" was composed solely by Robert Fripp. In an analysis of the piece by [[Andrew Keeling]], he describes \"Red\" as \"an instrumental piece scored for electric guitar (multi-tracked X3), bass guitar and drums,\" as well as \"one of the more muscular pieces of Robert Fripp's, in particular the deployment of open strings and heavily attacked and syncopated bass and drums.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keeling|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Keeling|title=King Crimson: Red \u2013 An Analysis by Andrew Keeling|url=http://www.songsouponsea.com/Keeling/Keeling-Red.html|website=Song Soup on Sea|publisher=Peter Sinfield|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> In an online diary from 2012, Robert Fripp speaks about the development of \"Red\": \"A motif; moved from [the missing piece] \"Blue\" to \"Red\": the opening and closing theme of \"Red\" itself. The driving, relentless figure that follows it, and the middle figure played by the basses, weren't enough for a complete piece.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries/Robert%20Fripp/dgm-hq-while-in-the-210916 |title=DGM HQ |last=Fripp |first=Robert |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |date=June 12, 2012 |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> Speaking about it in the book accompanying the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, he says, \"After we had just recorded the track \"Red\" in [[Olympic Studios|[Olympic Studios]]] ... we played it back and [[Bill Bruford|Bill]] said, 'I don't get it, but if you tell me it's good, I trust you.' ...

At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a \"cold reception\" from both Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford. Later, an introductory theme was written by Robert Fripp and performed on violin by [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and two additional sections were added after the vocal, one being contributed by Bruford.<ref name=BoffomuInt>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=June 3, 2016}} Event occurs at 5:15\u20137:01.</ref> The final section reprises various themes from earlier in the song, and it also re-uses a bass part which was originally written for the song \"Fracture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/tour-dates/295 |title=University of Texas Arlington |last=Smith |first=Sid |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> This early arrangement of \"Fracture\" can be heard on discs 1 and 25 of the ''[[Starless (box set)|Starless]]'' box set, as well as the standalone releases of their respective concerts.

This led to some occasional confusion amongst listeners about precisely what was being sung, particularly on the song \"One More Red Nightmare.\" The first printing of the lyrics would occur 26 years after the album's initial release, on the 2000 '30th Anniversary Edition' release.\n\nNear the conclusion of King Crimson's 1974 [[North America]]n tour, the decision was made to kick Cross out of the band. [[E.G. Records|EG]], the band's management, urged Fripp not to tell Cross until after the final date of the tour, but he would not be able to anyway; he would not return from the [[United States]] until after Cross would return to [[Europe]]. Fripp reached an agreement with EG that they would tell Cross, \"on proviso that [he] is told that I objected to not telling him personally.\" Despite reaching this agreement, Cross would not be told about the decision for him to leave the band until the day before the recording of ''Red'' began.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fripp |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Fripp |date=2013 |title=The Road To Red |chapter=Robert Fripp Diaries |pages=32 }}</ref> In his stead, the band brought back several contributors to past albums: [[Robin Miller (musician)|Robin Miller]] on [[oboe]], [[Marc Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Ian McDonald (musician)|Ian McDonald]] and [[Mel Collins]] on [[saxophone]], as well as an uncredited [[cello|cellist]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dgmlive.com/in-depth/red-the-long-view|title=Red \u2013 The Long View|date=2016-11-03|work=DGM Live|access-date=2020-02-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Red'' sees King Crimson follow in the direction established by their previous two albums, ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' and ''Starless and Bible Black'', but in contrast to those albums, ''Red'' features more layered production with several [[guitar]] [[overdubs]] on certain tracks, as well as the return of earlier instrumentation such as saxophone. ''Red'' having a heavier tone was largely due to the [[rhythm section]] of John Wetton and Bill Bruford, which Fripp has referred to as \"the flying brick wall\".

In the United States, it reached No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. However, it remained a popular album with fans and critics.\n\nRetrospective reviews were resoundingly positive. In theirs, [[AllMusic]] declared ''Red'' to be weaker than its two predecessors, but nonetheless a superlative work: \"few intact groups could have gotten an album as good as ''Red'' together. The fact that it was put together by a band in its death throes makes it all the more impressive an achievement.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also applauded the album, having been generally critical of the group's past work, calling it \"Grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical\" and commenting that \"this does for classical-rock fusion what [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' did for jazz-rock fusion.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' reviewer considered ''Red'' \"a walk down a lightless corridor and an unhappy and ferocious counterbalance to the frolics of King Crimson's beginnings\", and described it as \"dark, brooding and laden with heavily distorted sections and a decidedly melancholic vibe\".<ref name=\"classic\"/>\n\nLike most of King Crimson's catalogue, ''Red'' has been re-released numerous times since its release. First issued on CD in 1986, it has also been released as part of the Definitive Edition and 30th Anniversary Edition series. In 2009, ''Red'' was chosen, alongside ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' and ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'', to launch the 40th Anniversary Edition series. As part of this series, each album is presented in a CD/DVD-A package, with new [[stereo]] and [[surround|5.1 surround]] mixes. Unlike most others in series, however, ''Red'' launched with no new stereo mix. In 2013, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp produced a stereo remix for ''[[The Road To Red]]'', and this mix was issued separately as part of a 2CD package.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2001, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named ''Red'' as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50+Heaviest|title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and [[Kurt Cobain]] had reportedly cited the album as a major influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Robert_Fripp_in_Rock_and_Folk|title=Interview with Robert Fripp in Rock and Folk \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Bill_Bruford_in_Percussioni_(in_Italian)|title=Interview with Bill Bruford in Percussioni (in Italian) \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider ''Red'', and particularly the track \"[[Starless]]\", to be the highlight of King Crimson's recorded output.\n\nThe title track was ranked number 87 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530224813/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/36 ''Rolling Stone'' \u2013 The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time].

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

Records]] in the United Kingdom and by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movingtheriver.com/2016/10/10/king-crimsons-discipline-35-years-old-today/ |title=King Crimson's Discipline: 35 Years Old Today |last=Phillips |first=Matt |date=2016-10-10 |website=movingtheriver.com |access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> This album was King Crimson's first album following a seven-year hiatus. Only founder [[Robert Fripp]] and later addition [[Bill Bruford]] remained from previous incarnations. The rest of the band were American musicians [[Adrian Belew]] (guitar, lead vocals) and [[Tony Levin]] (bass guitar, [[Chapman Stick]], backing vocals). The album resulted in a more updated 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]]-oriented sound.\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"[[Matte Kudasai]]\" ({{lang-ja|\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}) literally means \"please wait\". The original release of ''Discipline'' featured only one version of \"Matte Kudasai\", with a guitar part by [[Robert Fripp]] that was removed from the track on a subsequent release of the album. The latest versions of the album to be released contains both versions of the song \u2013 track 3, \"Matte Kudasai\", without Robert Fripp's original guitar part; and track 8, \"Matte Kudasai (alternative version)\", with the guitar part included. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries/Robert%20Fripp/chop-em-out-mastering-olympia-210916 |title=Chop Em Out Mastering Olympia |last=Fripp |first=Robert |date=2001-01-09 |website=Robert Fripp's Diary |publisher=DGM Live |access-date=2017-07-29 |quote= We are listening to the alternative version of \"Matte\" with RF on sustained guitar lines and solo. This is the version included on the original 1981 \"Discipline\" release, and was later replaced by the original pre-overdub minimalist mix on releases after 1989. In Island studios, recording and mixing of the album completed, Adrian & I agreed that something more was needed for \"Matte\". He left it to me to come up with something, flew home, but when he heard my contribution wasn't convinced. I agree. This new re-release gives us the opportunity to include both versions, in accordance with a suggestion made a while ago on the Guestbook. }} </ref>\n\nThe lyrics of \"[[Indiscipline]]\" were based on a letter written to [[Adrian Belew]] by his then-wife Margaret, concerning a painting that she had made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_King_Crimson_in_Trouser_Press|title=Interview with King Crimson in Trouser Press|last=Arthur|first=Stephen|date=8 February 1995|website=ET Wiki|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|access-date=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Thela Hun Ginjeet]]\" is an [[anagram]] of \"heat in the jungle\". When it was first performed live, some of its lyrics were improvised around an illicit recording made by Robert Fripp of his neighbours having a vicious argument when he was living in New York; this recording is featured on the track \"NY3\" on Fripp's solo album ''[[Exposure (Robert Fripp album)|Exposure]]''.{{citation needed|reason=The claim regarding use of the New York tape is most likely false. The live in Bath 1981 recording by the band Discipline, which was the song's live premier, gives evidence of Belew singing \"My House, Your House\", but no evidence of the NY3 recording at all|date=March 2015}} While the track was being recorded for the ''Discipline'' album, Adrian Belew, walking around [[Notting Hill Gate]] in [[London]] with a [[tape recorder]] looking for inspiration, was harassed first by a gang and then by the police. On returning to the studio, he gave a distraught account to his bandmates of what had just happened to him. This account was recorded by Fripp, without Belew's knowledge, as well <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elephant-blog.blogspot.com/2007/04/anecdote-808.html|title=elephant blog: Anecdote # 808|last=Belew|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Belew|date=2007-04-03|website=elephant blog|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and is featured on the ''Discipline'' version of the track (as well as almost all live versions), in place of those earlier lyrics that were based on Fripp's New York recording.\n\n\"The Sheltering Sky\" is named after and partially inspired by [[The Sheltering Sky|the 1949 novel of the same name]] by [[Paul Bowles]]. Bowles is often associated with the [[Beat generation]], which would be an inspiration for King Crimson's subsequent studio album ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]''.\n\n[[File:\"Possible Productions knotwork\" by Steve Ball.png|left|thumb|Later versions of ''Discipline'' featured this design by Steve Ball.]]\n\nLive versions of \"Elephant Talk\", \"Indiscipline\", and \"Thela Hun Ginjeet\" included partial vocal improvisation during spoken-word parts.

Records]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movingtheriver.com/2016/10/10/king-crimsons-discipline-35-years-old-today/ |title=King Crimson's Discipline: 35 Years Old Today |last=Phillips |first=Matt |date=2016-10-10 |website=movingtheriver.com |access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> This album was King Crimson's first album following a seven-year hiatus. Only founder [[Robert Fripp]] and later addition [[Bill Bruford]] remained from previous incarnations. The rest of the band were American musicians [[Adrian Belew]] (guitar, lead vocals) and [[Tony Levin]] (bass guitar, [[Chapman Stick]], backing vocals). The album resulted in a more updated 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]]-oriented sound.\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"[[Matte Kudasai]]\" ({{lang-ja|\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}) literally means \"please wait\". The original release of ''Discipline'' featured only one version of \"Matte Kudasai\", with a guitar part by [[Robert Fripp]] that was removed from the track on a subsequent release of the album. The latest versions of the album to be released contains both versions of the song \u2013 track 3, \"Matte Kudasai\", without Robert Fripp's original guitar part; and track 8, \"Matte Kudasai (alternative version)\", with the guitar part included. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries/Robert%20Fripp/chop-em-out-mastering-olympia-210916 |title=Chop Em Out Mastering Olympia |last=Fripp |first=Robert |date=2001-01-09 |website=Robert Fripp's Diary |publisher=DGM Live |access-date=2017-07-29 |quote= We are listening to the alternative version of \"Matte\" with RF on sustained guitar lines and solo. This is the version included on the original 1981 \"Discipline\" release, and was later replaced by the original pre-overdub minimalist mix on releases after 1989. In Island studios, recording and mixing of the album completed, Adrian & I agreed that something more was needed for \"Matte\". He left it to me to come up with something, flew home, but when he heard my contribution wasn't convinced. I agree. This new re-release gives us the opportunity to include both versions, in accordance with a suggestion made a while ago on the Guestbook. }} </ref>\n\nThe lyrics of \"[[Indiscipline]]\" were based on a letter written to [[Adrian Belew]] by his then-wife Margaret, concerning a painting that she had made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_King_Crimson_in_Trouser_Press|title=Interview with King Crimson in Trouser Press|last=Arthur|first=Stephen|date=8 February 1995|website=ET Wiki|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|access-date=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Thela Hun Ginjeet]]\" is an [[anagram]] of \"heat in the jungle\". When it was first performed live, some of its lyrics were improvised around an illicit recording made by Robert Fripp of his neighbours having a vicious argument when he was living in New York; this recording is featured on the track \"NY3\" on Fripp's solo album ''[[Exposure (Robert Fripp album)|Exposure]]''.{{citation needed|reason=The claim regarding use of the New York tape is most likely false. The live in Bath 1981 recording by the band Discipline, which was the song's live premier, gives evidence of Belew singing \"My House, Your House\", but no evidence of the NY3 recording at all|date=March 2015}} While the track was being recorded for the ''Discipline'' album, Adrian Belew, walking around [[Notting Hill Gate]] in [[London]] with a [[tape recorder]] looking for inspiration, was harassed first by a gang and then by the police. On returning to the studio, he gave a distraught account to his bandmates of what had just happened to him. This account was recorded by Fripp, without Belew's knowledge, as well <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elephant-blog.blogspot.com/2007/04/anecdote-808.html|title=elephant blog: Anecdote # 808|last=Belew|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Belew|date=2007-04-03|website=elephant blog|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and is featured on the ''Discipline'' version of the track (as well as almost all live versions), in place of those earlier lyrics that were based on Fripp's New York recording.\n\n\"The Sheltering Sky\" is named after and partially inspired by [[The Sheltering Sky|the 1949 novel of the same name]] by [[Paul Bowles]]. Bowles is often associated with the [[Beat generation]], which would be an inspiration for King Crimson's subsequent studio album ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]''.\n\n[[File:\"Possible Productions knotwork\" by Steve Ball.png|left|thumb|Later versions of ''Discipline'' featured this design by Steve Ball.]]\n\nLive versions of \"Elephant Talk\", \"Indiscipline\", and \"Thela Hun Ginjeet\" included partial vocal improvisation during spoken-word parts. One such example can be found in the 13 August 1982 performance, which, as of 12 August 2014, was still available for download in both [[MP3]] and [[FLAC]] formats from [[Discipline Global Mobile|DGM]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe back cover features the statement, \"Discipline is never an end in itself, only a means to an end\".
