He was born in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] and graduated from the prestigious [[Tokyo University]], where he was a student of {{nihongo|Kazutoshi Ueda|\u4e0a\u7530\u4e07\u5e74||''Ueda Kazutoshi'', 1867\u20131937}}. After studying in Germany, Ueda taught [[comparative linguistics]] and edited foreign-language dictionaries in the latter part of the [[Meiji era]]. Through his tutelage, Shinmura became involved in [[Japanese language]] lexicography. Even ''K\u014djien'' editions published after his death credit Shinmura as the chief editor.\n\n== History ==\n===Jien===\nThe predecessor of ''K\u014djien'' originated during the [[Great Depression in East Asia]]. In 1930, the publisher Shigeo Oka (\u5ca1\u8302\u96c4, ''Oka Shigeo'', 1894\u20131989) wanted to create a Japanese dictionary for high school students. He asked his friend Shinmura to be chief editor, and they chose the title ''Jien'' (\u8f9e\u82d1 \"Garden of words\") in a classical allusion to the ''[[Ziyuan (book)|Ziyuan]]'' (\u5b57\u82d1, \"Garden of characters\") [[Chinese dictionary]]. Shinmura appointed his son Takeshi Shinmura (\u65b0\u6751\u731b, ''Shinmura Takeshi'', 1905\u20131992) as an editor, and in 1935, Hakubunkan (\u535a\u6587\u9928) published the ''Jien'' dictionary. It contained some 160,000 [[headword]] entries of old and new Japanese vocabulary, as well as encyclopedic content, and quickly became a bestseller.\n\n===1st edition===\nThe editors began working on a revised edition, but the 1945 [[Firebombing of Tokyo]] destroyed their work. After the war, Shinmura and his lexicographers began anew in September 1948. Iwanami Shoten published the first ''K\u014djien'' in 1955. It included approximately 200,000 headwords, about 40,000 more than the ''Jien''. \n\n===2nd edition===\nThe 2nd edition (1969) deleted about 20,000 old entries and added about 20,000 new ones, especially scientific terms.\n\nOn December 1, 1976, a revised and expanded version ({{nihongo||\u88dc\u8a02\u7248|''hoteiban''}}) of the 2nd edition was published.\n\n===3rd edition===\nThe 3rd edition (1983) added 12,000 entries, and was published in [[CD-ROM]] format in 1987.\n\n===4th edition===\nThree major Japanese publishers released new dictionaries specifically designed to compete with the Iwanami's popular and profitable ''K\u014djien'': Sanseid\u014d's ''[[Daijirin]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5927\u8f9e\u6797</span> \"Great forest of words\", 1988), Sh\u014dgakukan's ''[[Daijisen]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9</span> \"Great fountainhead of words\", 1995), and K\u014ddansha's ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178</span> \"Great dictionary of Japanese\" 1989). In response, the 4th edition ''K\u014djien'' (1991) was a major revision that added some 15,000 entry words, bringing the total to over 220,000. The CD-ROM version was published in 1993 and revised with color illustrations (like the ''Nihongo daijiten'') in 1996. \n\nIn 1992, Iwanami published both an [[e-book]] format 4th edition and a useful ''Gyakubiki K\u014djien'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u9006\u5f15\u304d\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1</span> \"Reverse dictionary ''K\u014djien''\"). \n\n===5th edition===\nThe 5th edition (1998) includes over 230,000 headwords, and its 2996 pages contain an estimated total of 14 million characters. Iwanami Shoten currently publishes ''K\u014djien'' in several printed and digital formats, and also sells dictionary subscription services for [[cell phone]] and Internet access. Various manufacturers of [[Japanese electronic dictionaries]] have licensed the digital ''K\u014djien'', and it is the core dictionary in many models.\n\nShinmura's preface to the 1st edition stated his hope that the ''K\u014djien'' would become regarded as the standard by which other dictionaries would be measured. This has largely been fulfilled; many people regard the ''K\u014djien'' as the most authoritative Japanese language dictionary on the market. It remains a bestseller in Japan. According to Iwanami, the 1st edition ''K\u014djien'' sold over one million copies, and the 5th edition brought cumulative total sales to over eleven million in 2000.\n\n===6th edition===\nThe sixth edition was released on January 11, 2008, includes more than 10,000 new entries, bringing the total to approximately 240,000. It also contains an additional 1,500 quotations.<ref name=\"Yomiuri\" />\n\n===7th edition===\nThe seventh edition was released on January 12, 2018.

Baroni and Bialock (2005) describe the ''K\u014djien'' as \"an old standard that gives extensive definitions, etymologies (as always take care with these), and variant usages for words, places, historical and literary figures, and ''[[furigana]]'' for difficult or old terms.\"\n\nThis dictionary is notable for including current Japanese [[catchphrase]]s and [[buzzword]]s. For instance, the 4th edition added ''fur\u012bt\u0101'' (\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc \"a part-time worker by choice\"), which blends two loanwords: ''fur\u012b'' (\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc \"free\", from English, as in ''fur\u012bransu'' \u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9 \"freelance\") and ''arubait\u0101'' (\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc \"part-time worker\", from German ''Arbeiter'' \"worker\").\n\nThe ''K\u014djien'' dictionary had a censorship policy before it became politically correct (see ''[[kotobagari]]''), and omitted [[taboo]] words such as sexual slang or offensive terms. It includes encyclopedic information such as 2700 illustrations and maps, and mini-biographies of notable people (both living and dead foreigners, but only deceased Japanese). The appendices include [[Japanese grammar]] notes, ''[[kanji]]'' with difficult readings, [[Japanese calendar]] and [[Gregorian calendar]] charts, and lists of ''[[gairaigo]]'' acronyms.\n\nGally (1999) says, \"''Koujien'' is a fine dictionary with a sterling reputation. Because it gives definitions in historical order, it is the best single-volume choice for people interested in how the meanings of words have changed over time.\" However, he notes, \"In my experience as a translator of contemporary Japanese, though, I have found ''Koujien'' less useful than ''[[Daijirin]]''.\" This criticism is based on his use of the fourth edition, though, and he concedes that later editions seem to have improved in this regard.\n \n==Kojien University==\nAs part of the publication of Kojien 7th edition, Kojien University (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66</span>) seminars were held in 2018-01-12 and 2018-01-14.<ref>[https://hon.booklog.jp/report/kojiendaigaku-20180125 \u3064\u3044\u306b\u958b\u8b1b\uff01\u7b2c1\u56de\u300c\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66\u300d\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff01\u3055\u3089\u306b\u520a\u884c\u8a18\u5ff5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u300f\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\uff01]</ref> Second round of the seminars were planned in 2018-02-10.<ref>[https://kojien-univ.jp/ \u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u958b\u8b1b\uff01]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Baroni, Helen; and Bialock, David (2005).

He was born in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] and graduated from the prestigious [[Tokyo University]], where he was a student of {{nihongo|Kazutoshi Ueda|\u4e0a\u7530\u4e07\u5e74||''Ueda Kazutoshi'', 1867\u20131937}}. After studying in Germany, Ueda taught [[comparative linguistics]] and edited foreign-language dictionaries in the latter part of the [[Meiji era]]. Through his tutelage, Shinmura became involved in [[Japanese language]] lexicography. Even ''K\u014djien'' editions published after his death credit Shinmura as the chief editor.\n\n== History ==\n===Jien===\nThe predecessor of ''K\u014djien'' originated during the [[Great Depression in East Asia]]. In 1930, the publisher Shigeo Oka (\u5ca1\u8302\u96c4, ''Oka Shigeo'', 1894\u20131989) wanted to create a Japanese dictionary for high school students. He asked his friend Shinmura to be chief editor, and they chose the title ''Jien'' (\u8f9e\u82d1 \"Garden of words\") in a classical allusion to the ''[[Ziyuan (book)|Ziyuan]]'' (\u5b57\u82d1, \"Garden of characters\") [[Chinese dictionary]]. Shinmura appointed his son Takeshi Shinmura (\u65b0\u6751\u731b, ''Shinmura Takeshi'', 1905\u20131992) as an editor, and in 1935, Hakubunkan (\u535a\u6587\u9928) published the ''Jien'' dictionary. It contained some 160,000 [[headword]] entries of old and new Japanese vocabulary, as well as encyclopedic content, and quickly became a bestseller.\n\n===1st edition===\nThe editors began working on a revised edition, but the 1945 [[Firebombing of Tokyo]] destroyed their work. After the war, Shinmura and his lexicographers began anew in September 1948. Iwanami Shoten published the first ''K\u014djien'' in 1955. It included approximately 200,000 headwords, about 40,000 more than the ''Jien''. \n\n===2nd edition===\nThe 2nd edition (1969) deleted about 20,000 old entries and added about 20,000 new ones, especially scientific terms.\n\nOn December 1, 1976, a revised and expanded version ({{nihongo||\u88dc\u8a02\u7248|''hoteiban''}}) of the 2nd edition was published.\n\n===3rd edition===\nThe 3rd edition (1983) added 12,000 entries, and was published in [[CD-ROM]] format in 1987.\n\n===4th edition===\nThree major Japanese publishers released new dictionaries specifically designed to compete with the Iwanami's popular and profitable ''K\u014djien'': Sanseid\u014d's ''[[Daijirin]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5927\u8f9e\u6797</span> \"Great forest of words\", 1988), Sh\u014dgakukan's ''[[Daijisen]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9</span> \"Great fountainhead of words\", 1995), and K\u014ddansha's ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178</span> \"Great dictionary of Japanese\" 1989). In response, the 4th edition ''K\u014djien'' (1991) was a major revision that added some 15,000 entry words, bringing the total to over 220,000. The CD-ROM version was published in 1993 and revised with color illustrations (like the ''Nihongo daijiten'') in 1996. \n\nIn 1992, Iwanami published both an [[e-book]] format 4th edition and a useful ''Gyakubiki K\u014djien'' (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u9006\u5f15\u304d\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1</span> \"Reverse dictionary ''K\u014djien''\"). \n\n===5th edition===\nThe 5th edition (1998) includes over 230,000 headwords, and its 2996 pages contain an estimated total of 14 million characters. Iwanami Shoten currently publishes ''K\u014djien'' in several printed and digital formats, and also sells dictionary subscription services for [[cell phone]] and Internet access. Various manufacturers of [[Japanese electronic dictionaries]] have licensed the digital ''K\u014djien'', and it is the core dictionary in many models.\n\nShinmura's preface to the 1st edition stated his hope that the ''K\u014djien'' would become regarded as the standard by which other dictionaries would be measured. This has largely been fulfilled; many people regard the ''K\u014djien'' as the most authoritative Japanese language dictionary on the market. It remains a bestseller in Japan. According to Iwanami, the 1st edition ''K\u014djien'' sold over one million copies, and the 5th edition brought cumulative total sales to over eleven million in 2000.\n\n===6th edition===\nThe sixth edition was released on January 11, 2008, includes more than 10,000 new entries, bringing the total to approximately 240,000. It also contains an additional 1,500 quotations.<ref name=\"Yomiuri\" />\n\n===7th edition===\nThe seventh edition was released on January 12, 2018.

Baroni and Bialock (2005) describe the ''K\u014djien'' as \"an old standard that gives extensive definitions, etymologies (as always take care with these), and variant usages for words, places, historical and literary figures, and ''[[furigana]]'' for difficult or old terms.\"\n\nThis dictionary is notable for including current Japanese [[catchphrase]]s and [[buzzword]]s. For instance, the 4th edition added ''fur\u012bt\u0101'' (\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc \"a part-time worker by choice\"), which blends two loanwords: ''fur\u012b'' (\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc \"free\", from English, as in ''fur\u012bransu'' \u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9 \"freelance\") and ''arubait\u0101'' (\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc \"part-time worker\", from German ''Arbeiter'' \"worker\").\n\nThe ''K\u014djien'' dictionary had a censorship policy before it became politically correct (see ''[[kotobagari]]''), and omitted [[taboo]] words such as sexual slang or offensive terms. It includes encyclopedic information such as 2700 illustrations and maps, and mini-biographies of notable people (both living and dead foreigners, but only deceased Japanese). The appendices include [[Japanese grammar]] notes, ''[[kanji]]'' with difficult readings, [[Japanese calendar]] and [[Gregorian calendar]] charts, and lists of ''[[gairaigo]]'' acronyms.\n\nGally (1999) says, \"''Koujien'' is a fine dictionary with a sterling reputation. Because it gives definitions in historical order, it is the best single-volume choice for people interested in how the meanings of words have changed over time.\" However, he notes, \"In my experience as a translator of contemporary Japanese, though, I have found ''Koujien'' less useful than ''[[Daijirin]]''.\" This criticism is based on his use of the fourth edition, though, and he concedes that later editions seem to have improved in this regard.\n \n==Kojien University==\nAs part of the publication of Kojien 7th edition, Kojien University (<span lang=\"Ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66</span>) seminars were held in 2018-01-12 and 2018-01-14.<ref>[https://hon.booklog.jp/report/kojiendaigaku-20180125 \u3064\u3044\u306b\u958b\u8b1b\uff01\u7b2c1\u56de\u300c\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66\u300d\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff01\u3055\u3089\u306b\u520a\u884c\u8a18\u5ff5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u300f\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\uff01]</ref> Second round of the seminars were planned in 2018-02-10.<ref>[https://kojien-univ.jp/ \u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u958b\u8b1b\uff01]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Baroni, Helen; and Bialock, David (2005).

It is also the nation's main port. The city is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Guayas Province]] and the seat of [[Guayaquil (canton)|Guayaquil canton]].\n\nThe city is located on the west bank of the [[Guayas River]], which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]].\n\n==History==\nGuayaquil was founded on July 25, 1538<ref>July 25, is an official holiday in Guayaquil. Historians have not yet reached a consensus about the date of Guayaquil's foundation or founder. The city might have been founded more than once. Another possible founder might be Diego de Almagro.</ref> with the name ''Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil'' (Most Noble and Most Loyal City of Santiago of Guayaquil) by Spanish conqueror [[Francisco de Orellana]]. Even before it was founded by the Spaniards, it already existed as a native village. <ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francisco-de-Orellana Encyclopedia Brittanica]</ref> <ref>[https://www.onthisday.com/events/date/1538/july OnThisDay.com]</ref>\n\nIn 1687, Guayaquil was attacked and looted by English and French [[pirate]]s under the command of [[George d'Hout]] (English) and Picard and Groniet (French). Of more than 260 pirates, 35 died and 46 were wounded; 75 defenders of the city died and more than 100 were wounded.\n\nIn 1709, the English captains [[Woodes Rogers]], [[Etienne Courtney]], and [[William Dampier]], along with a crew of 110, looted Guayaquil and demanded ransom; however, they suddenly departed without collecting the ransom after an epidemic of [[yellow fever]] broke out.\n\nIn colonial times Guayaquil was the chief Spanish shipyard in the Pacific, yet some navigators expressed that [[Valdivia]] had better conditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guarda |first=Gabriel |authorlink=Gabriel Guarda |title=La econom\u00eda de Chile Austral antes de la colonizaci\u00f3n alemana |url= |year=1973 |edition= |publisher=[[Universidad Austral de Chile]] |location=[[Valdivia]] |isbn= |pages=45\u201347}}</ref><ref name=Leon>{{Citation\n| last  = Le\u00f3n S\u00e1enz\n| first = Jorge\n| title = Los astilleros y la indutria matitima en el Pac\u00edfico americano: Siglos XVI a XIX\n| journal = Di\u00e1logos, Revista Electr\u00f3nica de Historia\n| volume  = 10\n| issue   = 1\n| year    = 2009\n| pages   = 44\u201390\n| url     = http://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/dialogos/article/view/6128\n}}</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 1820, almost without bloodshed, a group of civilians, supported by soldiers from the \"Granaderos de Reserva\", a battalion quartered in Guayaquil, overwhelmed the resistance of the Royalist guards and arrested the Spanish authorities. Guayaquil declared independence from Spain, becoming [[Provincia Libre de Guayaquil]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]] was named ''Jefe Civil'' (Civilian Chief) of Guayaquil.\n\nOn July 26, 1822, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] held a [[Guayaquil Conference|meeting]] in Guayaquil to plan the future of the independent South America.\n\nIn 1829, the city was [[Gran Colombia \u2013 Peru War#Assault on Guayaquil|invaded]] by the Peruvian Army, which occupied it for seven months.\n\nIn 1860, the city was the site of the [[Battle of Guayaquil]], the last of a series of military conflicts between the forces of the Provisional Government, led by [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]] and General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], and the forces of the Supreme Chief of Guayas, General [[Guillermo Franco (Ecuadorian general)|Guillermo Franco]], whose government was recognized as possessing sovereignty over the Ecuadorian territory by Peruvian president [[Ram\u00f3n Castilla]].\n\nIn 1896, large portions of the city were destroyed by a major fire.<ref>https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDU18961128.2.71&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1</ref>\n\nOn July 8, 1898, the Guayaquil City Hall \"Muy Ilustre Municipalidad de Guayaquil\" officially recognized the anthem written by Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo in 1821, with the music composed by Ana Villamil Ycaza in 1895, as the \"Himno al 9 de Octubre\" [[Canci\u00f3n al Nueve de Octubre]], most widely known now as the \"Himno a Guayaquil\" (Guayaquil Anthem).\n\nIn 1922, workers in the city went on [[1922 Guayaquil general strike|a general strike]] lasting three days. The strike ended after at least 300 people were killed by military and police.\n\nIn 2020, the city was hit hard by the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Ecuador|coronavirus pandemic]]. Its medical and mortuary services were overwhelmed to the point where bodies lay in the streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ecuador-coronavirus-bodies-are-being-left-in-the-streets-in-an-overwhelmed-city/ar-BB128I4a?ocid=spartandhp|title=Ecuador coronavirus: Bodies are being left in the streets in an overwhelmed city|website=msn.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=April 2012}}\n''Guayaquile\u00f1os' ''main sources of income are: formal and informal trade, business, agriculture and aquaculture.

As the largest city in the country, most industries are located either in the city or its peripheral areas.\n\nOngoing projects seek urban regeneration as a principal objective of the growth of the city's commercial districts, as the increase of capital produces income. These projects in the city driven by the recent mayors have achieved this goal after investing large sums of money. The current municipal administration aims to convert Guayaquil into a place for first-class international tourism and multinational businesses.<ref>Proyecto de Regeneraci\u00f3n Urbana de Guayaquil, art\u00edculo \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Guayaquil requer\u00eda regeneraci\u00f3n urbana?\" de la [http://www.guayaquil.gob.ec/61.gye M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Municipalidad de Guayaquil]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Government==\nGuayaquil's current mayor is [[Cynthia Viteri]], first female mayor ever elected. previous mayor, Jaime Nebot supported her.  He began a campaign of construction projects for the city in the early 2000s to attract tourism, that included the \"urban regeneration\" plan which reconstructed the city's main tourist streets' sidewalks and upgraded the city's chaotic transit system with multiple infrastructure projects (speedways, bridges, overhead passages, tunnels, etc.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/ecuador-guayaquil-mayor-attempts-to-bring-city-into-21st-century/focus|title=E-Ecuador|last=Pheiffer|first=Evan|date=12 November 2018|website=The Business Year|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, the city's first rapid transit bus system, [[Metrovia]], opened to provide a quicker, high-capacity service. One of the main projects was called ''[[Malec\u00f3n 2000]]'' {{IPA-es|male\u02c8kon doz \u02c8mil|}}, the renovation of the waterfront [[promenade (structure)|promenade]] (''malec\u00f3n'') along the Guayas River. Another project was the creation of the'' Nuevo Parque Hist\u00f3rico'', a park in a housing development area that is called ''Entre R\u00edos'' because it lies between the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers (which merge to form the Guayas River), in a [[mangrove]] [[wetland]] area. The park cost the city about 7 million dollars.\n\nIn 2013, the national government led by [[Rafael Correa]] built two pedestrian bridges connecting downtown Guayaquil, Santay Island, and the town of Dur\u00e1n, to allow people to make [[ecotourism]] trips on a same-day return basis. The two bridges were a big addition to the Guayas River scenery.\n\n==Geography==\nGuayaquil is the nation's largest city and the capital of Guayas Province. It is on the Guayas River about {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1}} north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, near the Equator.\n\nGuayaquil is constantly facing tsunami and major earthquake threats due to its soil stratigraphy and location near the Gulf of Guayaquil and the south of North-Andean subduction zone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ioualalen|first=M.|last2=Monfret|first2=T.|last3=B\u00e9thoux|first3=N.|last4=Chlieh|first4=M.|last5=Adams|first5=G.

Between January and April, the climate is hot and humid with heavy rainfall, especially during [[El Ni\u00f1o]] years when it increases dramatically and flooding usually occurs. The rest of the year (from May through December), however, rainfall is minimal due to the cooling influence of the [[Humboldt Current]], with usually cloudy mornings and afternoons, and evening breezes. Guayaquil, along with most of the coastal region, was impacted by the April 16, 2016 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude. A bridge that was above a major artery, Avenida de las Americas, collapsed in the early evening of April 16, killing two people.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Guayaquil\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 37.2\n|Feb record high C = 35.4\n|Mar record high C = 37.3\n|Apr record high C = 35.8\n|May record high C = 35.2\n|Jun record high C = 35.0\n|Jul record high C = 34.1\n|Aug record high C = 34.7\n|Sep record high C = 34.4\n|Oct record high C = 35.1\n|Nov record high C = 35.4\n|Dec record high C = 36.7\n|year record high C = 37.3\n|Jan high C = 31.2\n|Feb high C = 31.2\n|Mar high C = 32.2\n|Apr high C = 32.0\n|May high C = 31.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 29.1\n|Aug high C = 29.7\n|Sep high C = 30.5\n|Oct high C = 30.2\n|Nov high C = 31.1\n|Dec high C = 31.8\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 27.1\n|Feb mean C = 27.3\n|Mar mean C = 28.0\n|Apr mean C = 27.8\n|May mean C = 26.9\n|Jun mean C = 25.7\n|Jul mean C = 25.0\n|Aug mean C = 25.2\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 25.6\n|Nov mean C = 26.2\n|Dec mean C = 27.1\n|year mean C = 26.5\n|Jan low C = 23.0\n|Feb low C = 23.4\n|Mar low C = 23.7\n|Apr low C = 23.5\n|May low C = 22.6\n|Jun low C = 21.5\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 20.7\n|Sep low C = 20.5\n|Oct low C = 20.9\n|Nov low C = 21.3\n|Dec low C = 22.4\n|year low C = 22.0\n|Jan record low C = 20.0\n|Feb record low C = 15.8\n|Mar record low C = 19.9\n|Apr record low C = 19.4\n|May record low C = 18.5\n|Jun record low C = 17.6\n|Jul record low C = 17.0\n|Aug record low C = 17.2\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 17.8\n|Nov record low C = 17.0\n|Dec record low C = 18.0\n|year record low C = 15.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 200.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 332.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 315.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 207.7\n|May precipitation mm = 62.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 34.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 15.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 1.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 1.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 5.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 29.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 68.0\n|year precipitation mm = 1263.2\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 14\n|Mar precipitation days = 15\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 4\n|Jun precipitation days = 1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 0\n|Oct precipitation days = 1\n|Nov precipitation days = 0\n|Dec precipitation days = 2\n|year precipitation days = 59\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=\"WMO\">{{cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=2048|title= World Weather Information Service - Guayaquil|accessdate=16 January 2016|publisher=Met Office}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-III/EQ/84203.TXT| title = WMO Normals - Guayaquil | accessdate =16 January 2016 | publisher = NOAA}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Food==\n[[File:Ceviche ecuador.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian ceviche, made of shrimp, lime and tomato sauce]]\nTypical Guayaquil cuisine includes mostly seafood dishes such as [[encebollado]], [[ceviche]], [[cazuela]], and encocado (shrimp or tuna with a coconut sauce and rice). \n\nDuring breakfast, [[Tostones|Patacones]] and bolon (fried plantain with cheese mashed and given a rounded shape) play a big role.

Between January and April, the climate is hot and humid with heavy rainfall, especially during [[El Ni\u00f1o]] years when it increases dramatically and flooding usually occurs. The rest of the year (from May through December), however, rainfall is minimal due to the cooling influence of the [[Humboldt Current]], with usually cloudy mornings and afternoons, and evening breezes. Guayaquil, along with most of the coastal region, was impacted by the April 16, 2016 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude. A bridge that was above a major artery, Avenida de las Americas, collapsed in the early evening of April 16, killing two people.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Guayaquil\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 37.2\n|Feb record high C = 35.4\n|Mar record high C = 37.3\n|Apr record high C = 35.8\n|May record high C = 35.2\n|Jun record high C = 35.0\n|Jul record high C = 34.1\n|Aug record high C = 34.7\n|Sep record high C = 34.4\n|Oct record high C = 35.1\n|Nov record high C = 35.4\n|Dec record high C = 36.7\n|year record high C = 37.3\n|Jan high C = 31.2\n|Feb high C = 31.2\n|Mar high C = 32.2\n|Apr high C = 32.0\n|May high C = 31.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 29.1\n|Aug high C = 29.7\n|Sep high C = 30.5\n|Oct high C = 30.2\n|Nov high C = 31.1\n|Dec high C = 31.8\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 27.1\n|Feb mean C = 27.3\n|Mar mean C = 28.0\n|Apr mean C = 27.8\n|May mean C = 26.9\n|Jun mean C = 25.7\n|Jul mean C = 25.0\n|Aug mean C = 25.2\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 25.6\n|Nov mean C = 26.2\n|Dec mean C = 27.1\n|year mean C = 26.5\n|Jan low C = 23.0\n|Feb low C = 23.4\n|Mar low C = 23.7\n|Apr low C = 23.5\n|May low C = 22.6\n|Jun low C = 21.5\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 20.7\n|Sep low C = 20.5\n|Oct low C = 20.9\n|Nov low C = 21.3\n|Dec low C = 22.4\n|year low C = 22.0\n|Jan record low C = 20.0\n|Feb record low C = 15.8\n|Mar record low C = 19.9\n|Apr record low C = 19.4\n|May record low C = 18.5\n|Jun record low C = 17.6\n|Jul record low C = 17.0\n|Aug record low C = 17.2\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 17.8\n|Nov record low C = 17.0\n|Dec record low C = 18.0\n|year record low C = 15.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 200.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 332.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 315.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 207.7\n|May precipitation mm = 62.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 34.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 15.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 1.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 1.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 5.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 29.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 68.0\n|year precipitation mm = 1263.2\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 14\n|Mar precipitation days = 15\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 4\n|Jun precipitation days = 1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 0\n|Oct precipitation days = 1\n|Nov precipitation days = 0\n|Dec precipitation days = 2\n|year precipitation days = 59\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=\"WMO\">{{cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=2048|title= World Weather Information Service - Guayaquil|accessdate=16 January 2016|publisher=Met Office}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-III/EQ/84203.TXT| title = WMO Normals - Guayaquil | accessdate =16 January 2016 | publisher = NOAA}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Food==\n[[File:Ceviche ecuador.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian ceviche, made of shrimp, lime and tomato sauce]]\nTypical Guayaquil cuisine includes mostly seafood dishes such as [[encebollado]], [[ceviche]], [[cazuela]], and encocado (shrimp or tuna with a coconut sauce and rice). \n\nDuring breakfast, [[Tostones|Patacones]] and bolon (fried plantain with cheese mashed and given a rounded shape) play a big role.

{"title_page": "Dungeons & Dragons controversies", "text_new": "'''''Dungeons & Dragons'' controversies''' concern the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''D&D''), which has received significant attention in the [[Mass media|media]] and in [[popular culture]]. The game has received negative coverage, especially during the game's early years in the early 1980s. Because the term ''D&D'' may be mistakenly used to refer to all types of role-playing games, some controversies regarding ''D&D'' actually pertain to role-playing games in general, or to the literary genre of [[fantasy]].\n\nPart of the controversies concern the game and its alleged impact on those who play it, while others concern business issues at the game's original publisher, [[TSR (company)|TSR]]. The game is now owned by [[Wizards of the Coast]].\n\n==Religious objections==\n[[File:Occult dnd.png|thumb|right|In ''Dark Dungeons'' by [[Jack T.

Later she converts to [[Christianity]] and rejects the game, burning the materials and avoiding [[Hell]], which is explicitly stated as the destination of all ''D&D'' players.]]\n\nAt various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (''D&D'') has received negative publicity for alleged or perceived promotion of such practices as [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], [[pornography]], and [[murder]]. Especially during the 1980s, certain religious groups accused the game of encouraging sorcery and the veneration of [[demon]]s.<ref name=\"panic\">{{cite journal |author=Waldron, David |title=Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right: Community Formation in Response to a Moral Panic |journal=[[Journal of Religion and Popular Culture]] |volume=9 |date=Spring 2005 |url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art9-roleplaying-print.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104131941/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art9-roleplaying-print.html|archivedate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Throughout the [[history of role-playing games]], many of these criticisms have not been aimed specifically at ''D&D'', but touch on the genre of [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]]s as a whole.\n\nThe concept of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' as Satanic was linked to the concept of [[Satanic ritual abuse]], in that both presumed the existence of large, organized Satanic cults and societies. Sources such as the ''Dark Dungeons'' tract from [[Chick tract|Chick Publications]] portray ''D&D'' as a recruitment tool for these organizations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp | title=Dark Dungeons | year=1984 | publisher=Jack T.

Egbert had attempted suicide in the [[utility tunnel]]s beneath the campus of [[Michigan State University]]. After this unsuccessful attempt, he hid at a friend's house for approximately a month.\n\nA well-publicized search for Egbert began, and his parents hired private investigator William Dear to seek out their son.  Dear knew nothing about ''Dungeons & Dragons'' at that time, but speculated to the press that Egbert had gotten lost in the steam tunnels during a session of a [[live action role-playing game]]. The press largely reported the story as fact, which served as the kernel of a persistent rumor regarding such \"steam tunnel incidents\".  Egbert's suicide attempts, including his suicide completion the following year (by self-inflicted gunshot) had no connection whatsoever to ''D&D''; they resulted from [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] and great stress.<ref name=\"dmbook\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dear|first=William|title=The Dungeon Master: The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc5LoP8h64kC|year=1985|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-32695-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Rona Jaffe]] published ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]'' in 1981, a thinly disguised fictionalization of the press exaggerations of the Egbert case.  In an era when very few people understood role-playing games it seemed plausible to some elements of the public that a player might experience a psychotic episode and lose touch with reality during role-playing.  The book was adapted into a [[Mazes and Monsters|made-for-television movie]] in 1982 starring [[Tom Hanks]], and the publicity surrounding both the novel and film heightened the public's unease regarding role-playing games.  In 1983, the Canadian film ''[[Skullduggery (1983 film)|Skullduggery]]'' depicted a role-playing game similar to ''D&D'' as tool of the devil to transform a young man into a serial killer.\n\nDear revealed the truth of the incident in his 1984 book ''[[The Dungeon Master]]'', in which he repudiated the link between ''D&D'' and Egbert's disappearance.  Dear acknowledged that Egbert's domineering mother had more to do with his problems than his interest in role-playing games.<ref name=\"dmbook\" />\n\n[[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1984 novel satirizing university life, ''[[The Big U]]'', includes a series of similar incidents in which a live-action fantasy role-player dies in a steam tunnel accident, leading to another gamer becoming mentally unstable and unable to distinguish reality from the game.\n\n===Patricia Pulling===\n{{Main|Patricia Pulling}}\nPatricia Pulling was an anti-occult campaigner from [[Richmond, Virginia]] and the founder of Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons (BADD).  This one-person advocacy group was dedicated to the elimination of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and other such games. Pulling founded BADD in 1982 after her son Irving committed suicide; she continued her advocacy until her death in 1997. As her son had played ''D&D'', she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her son's high school principal, holding him responsible for what she claimed was a ''D&D'' curse placed upon her son shortly before his death.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} She later filed suit against TSR, publishers of the game at the time.<ref name=\"panic\"/>\n\nThe case against TSR was thrown out in 1984,<ref name=\"panic\"/> and most of her claims were disproved by reporters,<ref name=\"richmond\">{{cite news|title=Local Believers Short on Evidence|last=Springston|first=Rex|date=April 7, 1989|work=[[The Richmond News Leader]]|location=Richmond, Virginia}}</ref> especially [[Michael A.

Chris Pritchard, a student at [[North Carolina State University]], allegedly masterminded the murder of his stepfather, [[Lieth Von Stein]], for his $2 million fortune. Von Stein and his wife Bonnie (Pritchard's mother) were both bludgeoned and stabbed by a masked assailant in their bedroom, leaving the husband fatally wounded and the wife gravely injured.<ref name = \"McGinnis, 1991\">{{cite book | last = McGinniss | first = Joe | authorlink = Joe McGinniss | title = [[Cruel Doubt]] | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-671-67947-3 }}</ref>\n\nChris Pritchard had a history of mutual antagonism with his stepfather, and investigators learned over the course of a year that Pritchard had become involved with drugs and alcohol while attending NCSU.<ref name=\"McGinnis, 1991\" /> But the authorities focused on his role-playing group after a game map depicting the Von Stein house turned up as physical evidence.  Pritchard's friends, Neal Henderson and James Upchurch, were implicated in a plot to help Pritchard kill his stepfather. All three young men went to state prison in 1990. Henderson and Pritchard have since been paroled. Upchurch's death sentence was commuted to life in 1992; he is serving his term.<ref name=voss>{{cite news|last1=Voss|first1=Mike|title=Pritchard to be paroled|url=http://www.thewashingtondailynews.com/2007/05/26/pritchard-to-be-paroled/|work=[[Washington Daily News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306210631/http://www.thewashingtondailynews.com/2007/05/26/pritchard-to-be-paroled|archivedate=March 6, 2017|date=26 May 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTrue crime authors [[Joe McGinniss]] and [[Jerry Bledsoe]] played up the role-playing angle. Much attention was given to Upchurch's influence and power as a [[Dungeon Master]]. Bledsoe's book, ''Blood Games'', was made into a TV movie, ''Honor Thy Mother'', in 1992. That same year, McGinniss' book was adapted into a two-part TV miniseries, ''[[Cruel Doubt]]'', directed by [[Yves Simoneau]]. Both television films depicted ''Dungeons & Dragons'' handbooks with artwork doctored to imply that they had inspired the murder.<ref name=\"escapistfaq\">[http://www.theescapist.com/faq_encyclopedia.htm#cruel Cruel Doubt] on The Escapist's FAQ</ref>\n\n===TSR's reaction===\nThe controversy led TSR to remove references to [[Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)|demons]], [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]], and other potentially controversial supernatural monsters from the 2nd Edition of ''AD&D'', published in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ward, James M |authorlink=Jim Ward (game designer) |title=The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them) |journal=Dragon |issue=154 |date=February 9, 1990 }}</ref> These terms were replaced by references to ''tanar'ri'' and ''baatezu''. Many of these exclusions were returned to the 2nd Edition in the late 1990s, appearing again in releases such as ''[[Guide to Hell]]''. In 2000, the 3rd Edition of the game released by [[Wizards of the Coast]] (WotC) addressed demonology and demonolatry far more explicitly than materials from previous editions; however, relations and interactions with these creatures are explicitly said to be evil. The more \"extreme\" manuals, specifically the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' and the ''[[Book of Exalted Deeds]]'', bear a \"For Mature Audiences Only\" label.\n\n===Schnoebelen articles===\nWilliam Schnoebelen wrote a series of articles criticizing ''Dungeons & Dragons'' from a Christian perspective.

The article further accused the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' of celebrating [[Adolf Hitler]] for his charisma.<ref name=stdnd />\n\nSchnoebelen's second article focused on contrasting the Christian worldview and the fantasy worldview of ''D&D''.

Laycock, analyzing the controversy in his book ''Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds'' wrote that the gist of anti-D&D arguments were related to the fact that role-playing was perceived by some Christian philosophers and theologians as dangerous because it leads to critical thinking.

The policy went into effect based upon an anonymous letter from an inmate stating that the four prisoners that played the game were forming a \"gang\". When the ban took effect, the prison confiscated all ''D&D''-related materials. Inmate Kevin T. Singer, a dedicated player of the game, sentenced to a life term for first-degree [[homicide]], sought to overturn the ban, saying it violated his First Amendment rights.

The game has received negative coverage, especially during the game's early years in the early 1980s. Because the term ''D&D'' may be mistakenly used to refer to all types of role-playing games, some controversies regarding ''D&D'' actually pertain to role-playing games in general, or to the literary genre of [[fantasy]].\n\nPart of the controversies concern the game and its alleged impact on those who play it, while others concern business issues at the game's original publisher, [[TSR (company)|TSR]].

Egbert had attempted suicide in the [[utility tunnel]]s beneath the campus of [[Michigan State University]]. After this unsuccessful attempt, he hid at a friend's house for approximately a month.\n\nA well-publicized search for Egbert began, and his parents hired private investigator William Dear to seek out their son.  Dear knew nothing about ''Dungeons & Dragons'' at that time, but speculated to the press that Egbert had gotten lost in the steam tunnels during a session of a [[live action role-playing game]]. The press largely reported the story as fact, which served as the kernel of a persistent rumor regarding such \"steam tunnel incidents\".  Egbert's suicide attempts, including his suicide completion the following year (by self-inflicted gunshot) had no connection whatsoever to ''D&D''; they resulted from [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] and great stress.<ref name=\"dmbook\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dear|first=William|title=The Dungeon Master: The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc5LoP8h64kC|year=1985|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-32695-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Rona Jaffe]] published ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]'' in 1981, a thinly disguised fictionalization of the press exaggerations of the Egbert case.  In an era when very few people understood role-playing games it seemed plausible to some elements of the public that a player might experience a psychotic episode and lose touch with reality during role-playing.  The book was adapted into a [[Mazes and Monsters|made-for-television movie]] in 1982 starring [[Tom Hanks]], and the publicity surrounding both the novel and film heightened the public's unease regarding role-playing games.  In 1983, the Canadian film ''[[Skullduggery (1983 film)|Skullduggery]]'' depicted a role-playing game similar to ''D&D'' as tool of the devil to transform a young man into a serial killer.\n\nDear revealed the truth of the incident in his 1984 book ''[[The Dungeon Master]]'', in which he repudiated the link between ''D&D'' and Egbert's disappearance.  Dear acknowledged that Egbert's domineering mother had more to do with his problems than his interest in role-playing games.<ref name=\"dmbook\" />\n\n[[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1984 novel satirizing university life, ''[[The Big U]]'', includes a series of similar incidents in which a live-action fantasy role-player dies in a steam tunnel accident, leading to another gamer becoming mentally unstable and unable to distinguish reality from the game.\n\n===Patricia Pulling===\n{{Main|Patricia Pulling}}\nPatricia Pulling was an anti-occult campaigner from [[Richmond, Virginia]] and the founder of Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons (BADD).  This one-person advocacy group was dedicated to the elimination of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and other such games. Pulling founded BADD in 1982 after her son Irving committed suicide; she continued her advocacy until her death in 1997. As her son had played ''D&D'', she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her son's high school principal, holding him responsible for what she claimed was a ''D&D'' curse placed upon her son shortly before his death.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} She later filed suit against TSR, publishers of the game at the time.<ref name=\"panic\"/>\n\nThe case against TSR was thrown out in 1984,<ref name=\"panic\"/> and most of her claims were disproved by reporters,<ref name=\"richmond\">{{cite news|title=Local Believers Short on Evidence|last=Springston|first=Rex|date=April 7, 1989|work=[[The Richmond News Leader]]|location=Richmond, Virginia}}</ref> especially [[Michael A.

That same year, McGinniss' book was adapted into a two-part TV miniseries, ''[[Cruel Doubt]]'', directed by [[Yves Simoneau]].

However, on January 25, 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the ban as a \"reasonable policy\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Scott | last=Bauer | date=January 25, 2010 | title=Game over: Wisconsin inmate loses legal fight to play Dungeons & Dragons behind bars | work=Chicago Tribune | publisher=Tribune Co. | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-us-odd-dungeons-and-dragons-inmate,0,6644834.story?obref=obnetwork | accessdate=January 28, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Business disputes at TSR==\n{{See also|TSR (company)|Gary Gygax}}\nThe game's commercial success led to [[lawsuit]]s initiated in 1979 regarding distribution of [[royalty payment]]s between ''D&D'' co-creators [[Dave Arneson]] and [[Gary Gygax]]. Specifically at issue were the royalties for ''AD&D'', a product for which TSR did not acknowledge Arneson's [[intellectual property]] claims. Those suits were settled out of court by 1981.<ref>{{cite journal| title =Interview with Dave Arneson| journal =[[Pegasus (game magazine)|Pegasus]]| issue =1| page =4|editor1=Harold Kahn |editor2=Mike Reagan | publisher =[[Judges Guild]]| date =April\u2013May 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =Rausch| first =Allen| title =Dave Arneson Interview| publisher =[[GameSpy]]| date =August 19, 2004| url = http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/540/540395p1.html| accessdate = February 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\nGygax became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR and disputes related to the company's deteriorating [[corporate finance|financial]] situation in the early 1980s.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s mythical [[Middle-earth]] were removed or altered due to intellectual property concerns. For example, TSR replaced all references to the character race of [[Hobbit]]s in ''D&D'' with their alternate name, [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|Halflings]]\u2014which was coined by Tolkien but judged by TSR to be non-infringing. In the first edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of hobbit to \"halfling\", [[ent]] to \"[[treant]]\", and [[balrog]] to \"[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|Type VI demon]] [balor]\".<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J.R.R.

These problems were ultimately resolved by excising the material from later editions of the book.<ref>{{cite web| title =The Acaeum page on Deities & Demigods| url =http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/deities.html| accessdate = February 21, 2007 }} shows contents of different printings.</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, Hasbro filed a lawsuit against [[Atari]], claiming Atari had breached their ''Dungeons & Dragons'' licensing agreement when Atari sold its European distribution business to [[Namco Bandai Partners]]. Atari was accused of sub-licensing part of its exclusive ''D&D'' rights to Namco Bandai Partners without authorization. Hasbro also alleged Namco Bandai had obtained Hasbro's confidential information about ''D&D'' from Atari, and that Namco Bandai had posed as a ''D&D'' publisher for digital games previously published by Atari. In addition, the plaintiff claimed Atari had sold at least four of its subsidiaries actively engaged in ''D&D'' licensed activities to Namco Bandai while denying any relationship between itself and Namco Bandai with respect to ''D&D''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/12/has-atari-gone-chaotic-evil-over-dd-dd-franchise/|title=Has Atari gone Chaotic Evil over D&D publishing rights?|publisher=}}</ref> Atari claimed Hasbro tried to unfairly take back rights granted to Atari, and has sought to resolve the matter without cooperation from Hasbro.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5428864/hasbro-sues-atari-over-dd-license-atari-responds |title=Hasbro Sues Atari Over ''D&D'' License, Atari Responds |access-date=October 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824042816/http://kotaku.com/5428864/hasbro-sues-atari-over-dd-license-atari-responds |archive-date=August 24, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On August 15, 2011, Wizards of the Coast, Hasbro, and Atari announced the settlement and resolution of the complaint against Atari and the counterclaims filed by Atari against Hasbro.

Atari would continue to develop and market several games under license from Hasbro and Wizards, including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale]]'' and ''Heroes of Neverwinter'' for Facebook. In addition, as a result of the sales of Cryptic Studio to Perfect World Entertainment Inc., the release date of the ''[[Neverwinter (video game)|Neverwinter]]'' video game was delayed to late 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/ATA_DisputeResolutionHasbroWizards_20110815.pdf|title=HASBRO AND ATARI RESOLVE DUNGEONS & DRAGONS RIGHTS DISPUTE|access-date=October 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509134643/https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/ATA_DisputeResolutionHasbroWizards_20110815.pdf|archive-date=May 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112315-Atari-and-Hasbro-Settle-D-D-Lawsuit-Neverwinter-Delayed|title=Atari and Hasbro Settle D&D Lawsuit; Neverwinter Delayed|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of role-playing games]]\n*[[Moral panic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web | url=http://www.rpgstudies.net/ | title=Studies About Fantasy Role-Playing Games | publisher=RPGStudies.net | year=1994}}\n* {{cite web | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/d_a_d.htm | title=Dungeons and Dragons and other fantasy role-playing games | publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance | year=2002}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Dungeons & Dragons'' controversies}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{D&D topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dungeons and Dragons controversies}}\n[[Category:Controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:Dungeons & Dragons|Controversies]]\n", "name_user": "MysticDjinn", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_controversies"}
