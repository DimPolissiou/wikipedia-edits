It is one of four schools that comprise the Nova Center for Applied Research and Professional Development, the others being Nova Eisenhower Elementary School, Nova Blanche Forman Elementary School, and Nova Middle School. Nova Eisenhower Elementary, the newest of the three lower schools, began in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, in the old Fort Lauderdale High School building, while the current facility was being built in Davie.\n\nThe Nova campus is located within the South Florida Education Center, a consortium of area institutions which include the main campuses of [[Nova Southeastern University]], [[Broward College]], and the [[McFatter Technical Center]], as well as regional campuses of the [[University of Florida]] and [[Florida Atlantic University]]. The school has been named a [[Blue Ribbon School of Excellence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |title=Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982\u20131983 Through 1999\u20132002 (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> and has earned a [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test|FCAT]] school grade of \"''A''\" every year since 1999, with only one \"B\" grade in the 2002-2003 year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |title=FCAT School Grades \u2013 High |publisher=Browardschools.com |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618170802/http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nNova High School was established in 1960, and opened in September 1963, as a joint project between the Broward County Public Schools and [[Ford Foundation]]. Known as the Nova Educational Experiment, the project aimed to create a community of schools spanning elementary to university level education in one location.  Forman Field, the 545 acre site of a vacated naval aviation facility and located in the then rural areas of Broward County was chosen as the site for the project.<ref>http://grove.ufl.edu/~turf/flrec/history.html</ref>\n\nThe Nova schools were originally jointly funded by the Ford Foundation and local sources, and were known for their progressive curricula and use of experimental teaching methods.  Students were required to pass an entrance exam for acceptance and a lengthy waiting list often existed for potential students. The school year consisted of eleven months of instruction, with a one-month summer break.\n\nNova was the [[user acceptance testing|beta testing]] site for \"Propaganda\" and a number of other [[academic games]]. The earliest national academic games tournaments were held on the Nova campus during the late 1960s.\n\nAfter the Nova Educational Experiment ended in the 1970s, the Ford Foundation departed and total control of the Nova schools reverted to the Broward County Public Schools.  Entrance requirements were relaxed, however, as of 1985, placement on a waiting list for entry into the schools was still required.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the schools' special status had begun to chafe within the workings of the school board. School board movements to close or consolidate the schools resulted in heated contention between parents, students and the board, often accompanied by noisy public meetings.\n\nThe Nova schools have consistently ranked at the very top of schools in the state.  Nova High School was ranked as the 237th best public high school in the United States, 36th best in Florida, by [[Newsweek]] Magazine in 2007 and is listed as a Silver Medal School by the [[U.S. News & World Report]] in 2008, placing it within the top 3% of all high schools in the country.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 America's Top Public High Schools | Newsweek Best High Schools | Newsweek.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201151836/http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 |date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/directories/high-schools/index_html/state_id+FL/page_number+3/page_size+10/sort+alpha/name+/award+/school_name+/county+/detail+less Best High Schools Search \u2013 US News and World Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School is also well known for its extensive course offerings, including 22 [[Advanced Placement]] courses.  Nova graduates consistently matriculate to some of the finest colleges and universities in Florida and throughout the country.\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of 2014, the total student enrollment was 2149. The [[ethnic group|ethnic makeup]] of the school was 26% [[White people|White]], 44.2% [[Black people|Black]], 20.8% [[Hispanic]], 5.9% [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander]], 2.65% [[Multiracial]], and .32% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]].<ref>[https://webapp.browardschools.com/schoolsplash/20daycount.asp?school=1281 Enrollment Counts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School was awarded a grade of \"A\" by the [[Florida Department of Education]] in 2002\u20132003, 2004\u20132013.  On the 2007 norm-referenced [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]] (FCAT), Nova students performed nationally at the 75th percentile in reading and 82nd percentile in math.  Nova faculty have, on average, 12 years of teaching experience and 49% hold advanced degrees.  Average class size is 25 and the student stability rate is 97%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/fl/301 |title=Nova High School \u2013 Davie, Florida \u2013 FL \u2013 school overview |publisher=Greatschools.net |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== County-sanctioned athletic programs ===\n\n* Basketball (Boys' and Girls')\n* Baseball (Boys')\n* Bowling\n* [[Cross country running|Cross Country]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Diving (sport)|Diving]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[American football]] (Boys')\n* [[Flag football]] (Girls')\n* Soccer (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Swimming (sport)]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Diving (sport)]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* Track and Field (Boys' and Girls')\n* Tennis (Boys' and Girls')\n* Softball (Girls')\n* Volleyball (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Scholastic wrestling|Wrestling]] (Boys')\n* [[Water Polo]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Golf Team]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Step Team]] (Boys' and Girls')\n*Cheerleading\n\n=== Debate team ===\nThe Nova High School debate team is one of the top four largest teams in the United States, with its National Forensic League rating consistently wavering between fourth and sixth in the country. The team is also the largest and most winning team in the NFL Manatee District (the second biggest district in the country according to the February 2011 Rostrum Magazine), the most successful in Florida, and the top-ranked team in the Southeast United States. Nova is well known for its sweepstakes wins at national tournaments like the Yale Invitational, the Glenbrooks Tournament in Chicago, the Emory Barkley Forum, the Harvard Invitational, and more; this is in addition to consistently winning first place overall at state and regional tournaments such as the [[Florida Blue Key|University of Florida Blue Key]] Tournament, the Crestian Classic, the Sunvitational, and the Florida Forensic League Varsity State Tournament. The Nova High School debate team also has the third most invitees to the prestigious [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] Extemporaneous Speaking Round Robin, behind Newton South High School (Massachusetts) and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Iowa). Moreover, the performance of Nova High at the NFL National Tournament each June is evidently a testament to the team's national standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/schoolprofile.php?id=3733 |title=National Forensic League |publisher=Nflonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The team has seven National Champions since 2000: Jeff Hannan in Student Congress, Gregory Bernstein in Student Congress Scott Jacobson in Student Congress, Matt Futch in Student Congress, Allison Pena in Extemp Commentary, and in 2011 \u2013 Jamaque Newberry in Dramatic Interpretation, Jared Odessky in Domestic Extemperaneous Speaking, and Gregory Bernstein in Congressional Debate in both 2012 and 2013.  In 2013 the team was also one of only three in the nation to win overall excellence at Nationals. In 2017 Rafey Khan and Cornelia Fraser placed first in nationals in Public Form.\n\n=== Baseball team ===\nCoach Pat McQuaid has led the Nova Titans baseball team for 42 years. To honor the coach's service to the school, the baseball field was named Pat McQuaid Field. Recent accomplishments include state championships in 2004 and 2005. In each of those years, the Titans were ranked #1 in the nation by both [[Baseball America]] and [[Collegiate Baseball]]. In April 2010, Coach McQuaid was inducted into the F.H.S.A.A. (Florida High School Athletic Association) Hall of Fame for his lifelong contribution to coaching high school baseball in the State of Florida.\n\nFormer Nova High School players to see game time with a Major League Baseball team include [[Doug Johns]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Oakland Athletics]]), [[Harry Chappas]] ([[Chicago White Sox]]), [[Michael Morse]] ([[San Francisco Giants]]), [[Jeff Fiorentino]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]]), and [[Anthony Swarzak]] ([[Minnesota Twins]]).\n\n=== Swim, dive, and water polo teams ===\nSince 1968, Nova High School's Swim, Dive, and Water Polo Teams have earned 1 National Record, 1 National Champion, 183 All-Americans, 8 National Scholar Team Awards, 7 Team State Championships (12-Time Runner-up), and 58 Individual State Titles. From 2006 to 2015.\n\n=== Drama club ===\nNova High School's Drama Club has participated in the Florida State Thespian Festival and received Excellents and Superiors. The Weight of Words is an anti-bullying show written by Nova High students and the Lovewell Institute, and performed throughout Florida by current students enrolled in the Acting class.

It is one of four schools that comprise the Nova Center for Applied Research and Professional Development, the others being Nova Eisenhower Elementary School, Nova Blanche Forman Elementary School, and Nova Middle School. Nova Eisenhower Elementary, the newest of the three lower schools, began in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, in the old Fort Lauderdale High School building, while the current facility was being built in Davie.\n\nThe Nova campus is located within the South Florida Education Center, a consortium of area institutions which include the main campuses of [[Nova Southeastern University]], [[Broward College]], and the [[McFatter Technical Center]], as well as regional campuses of the [[University of Florida]] and [[Florida Atlantic University]]. The school has been named a [[Blue Ribbon School of Excellence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |title=Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982\u20131983 Through 1999\u20132002 (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> and has earned a [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test|FCAT]] school grade of \"''A''\" every year since 1999, with only one \"B\" grade in the 2002-2003 year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |title=FCAT School Grades \u2013 High |publisher=Browardschools.com |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618170802/http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nNova High School was established in 1960, and opened in September 1963, as a joint project between the Broward County Public Schools and [[Ford Foundation]]. Known as the Nova Educational Experiment, the project aimed to create a community of schools spanning elementary to university level education in one location.  Forman Field, the 545 acre site of a vacated naval aviation facility and located in the then rural areas of Broward County was chosen as the site for the project.<ref>http://grove.ufl.edu/~turf/flrec/history.html</ref>\n\nThe Nova schools were originally jointly funded by the Ford Foundation and local sources, and were known for their progressive curricula and use of experimental teaching methods.  Students were required to pass an entrance exam for acceptance and a lengthy waiting list often existed for potential students. The school year consisted of eleven months of instruction, with a one-month summer break.\n\nNova was the [[user acceptance testing|beta testing]] site for \"Propaganda\" and a number of other [[academic games]]. The earliest national academic games tournaments were held on the Nova campus during the late 1960s.\n\nAfter the Nova Educational Experiment ended in the 1970s, the Ford Foundation departed and total control of the Nova schools reverted to the Broward County Public Schools.  Entrance requirements were relaxed, however, as of 1985, placement on a waiting list for entry into the schools was still required.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the schools' special status had begun to chafe within the workings of the school board. School board movements to close or consolidate the schools resulted in heated contention between parents, students and the board, often accompanied by noisy public meetings.\n\nThe Nova schools have consistently ranked at the very top of schools in the state.  Nova High School was ranked as the 237th best public high school in the United States, 36th best in Florida, by [[Newsweek]] Magazine in 2007 and is listed as a Silver Medal School by the [[U.S. News & World Report]] in 2008, placing it within the top 3% of all high schools in the country.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 America's Top Public High Schools | Newsweek Best High Schools | Newsweek.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201151836/http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 |date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/directories/high-schools/index_html/state_id+FL/page_number+3/page_size+10/sort+alpha/name+/award+/school_name+/county+/detail+less Best High Schools Search \u2013 US News and World Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School is also well known for its extensive course offerings, including 22 [[Advanced Placement]] courses.  Nova graduates consistently matriculate to some of the finest colleges and universities in Florida and throughout the country.\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of 2014, the total student enrollment was 2149. The [[ethnic group|ethnic makeup]] of the school was 26% [[White people|White]], 44.2% [[Black people|Black]], 20.8% [[Hispanic]], 5.9% [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander]], 2.65% [[Multiracial]], and .32% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]].<ref>[https://webapp.browardschools.com/schoolsplash/20daycount.asp?school=1281 Enrollment Counts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School was awarded a grade of \"A\" by the [[Florida Department of Education]] in 2002\u20132003, 2004\u20132013.  On the 2007 norm-referenced [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]] (FCAT), Nova students performed nationally at the 75th percentile in reading and 82nd percentile in math.  Nova faculty have, on average, 12 years of teaching experience and 49% hold advanced degrees.  Average class size is 25 and the student stability rate is 97%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/fl/301 |title=Nova High School \u2013 Davie, Florida \u2013 FL \u2013 school overview |publisher=Greatschools.net |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== County-sanctioned athletic programs ===\n\n* Basketball (Boys' and Girls')\n* Baseball (Boys')\n* Bowling\n* [[Cross country running|Cross Country]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Diving (sport)|Diving]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[American football]] (Boys')\n* [[Flag football]] (Girls')\n* Soccer (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Swimming (sport)]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Diving (sport)]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* Track and Field (Boys' and Girls')\n* Tennis (Boys' and Girls')\n* Softball (Girls')\n* Volleyball (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Scholastic wrestling|Wrestling]] (Boys')\n* [[Water Polo]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Golf Team]] (Boys' and Girls')\n* [[Step Team]] (Boys' and Girls')\n*Cheerleading\n\n=== Debate team ===\nThe Nova High School debate team is one of the top four largest teams in the United States, with its National Forensic League rating consistently wavering between fourth and sixth in the country. The team is also the largest and most winning team in the NFL Manatee District (the second biggest district in the country according to the February 2011 Rostrum Magazine), the most successful in Florida, and the top-ranked team in the Southeast United States. Nova is well known for its sweepstakes wins at national tournaments like the Yale Invitational, the Glenbrooks Tournament in Chicago, the Emory Barkley Forum, the Harvard Invitational, and more; this is in addition to consistently winning first place overall at state and regional tournaments such as the [[Florida Blue Key|University of Florida Blue Key]] Tournament, the Crestian Classic, the Sunvitational, and the Florida Forensic League Varsity State Tournament. The Nova High School debate team also has the third most invitees to the prestigious [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] Extemporaneous Speaking Round Robin, behind Newton South High School (Massachusetts) and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Iowa). Moreover, the performance of Nova High at the NFL National Tournament each June is evidently a testament to the team's national standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/schoolprofile.php?id=3733 |title=National Forensic League |publisher=Nflonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The team has seven National Champions since 2000: Jeff Hannan in Student Congress, Gregory Bernstein in Student Congress Scott Jacobson in Student Congress, Matt Futch in Student Congress, Allison Pena in Extemp Commentary, and in 2011 \u2013 Jamaque Newberry in Dramatic Interpretation, Jared Odessky in Domestic Extemperaneous Speaking, and Gregory Bernstein in Congressional Debate in both 2012 and 2013.  In 2013 the team was also one of only three in the nation to win overall excellence at Nationals. In 2017 Rafey Khan and Cornelia Fraser placed first in nationals in Public Form.\n\n=== Baseball team ===\nCoach Pat McQuaid has led the Nova Titans baseball team for 42 years. To honor the coach's service to the school, the baseball field was named Pat McQuaid Field. Recent accomplishments include state championships in 2004 and 2005. In each of those years, the Titans were ranked #1 in the nation by both [[Baseball America]] and [[Collegiate Baseball]]. In April 2010, Coach McQuaid was inducted into the F.H.S.A.A. (Florida High School Athletic Association) Hall of Fame for his lifelong contribution to coaching high school baseball in the State of Florida.\n\nFormer Nova High School players to see game time with a Major League Baseball team include [[Doug Johns]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Oakland Athletics]]), [[Harry Chappas]] ([[Chicago White Sox]]), [[Michael Morse]] ([[San Francisco Giants]]), [[Jeff Fiorentino]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]]), and [[Anthony Swarzak]] ([[Minnesota Twins]]).\n\n=== Swim, dive, and water polo teams ===\nSince 1968, Nova High School's Swim, Dive, and Water Polo Teams have earned 1 National Record, 1 National Champion, 183 All-Americans, 8 National Scholar Team Awards, 7 Team State Championships (12-Time Runner-up), and 58 Individual State Titles. From 2006 to 2015.\n\n=== Drama club ===\nNova High School's Drama Club has participated in the Florida State Thespian Festival and received Excellents and Superiors. The Weight of Words is an anti-bullying show written by Nova High students and the Lovewell Institute, and performed throughout Florida by current students enrolled in the Acting class.

The territory was reconquered in 1692 by Don [[Diego de Vargas]] through the war campaign called the \"Bloodless Reconquest\" which was criticized as violent even at the time, it was actually the following governor [[Francisco Cuervo y Valdez]] that truly started to broker peace, such as the founding of [[Albuquerque]], to guarantee better representation and trade access for Pueblos in New Mexico's government. Other governors of New Mexico, such as [[Tom\u00e1s V\u00e9lez Cachupin]], continued to be better known for their more forward thinking work with the indigenous population of New Mexico. Santa Fe was Spain's provincial seat at outbreak of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1810. It was considered important to [[fur trade]]rs based in present-day [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]. When the area was still under Spanish rule, the Chouteau brothers of Saint Louis gained a monopoly on the fur trade, before the United States acquired Missouri under the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. The fur trade contributed to the wealth of St. Louis. The city's status as the capital of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico was formalized in the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]] after Mexico achieved independence from Spain.\n\nWhen the [[Republic of Texas]] seceded from Mexico in 1836, it attempted to claim Santa Fe and other parts of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] as part of the western portion of Texas along the [[Rio Grande|R\u00edo Grande]].

It suffered gradual economic decline into the early 20th century. Activists created a number of resources for the arts and [[archaeology]], notably the [[School of American Research]], created in 1907 under the leadership of the prominent archaeologist [[Edgar Lee Hewett]]. In the early 20th century, Santa Fe became a base for numerous writers and artists. The first airplane to fly over Santa Fe was piloted by Rose Dugan, carrying [[Vera von Blumenthal]] as passenger. Together the two women started the development of the [[Pueblo Indian#Pottery|Pueblo Indian pottery]] industry, helping native women to market their wares. They contributed to the founding of the annual [[Santa Fe Indian Market]].\n\nIn 1912, New Mexico was admitted as the [[United States|United States of America]]'s 47th state, with Santa Fe as its capital.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====1912 plan====\nIn 1912, when the town's population was approximately 5,000 people, the city's civic leaders designed and enacted a sophisticated city plan that incorporated elements of the contemporary [[City Beautiful]] movement, city planning, and historic preservation. The latter was particularly influenced by similar movements in Germany. The plan anticipated limited future growth, considered the scarcity of water, and recognized the future prospects of suburban development on the outskirts. The planners foresaw that its development must be in harmony with the city's character.<ref>Harry Moul, and Linda Tigges, \"The Santa Fe 1912 City Plan: A 'City Beautiful' and City Planning Document,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review,'' Spring 1996, Vol. 71 Issue 2, pp 135\u2013155</ref>\n\n====Artists and tourists====\n[[File:1921 Fiesta, Santa Fe.jpg|thumb|1921 Fiesta parade, Santa Fe.

However, artists and writers, as well as retirees, were attracted to the cultural richness of the area, the beauty of the landscapes, and its dry climate. Local leaders began promoting the city as a tourist attraction. The city sponsored architectural restoration projects and erected new buildings according to traditional techniques and styles, thus creating the [[Pueblo Revival architecture|Santa Fe Style]].\n\n[[Edgar L. Hewett]], founder and first director of the [[School of American Research]] and the [[Museum of New Mexico]] in Santa Fe, was a leading promoter. He began the [[Santa Fe Fiesta]] in 1919 and the Southwest Indian Fair in 1922 (now known as the [[Indian Market]]). When Hewett tried to attract a summer program for Texas women, many artists rebelled, saying the city should not promote artificial tourism at the expense of its artistic culture. The writers and artists formed the Old Santa Fe Association and defeated the plan.<ref>Carter Jones Meyer, \"The Battle between 'Art' and 'Progress': Edgar L.

The fundamental principle was that the town be laid out around a central plaza. On its north side was the [[Palace of the Governors]], while on the east was the church that later became the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nAn important style implemented in planning the city was the radiating grid of streets centered on the central Plaza. Many were narrow and included small alley-ways, but each gradually merged into the more casual byways of the agricultural perimeter areas. As the city grew throughout the 19th century, the building styles evolved too, so that by statehood in 1912, the eclectic nature of the buildings caused it to look like \"Anywhere USA\".<ref>Hammett, p.14</ref> The city government realized that the economic decline, which had started more than twenty years before with the railway moving west and the federal government closing down Fort Marcy, might be reversed by the promotion of tourism.\n\n[[File:NewMexicoCathedralSantaFe.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]], built in 1869, pictured in 2004|alt=]]\n\nTo achieve that goal, the city created the idea of imposing a unified building style \u2013 the [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Spanish Pueblo Revival]] look, which was based on work done restoring the Palace of the Governors. The sources for this style came from the many defining features of local architecture: ''[[Viga (architecture)|vigas]]'' (rough, exposed beams that extrude through supporting walls, and are thus visible outside as well as inside the building) and ''canales'' (rain spouts cut into short parapet walls around flat roofs), features borrowed from many old adobe homes and churches built many years before and found in the Pueblos, along with the earth-toned look (reproduced in [[stucco]]) of the old adobe exteriors.\n\nAfter 1912 this style became official: all buildings were to be built using these elements. By 1930 there was a broadening to include the \"Territorial\", a style of the pre-statehood period which included the addition of ''portales'' (large, covered porches) and white-painted window and door pediments (and also sometimes [[terra cotta]] tiles on sloped roofs, but with flat roofs still dominating). The city had become \"different\". However, \"in the rush to pueblofy\"<ref>Hammett, p.15: \"They ripped off the cast-iron storefronts, tore down the gingerbread trim, took off the Victorian brackets and dentils ...\"</ref> Santa Fe, the city lost a great deal of its architectural history and eclecticism. Among the architects most closely associated with this new style are [[T. Charles Gaastra]] and [[John Gaw Meem]].\n\nBy an ordinance passed in 1957, new and rebuilt buildings, especially those in designated historic districts, must exhibit a [[Territorial Revival architecture|Spanish Territorial]] or Pueblo style of architecture, with flat roofs and other features suggestive of the area's traditional [[adobe]] construction. However, many contemporary houses in the city are built from lumber, concrete blocks, and other common building materials, but with stucco surfaces (sometimes referred to as \"faux-dobe\", pronounced as one word: \"foe-dough-bee\") reflecting the historic style.\n\n[[File:NM 2.JPG|thumb|Homes are territorial- or [[pueblo]]-style and stuccoed with flat roofs, 2011.]]\n\nIn a September 2003 report by Angelou Economics, it was determined that Santa Fe should focus its economic development efforts in the following seven industries: Arts and Culture, Design, Hospitality, Conservation Technologies, Software Development, Publishing and New Media, and Outdoor Gear and Apparel. Three secondary targeted industries for Santa Fe to focus development in are health care, retiree services, and food & beverage. Angelou Economics recognized three economic signs that Santa Fe's economy was at risk of long-term deterioration. These signs were; a lack of business diversity which tied the city too closely to fluctuations in tourism and the government sector; the beginnings of urban sprawl, as a result of Santa Fe County growing faster than the city, meaning people will move farther outside the city to find land and lower costs for housing; and an aging population coupled with a rapidly shrinking population of individuals under 45 years old, making Santa Fe less attractive to business recruits. The seven industries recommended by the report \"represent a good mix for short-, mid-, and long-term economic cultivation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Cultivating Santa Fe's Future Economy: Target Industry Report|url=http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?NID=610|publisher=Angelou Economics|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111659/http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?NID=610|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005/2006, a consultant group from [[Portland, Oregon]], prepared a \"Santa Fe Downtown Vision Plan\" to examine the long-range needs for the \"downtown\" area, roughly bounded by the Paseo de Peralta on the north, south and east sides and by Guadalupe Street on the west.

They play their home games at Fort Marcy Park. [[Horse racing]] events were held at [[The Downs at Santa Fe]] from 1971 until 1997.\n\n===In musical theatre===\nThe illusion of the city of Santa Fe as compared to New York City has been depicted in the musicals ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]'' and ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''. Both contain songs called \"Santa Fe\" and fixate on the idea of Santa Fe as a place to escape, where the characters can be free from their pasts and the harshness of life in New York and embrace new lives. Additionally, both characters ultimately decide to stay in New York City because they realize their love of the city and its people, despite everything.\n\n==Science and technology==\nSanta Fe has had an association with science and technology since 1943 when the town served as the gateway to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL), a 45-minute drive from the city. In 1984, the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) was founded to research [[complex systems]] in the physical, biological, economic, and political sciences. It hosts such Nobel laureates as [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (physics), [[Philip Warren Anderson]] (physics), and [[Kenneth Arrow]] (economics).

In the 1990s and 2000s several technology companies formed to commercialize technologies from LANL, SFI and NCGR.\n\nDue to the presence of Los Alamos National Laboratory, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the Santa Fe Institute, and because of its attractiveness for visitors and an established tourist industry, Santa Fe routinely serves as a host to a variety of scientific meetings, summer schools, and public lectures, such as International q-bio Conference on Cellular Information Processing, Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/ |title=Complex Systems Summer School |publisher=Santafe.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605161933/http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/ |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> and LANL's Center For Nonlinear Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnls.lanl.gov |title=Center For Nonlinear Studies |access-date=2019-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006065436/http://cnls.lanl.gov/ |archive-date=2008-10-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> Annual Conference.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{quote|Touch the country [of New Mexico] and you will never be the same again.|[[D.

Other areas include \"Museum Hill\", the site of the major art museums of the city as well as the [[Santa Fe International Folk Art Market]], which takes place each year during the second full weekend of July. The Canyon Road arts area with its galleries is also a major attraction for locals and visitors alike.\n\nSome visitors find Santa Fe particularly attractive around the second week of September when the [[aspen]]s in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] turn yellow and the skies are clear and blue. This is also the time of the annual [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]], celebrating the \"reconquering\" of Santa Fe by [[Diego de Vargas|Don Diego de Vargas]], a highlight of which is the burning [[Zozobra]] (\"Old Man Gloom\"), a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[marionette]].\n\nPopular day trips in the Santa Fe area include locations such as the town of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], about {{convert|70|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Santa Fe.

The territory was reconquered in 1692 by Don [[Diego de Vargas]] through the war campaign called the \"Bloodless Reconquest\" which was criticized as violent even at the time, it was actually the following governor [[Francisco Cuervo y Valdez]] that truly started to broker peace, such as the founding of [[Albuquerque]], to guarantee better representation and trade access for Pueblos in New Mexico's government. Other governors of New Mexico, such as [[Tom\u00e1s V\u00e9lez Cachupin]], continued to be better known for their more forward thinking work with the indigenous population of New Mexico. Santa Fe was Spain's provincial seat at outbreak of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1810. It was considered important to [[fur trade]]rs based in present-day [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]. When the area was still under Spanish rule, the Chouteau brothers of Saint Louis gained a monopoly on the fur trade, before the United States acquired Missouri under the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. The fur trade contributed to the wealth of St. Louis. The city's status as the capital of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico was formalized in the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]] after Mexico achieved independence from Spain.\n\nWhen the [[Republic of Texas]] seceded from Mexico in 1836, it attempted to claim Santa Fe and other parts of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] as part of the western portion of Texas along the [[Rio Grande|R\u00edo Grande]]. In 1841, a small military and trading expedition set out from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], intending to take control of the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. Known as the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]], the force was poorly prepared and was easily captured by the New Mexican military.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Map_of_Mexico_1847.jpg|thumb|\"Mapa de los Estados Unidos de M\u00e9jico\", by John Distrunell, the 1847 map used during the negotiations of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]\n[[File:Santa fe nm 1846 47.jpg|thumb|Santa Fe, 1846\u20131847]]\n\nIn 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico.

By 1848 the U.S. officially gained New Mexico through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].\n\nColonel [[Alexander William Doniphan]], under the command of Kearny, recovered ammunition from Santa Fe labeled \"Spain 1776\" showing both the lack of communications and quality military support New Mexico received under Mexican rule.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Garrard |first=Lewis H. |title=Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail |location=Norman, Oklahoma |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1955 |origyear=1850 }}</ref>\n\nSome American visitors at first saw little promise in the remote town.

During his leadership, he traveled to France, Rome, Tucson, Los Angeles, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Mexico City. He built the Santa Fe [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis Cathedral]] and shaped Catholicism in the region until his death in 1888.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Lamy of Santa Fe; A Biography'' (1975)</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[New Mexico Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], General [[Henry Hopkins Sibley|Henry Sibley]] occupied the city, flying the [[Confederate flag]] over Santa Fe for a few days in March 1862. Sibley was forced to withdraw after Union troops destroyed his logistical trains following the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]]. The [[Santa Fe National Cemetery]] was created by the federal government after the war in 1870 to inter the Union soldiers who died fighting there.\n\n[[File:Santa Fe, NM (1882).png|thumb|left|Santa Fe, 1882, the railroad era]]\n\nOn October 21, 1887, [[Anton Docher]], \"The Padre of Isleta\", went to [[New Mexico]] where he was ordained as a priest in the St Francis Cathedral of Santa Fe by Bishop [[Jean-Baptiste Salpointe]].

But as the tracks were constructed into New Mexico, the [[civil engineer]]s decided that it was more practical to go through [[Lamy, New Mexico|Lamy]], a town in [[Santa Fe County]] to the south of Santa Fe.

It suffered gradual economic decline into the early 20th century. Activists created a number of resources for the arts and [[archaeology]], notably the [[School of American Research]], created in 1907 under the leadership of the prominent archaeologist [[Edgar Lee Hewett]]. In the early 20th century, Santa Fe became a base for numerous writers and artists. The first airplane to fly over Santa Fe was piloted by Rose Dugan, carrying [[Vera von Blumenthal]] as passenger. Together the two women started the development of the [[Pueblo Indian#Pottery|Pueblo Indian pottery]] industry, helping native women to market their wares. They contributed to the founding of the annual [[Santa Fe Indian Market]].\n\nIn 1912, New Mexico was admitted as the [[United States|United States of America]]'s 47th state, with Santa Fe as its capital.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====1912 plan====\nIn 1912, when the town's population was approximately 5,000 people, the city's civic leaders designed and enacted a sophisticated city plan that incorporated elements of the contemporary [[City Beautiful]] movement, city planning, and historic preservation. The latter was particularly influenced by similar movements in Germany. The plan anticipated limited future growth, considered the scarcity of water, and recognized the future prospects of suburban development on the outskirts. The planners foresaw that its development must be in harmony with the city's character.<ref>Harry Moul, and Linda Tigges, \"The Santa Fe 1912 City Plan: A 'City Beautiful' and City Planning Document,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review,'' Spring 1996, Vol. 71 Issue 2, pp 135\u2013155</ref>\n\n====Artists and tourists====\n[[File:1921 Fiesta, Santa Fe.jpg|thumb|1921 Fiesta parade, Santa Fe. [[Palace of the Governors]] in background.]]\n\nAfter the mainline of the railroad bypassed Santa Fe, it lost population. However, artists and writers, as well as retirees, were attracted to the cultural richness of the area, the beauty of the landscapes, and its dry climate. Local leaders began promoting the city as a tourist attraction. The city sponsored architectural restoration projects and erected new buildings according to traditional techniques and styles, thus creating the [[Pueblo Revival architecture|Santa Fe Style]].\n\n[[Edgar L. Hewett]], founder and first director of the [[School of American Research]] and the [[Museum of New Mexico]] in Santa Fe, was a leading promoter. He began the [[Santa Fe Fiesta]] in 1919 and the Southwest Indian Fair in 1922 (now known as the [[Indian Market]]). When Hewett tried to attract a summer program for Texas women, many artists rebelled, saying the city should not promote artificial tourism at the expense of its artistic culture. The writers and artists formed the Old Santa Fe Association and defeated the plan.<ref>Carter Jones Meyer, \"The Battle between 'Art' and 'Progress': Edgar L.

The fundamental principle was that the town be laid out around a central plaza. On its north side was the [[Palace of the Governors]], while on the east was the church that later became the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nAn important style implemented in planning the city was the radiating grid of streets centered on the central Plaza. Many were narrow and included small alley-ways, but each gradually merged into the more casual byways of the agricultural perimeter areas. As the city grew throughout the 19th century, the building styles evolved too, so that by statehood in 1912, the eclectic nature of the buildings caused it to look like \"Anywhere USA\".<ref>Hammett, p.14</ref> The city government realized that the economic decline, which had started more than twenty years before with the railway moving west and the federal government closing down Fort Marcy, might be reversed by the promotion of tourism.\n\n[[File:NewMexicoCathedralSantaFe.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]], built in 1869, pictured in 2004|alt=]]\n\nTo achieve that goal, the city created the idea of imposing a unified building style \u2013 the [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Spanish Pueblo Revival]] look, which was based on work done restoring the Palace of the Governors. The sources for this style came from the many defining features of local architecture: ''[[Viga (architecture)|vigas]]'' (rough, exposed beams that extrude through supporting walls, and are thus visible outside as well as inside the building) and ''canales'' (rain spouts cut into short parapet walls around flat roofs), features borrowed from many old adobe homes and churches built many years before and found in the Pueblos, along with the earth-toned look (reproduced in [[stucco]]) of the old adobe exteriors.\n\nAfter 1912 this style became official: all buildings were to be built using these elements. By 1930 there was a broadening to include the \"Territorial\", a style of the pre-statehood period which included the addition of ''portales'' (large, covered porches) and white-painted window and door pediments (and also sometimes [[terra cotta]] tiles on sloped roofs, but with flat roofs still dominating). The city had become \"different\". However, \"in the rush to pueblofy\"<ref>Hammett, p.15: \"They ripped off the cast-iron storefronts, tore down the gingerbread trim, took off the Victorian brackets and dentils ...\"</ref> Santa Fe, the city lost a great deal of its architectural history and eclecticism. Among the architects most closely associated with this new style are [[T. Charles Gaastra]] and [[John Gaw Meem]].\n\nBy an ordinance passed in 1957, new and rebuilt buildings, especially those in designated historic districts, must exhibit a [[Territorial Revival architecture|Spanish Territorial]] or Pueblo style of architecture, with flat roofs and other features suggestive of the area's traditional [[adobe]] construction. However, many contemporary houses in the city are built from lumber, concrete blocks, and other common building materials, but with stucco surfaces (sometimes referred to as \"faux-dobe\", pronounced as one word: \"foe-dough-bee\") reflecting the historic style.\n\n[[File:NM 2.JPG|thumb|Homes are territorial- or [[pueblo]]-style and stuccoed with flat roofs, 2011.]]\n\nIn a September 2003 report by Angelou Economics, it was determined that Santa Fe should focus its economic development efforts in the following seven industries: Arts and Culture, Design, Hospitality, Conservation Technologies, Software Development, Publishing and New Media, and Outdoor Gear and Apparel. Three secondary targeted industries for Santa Fe to focus development in are health care, retiree services, and food & beverage. Angelou Economics recognized three economic signs that Santa Fe's economy was at risk of long-term deterioration. These signs were; a lack of business diversity which tied the city too closely to fluctuations in tourism and the government sector; the beginnings of urban sprawl, as a result of Santa Fe County growing faster than the city, meaning people will move farther outside the city to find land and lower costs for housing; and an aging population coupled with a rapidly shrinking population of individuals under 45 years old, making Santa Fe less attractive to business recruits. The seven industries recommended by the report \"represent a good mix for short-, mid-, and long-term economic cultivation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Cultivating Santa Fe's Future Economy: Target Industry Report|url=http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?NID=610|publisher=Angelou Economics|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111659/http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?NID=610|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005/2006, a consultant group from [[Portland, Oregon]], prepared a \"Santa Fe Downtown Vision Plan\" to examine the long-range needs for the \"downtown\" area, roughly bounded by the Paseo de Peralta on the north, south and east sides and by Guadalupe Street on the west.

''The Magazine'' has been the arts magazine of Santa Fe since its founding by Guy Cross in 1992. It publishes critical reviews and profiles New Mexico based artists monthly. Each Wednesday the [[alternative weekly]] newspaper, the ''[[Santa Fe Reporter]]'', publishes information on the arts and culture of Santa Fe.\n\n===Music, dance, and opera===\n[[File:Santa Fe Opera interior view from section 10.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Crosby Theatre at the [[Santa Fe Opera]], viewed from the mezzanine in 2006|alt=]]\n\nPerformance Santa Fe, formerly the Santa Fe Concert Association, is the oldest presenting organization in Santa Fe.

The city also hosts the [[Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival]] which is held at about the same time, mostly in the [[St. Francis Auditorium]] and in the [[Lensic Theater]].  Also in July and August, the [[Santa Fe Desert Chorale]] holds its summer festival. Santa Fe has its own professional ballet company, [[Aspen Santa Fe Ballet]], which performs in both cities and tours nationally and internationally.  Santa Fe is also home to internationally acclaimed Flamenco dancer's [[Mar\u00eda Ben\u00edtez]] Institute for Spanish Arts which offers programs and performance in Flamenco, Spanish Guitar and similar arts year round.

They play their home games at Fort Marcy Park. [[Horse racing]] events were held at [[The Downs at Santa Fe]] from 1971 until 1997.\n\n===In musical theatre===\nThe illusion of the city of Santa Fe as compared to New York City has been depicted in the musicals ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]'' and ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''. Both contain songs called \"Santa Fe\" and fixate on the idea of Santa Fe as a place to escape, where the characters can be free from their pasts and the harshness of life in New York and embrace new lives. Additionally, both characters ultimately decide to stay in New York City because they realize their love of the city and its people, despite everything.\n\n==Science and technology==\nSanta Fe has had an association with science and technology since 1943 when the town served as the gateway to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL), a 45-minute drive from the city. In 1984, the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) was founded to research [[complex systems]] in the physical, biological, economic, and political sciences. It hosts such Nobel laureates as [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (physics), [[Philip Warren Anderson]] (physics), and [[Kenneth Arrow]] (economics).

In the 1990s and 2000s several technology companies formed to commercialize technologies from LANL, SFI and NCGR.\n\nDue to the presence of Los Alamos National Laboratory, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the Santa Fe Institute, and because of its attractiveness for visitors and an established tourist industry, Santa Fe routinely serves as a host to a variety of scientific meetings, summer schools, and public lectures, such as International q-bio Conference on Cellular Information Processing, Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/ |title=Complex Systems Summer School |publisher=Santafe.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605161933/http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/ |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> and LANL's Center For Nonlinear Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnls.lanl.gov |title=Center For Nonlinear Studies |access-date=2019-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006065436/http://cnls.lanl.gov/ |archive-date=2008-10-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> Annual Conference.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{quote|Touch the country [of New Mexico] and you will never be the same again.|[[D.

Other areas include \"Museum Hill\", the site of the major art museums of the city as well as the [[Santa Fe International Folk Art Market]], which takes place each year during the second full weekend of July. The Canyon Road arts area with its galleries is also a major attraction for locals and visitors alike.\n\nSome visitors find Santa Fe particularly attractive around the second week of September when the [[aspen]]s in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] turn yellow and the skies are clear and blue. This is also the time of the annual [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]], celebrating the \"reconquering\" of Santa Fe by [[Diego de Vargas|Don Diego de Vargas]], a highlight of which is the burning [[Zozobra]] (\"Old Man Gloom\"), a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[marionette]].\n\nPopular day trips in the Santa Fe area include locations such as the town of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], about {{convert|70|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Santa Fe.

It is one of four schools that comprise the Nova Center for Applied Research and Professional Development, the others being Nova Eisenhower Elementary School, Nova Blanche Forman Elementary School, and Nova Middle School. Nova Eisenhower Elementary, the newest of the three lower schools, began in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, in the old Fort Lauderdale High School building, while the current facility was being built in Davie.\n\nThe Nova campus is located within the South Florida Education Center, a consortium of area institutions which include the main campuses of [[Nova Southeastern University]], [[Broward College]], and the [[McFatter Technical Center]], as well as regional campuses of the [[University of Florida]] and [[Florida Atlantic University]]. The school has been named a [[Blue Ribbon School of Excellence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |title=Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982\u20131983 Through 1999\u20132002 (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> and has earned a [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test|FCAT]] school grade of \"''A''\" every year since 1999, with only one \"B\" grade in the 2002-2003 year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |title=FCAT School Grades \u2013 High |publisher=Browardschools.com |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618170802/http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nNova High School was established in 1960, and opened in September 1963, as a joint project between the Broward County Public Schools and [[Ford Foundation]]. Known as the Nova Educational Experiment, the project aimed to create a community of schools spanning elementary to university level education in one location.  Forman Field, the 545 acre site of a vacated naval aviation facility and located in the then rural areas of Broward County was chosen as the site for the project.<ref>http://grove.ufl.edu/~turf/flrec/history.html</ref>\n\nThe Nova schools were originally jointly funded by the Ford Foundation and local sources, and were known for their progressive curricula and use of experimental teaching methods.  Students were required to pass an entrance exam for acceptance and a lengthy waiting list often existed for potential students. The school year consisted of eleven months of instruction, with a one-month summer break.\n\nNova was the [[user acceptance testing|beta testing]] site for \"Propaganda\" and a number of other [[academic games]]. The earliest national academic games tournaments were held on the Nova campus during the late 1960s.\n\nAfter the Nova Educational Experiment ended in the 1970s, the Ford Foundation departed and total control of the Nova schools reverted to the Broward County Public Schools.  Entrance requirements were relaxed, however, as of 1985, placement on a waiting list for entry into the schools was still required.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the schools' special status had begun to chafe within the workings of the school board. School board movements to close or consolidate the schools resulted in heated contention between parents, students and the board, often accompanied by noisy public meetings.\n\nThe Nova schools have consistently ranked at the very top of schools in the state.  Nova High School was ranked as the 237th best public high school in the United States, 36th best in Florida, by [[Newsweek]] Magazine in 2007 and is listed as a Silver Medal School by the [[U.S. News & World Report]] in 2008, placing it within the top 3% of all high schools in the country.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 America's Top Public High Schools | Newsweek Best High Schools | Newsweek.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201151836/http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 |date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/directories/high-schools/index_html/state_id+FL/page_number+3/page_size+10/sort+alpha/name+/award+/school_name+/county+/detail+less Best High Schools Search \u2013 US News and World Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School is also well known for its extensive course offerings, including 22 [[Advanced Placement]] courses.  Nova graduates consistently matriculate to some of the finest colleges and universities in Florida and throughout the country.\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of 2014, the total student enrollment was 2149. The [[ethnic group|ethnic makeup]] of the school was 26% [[White people|White]], 44.2% [[Black people|Black]], 20.8% [[Hispanic]], 5.9% [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander]], 2.65% [[Multiracial]], and .32% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]].<ref>[https://webapp.browardschools.com/schoolsplash/20daycount.asp?school=1281 Enrollment Counts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School was awarded a grade of \"A\" by the [[Florida Department of Education]] in 2002\u20132003, 2004\u20132013.  On the 2007 norm-referenced [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]] (FCAT), Nova students performed nationally at the 75th percentile in reading and 82nd percentile in math.  Nova faculty have, on average, 12 years of teaching experience and 49% hold advanced degrees.

The team is also the largest and most winning team in the NFL Manatee District (the second biggest district in the country according to the February 2011 Rostrum Magazine), the most successful in Florida, and the top-ranked team in the Southeast United States. Nova is well known for its sweepstakes wins at national tournaments like the Yale Invitational, the Glenbrooks Tournament in Chicago, the Emory Barkley Forum, the Harvard Invitational, and more; this is in addition to consistently winning first place overall at state and regional tournaments such as the [[Florida Blue Key|University of Florida Blue Key]] Tournament, the Crestian Classic, the Sunvitational, and the Florida Forensic League Varsity State Tournament. The Nova High School debate team also has the third most invitees to the prestigious [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] Extemporaneous Speaking Round Robin, behind Newton South High School (Massachusetts) and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Iowa). Moreover, the performance of Nova High at the NFL National Tournament each June is evidently a testament to the team's national standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/schoolprofile.php?id=3733 |title=National Forensic League |publisher=Nflonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The team has seven National Champions since 2000: Jeff Hannan in Student Congress, Gregory Bernstein in Student Congress Scott Jacobson in Student Congress, Matt Futch in Student Congress, Allison Pena in Extemp Commentary, and in 2011 \u2013 Jamaque Newberry in Dramatic Interpretation, Jared Odessky in Domestic Extemperaneous Speaking, and Gregory Bernstein in Congressional Debate in both 2012 and 2013.  In 2013 the team was also one of only three in the nation to win overall excellence at Nationals. In 2017 Rafey Khan and Cornelia Fraser placed first in nationals in Public Form.\n\n=== Baseball team ===\nCoach Pat McQuaid has led the Nova Titans baseball team for 42 years. To honor the coach's service to the school, the baseball field was named Pat McQuaid Field. Recent accomplishments include state championships in 2004 and 2005.

It is one of four schools that comprise the Nova Center for Applied Research and Professional Development, the others being Nova Eisenhower Elementary School, Nova Blanche Forman Elementary School, and Nova Middle School. Nova Eisenhower Elementary, the newest of the three lower schools, began in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, in the old Fort Lauderdale High School building, while the current facility was being built in Davie.\n\nThe Nova campus is located within the South Florida Education Center, a consortium of area institutions which include the main campuses of [[Nova Southeastern University]], [[Broward College]], and the [[McFatter Technical Center]], as well as regional campuses of the [[University of Florida]] and [[Florida Atlantic University]]. The school has been named a [[Blue Ribbon School of Excellence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |title=Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982\u20131983 Through 1999\u20132002 (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> and has earned a [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test|FCAT]] school grade of \"''A''\" every year since 1999, with only one \"B\" grade in the 2002-2003 year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |title=FCAT School Grades \u2013 High |publisher=Browardschools.com |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618170802/http://www.browardschools.com/schools/fcat/high.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nNova High School was established in 1960, and opened in September 1963, as a joint project between the Broward County Public Schools and [[Ford Foundation]]. Known as the Nova Educational Experiment, the project aimed to create a community of schools spanning elementary to university level education in one location.  Forman Field, the 545 acre site of a vacated naval aviation facility and located in the then rural areas of Broward County was chosen as the site for the project.<ref>http://grove.ufl.edu/~turf/flrec/history.html</ref>\n\nThe Nova schools were originally jointly funded by the Ford Foundation and local sources, and were known for their progressive curricula and use of experimental teaching methods.  Students were required to pass an entrance exam for acceptance and a lengthy waiting list often existed for potential students. The school year consisted of eleven months of instruction, with a one-month summer break.\n\nNova was the [[user acceptance testing|beta testing]] site for \"Propaganda\" and a number of other [[academic games]]. The earliest national academic games tournaments were held on the Nova campus during the late 1960s.\n\nAfter the Nova Educational Experiment ended in the 1970s, the Ford Foundation departed and total control of the Nova schools reverted to the Broward County Public Schools.  Entrance requirements were relaxed, however, as of 1985, placement on a waiting list for entry into the schools was still required.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the schools' special status had begun to chafe within the workings of the school board. School board movements to close or consolidate the schools resulted in heated contention between parents, students and the board, often accompanied by noisy public meetings.\n\nThe Nova schools have consistently ranked at the very top of schools in the state.  Nova High School was ranked as the 237th best public high school in the United States, 36th best in Florida, by [[Newsweek]] Magazine in 2007 and is listed as a Silver Medal School by the [[U.S. News & World Report]] in 2008, placing it within the top 3% of all high schools in the country.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 America's Top Public High Schools | Newsweek Best High Schools | Newsweek.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201151836/http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=State&count=1236&start=0&limit=100&year=2007 |date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/directories/high-schools/index_html/state_id+FL/page_number+3/page_size+10/sort+alpha/name+/award+/school_name+/county+/detail+less Best High Schools Search \u2013 US News and World Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School is also well known for its extensive course offerings, including 22 [[Advanced Placement]] courses.  Nova graduates consistently matriculate to some of the finest colleges and universities in Florida and throughout the country.\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of 2014, the total student enrollment was 2149. The [[ethnic group|ethnic makeup]] of the school was 26% [[White people|White]], 44.2% [[Black people|Black]], 20.8% [[Hispanic]], 5.9% [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander]], 2.65% [[Multiracial]], and .32% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]].<ref>[https://webapp.browardschools.com/schoolsplash/20daycount.asp?school=1281 Enrollment Counts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNova High School was awarded a grade of \"A\" by the [[Florida Department of Education]] in 2002\u20132003, 2004\u20132013.  On the 2007 norm-referenced [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]] (FCAT), Nova students performed nationally at the 75th percentile in reading and 82nd percentile in math.  Nova faculty have, on average, 12 years of teaching experience and 49% hold advanced degrees.

The team is also the largest and most winning team in the NFL Manatee District (the second biggest district in the country according to the February 2011 Rostrum Magazine), the most successful in Florida, and the top-ranked team in the Southeast United States. Nova is well known for its sweepstakes wins at national tournaments like the Yale Invitational, the Glenbrooks Tournament in Chicago, the Emory Barkley Forum, the Harvard Invitational, and more; this is in addition to consistently winning first place overall at state and regional tournaments such as the [[Florida Blue Key|University of Florida Blue Key]] Tournament, the Crestian Classic, the Sunvitational, and the Florida Forensic League Varsity State Tournament. The Nova High School debate team also has the third most invitees to the prestigious [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] Extemporaneous Speaking Round Robin, behind Newton South High School (Massachusetts) and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Iowa). Moreover, the performance of Nova High at the NFL National Tournament each June is evidently a testament to the team's national standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/schoolprofile.php?id=3733 |title=National Forensic League |publisher=Nflonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The team has seven National Champions since 2000: Jeff Hannan in Student Congress, Gregory Bernstein in Student Congress Scott Jacobson in Student Congress, Matt Futch in Student Congress, Allison Pena in Extemp Commentary, and in 2011 \u2013 Jamaque Newberry in Dramatic Interpretation, Jared Odessky in Domestic Extemperaneous Speaking, and Gregory Bernstein in Congressional Debate in both 2012 and 2013.  In 2013 the team was also one of only three in the nation to win overall excellence at Nationals. In 2017 Rafey Khan and Cornelia Fraser placed first in nationals in Public Form.\n\n=== Baseball team ===\nCoach Pat McQuaid has led the Nova Titans baseball team for 42 years. To honor the coach's service to the school, the baseball field was named Pat McQuaid Field. Recent accomplishments include state championships in 2004 and 2005. In each of those years, the Titans were ranked #1 in the nation by both [[Baseball America]] and [[Collegiate Baseball]]. In April 2010, Coach McQuaid was inducted into the F.H.S.A.A. (Florida High School Athletic Association) Hall of Fame for his lifelong contribution to coaching high school baseball in the State of Florida.\n\nFormer Nova High School players to see game time with a Major League Baseball team include [[Doug Johns]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Oakland Athletics]]), [[Harry Chappas]] ([[Chicago White Sox]]), [[Michael Morse]] ([[San Francisco Giants]]), [[Jeff Fiorentino]] ([[Baltimore Orioles]]), and [[Anthony Swarzak]] ([[Minnesota Twins]]).\n\n=== Swim, dive, and water polo teams ===\nSince 1968, Nova High School's Swim, Dive, and Water Polo Teams have earned 1 National Record, 1 National Champion, 183 All-Americans, 8 National Scholar Team Awards, 7 Team State Championships (12-Time Runner-up), and 58 Individual State Titles. From 2006 to 2015.\n\n=== Drama club ===\nNova High School's Drama Club has participated in the Florida State Thespian Festival and received Excellents and Superiors.
