{"title_page": "Community of practice", "text_new": "{{Community}}\nA '''community of practice''' ('''CoP''') is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance{{Harv|Sheridan|2015}}. A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance{{Sheridan|2015}}. A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

Ohio State struck first, midway through the first quarter on a [[Curtis Samuel]] 36-yard touchdown run. On Oklahoma's next possession, Ohio State's Jerome Baker intercepted [[Baker Mayfield]]'s pass to score a touchdown on a 68-yard interception return. This was Ohio State's fourth defensive score in their first three games. During the ensuing kickoff, Oklahoma's Joe Mixon returned the kick for a 97-yard touchdown, to make the score 14\u20137, Ohio State. Though not caught, Mixon dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line and fumbled into the end zone. Ohio State scored another two touchdowns and Oklahoma made a field goal to make the score 28\u201310. With six minutes to go in the half, Oklahoma scored on a 35-yard Mayfield pass to A.D.

The Buckeye offense drove 75 yards to end the first half on a behind-the-back grab by [[Noah Brown]] to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201317 halftime advantage.\n\nOhio State scored on their opening possession of the half with Noah Brown's school record tying fourth touchdown reception.

In the previous meeting, Ohio State defeated Michigan for the fourth consecutive year, winning 42\u201313.<ref name=OhioStateNotes>{{cite news|title=Postgame Notes: #2 Ohio State 30, #3 Michigan 27 (2OT)|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112616aaa.html}}</ref>\n\nIn this year's game, the #2 Ohio State Buckeyes (11\u20131, 8\u20131) defeated the #3 Michigan Wolverines (10\u20132, 7\u20132) by a score of 30\u201327 in double overtime. After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State. The game marked the 11th time that Michigan and Ohio State took the field both in the nation's top-five rankings; and is just the second time that both programs were ranked in the nation's top three. The other was the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in [[2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|2006]] at Ohio Stadium. The game also marked the first overtime in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry. Michigan's defense recorded a season-best eight sacks against Ohio State. It is the program's most since posting nine against [[2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] on September 15, 2007. The Wolverines have recorded at least three sacks in each of the last four games. Wide receiver Amara Darboh surpassed the 2,000-yard receiving milestone in the contest. Darboh caught eight passes for 68 receiving yards, upping his career total to 2,026. Darboh has recorded a reception in 32 consecutive games, earning a share of the fourth spot among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category. He is tied with [[Marquise Walker]] (1998\u20132001).<ref name=OhioStateNotes/>\n\n[[Raekwon McMillan]] was named the conference Defensive Player of the Week for his performance. He recorded a career-tying 16 tackles, including seven solo stops.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|330\n|310\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|219\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|206\n|91\n|-\n|Penalties\n|2\u20136\n|7\u201359\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|28:47\n|31:13\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

With both teams ranked in the top ten of both major college football polls, [[ESPN]] had chosen [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as the host of [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]. This was Wisconsin's second appearance on GameDay for 2016 and Ohio State's first. Ohio State extended their current win streak over the Badgers to five, dating back to 2011. Ohio State coach [[Urban Meyer]] is 4\u20130 versus Wisconsin and this was Badgers' coach [[Paul Chryst]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes started the game off slow by gaining only 23 yards on their first two drives, both resulting in punts, while allowing 147 yards for the Badger's offense on their first two drives that resulted in a ten-point lead for #8 Wisconsin. Neither team could find the endzone for the remainder of the first half and both settled for two additional field goals apiece for a halftime score of 16\u20136 favoring the Badgers.\n\nThe Silver Bullet Buckeye defense came out strong in the second half forcing two Wisconsin turnovers and a three-and-out, on Wisconsin's first three possessions. Though the Buckeyes threw an interception on their first possession, they followed it up with two consecutive touchdowns, both [[J. T. Barrett]] runs. On Barrett's second touchdown, Ohio State took their first lead of the night at the 14:09 mark of the fourth quarter, and the Buckeyes led 20\u201316. The next drive, Wisconsin drove 81 yards to take back the lead with 7:54 left in the game. The Buckeyes followed that score with a field goal to tie the game at 23 with 3:57 to go. The Badger offense drove 25 yards on their last possession, but come up short of field goal range and had to punt to the Buckeyes with 0:14 left. The Buckeyes with the ball on their 17-yard line decided to run out the clock and force overtime.\n\nOhio State would get the ball first in overtime and would score a touchdown on a [[J. T. Barrett]] pass to Noah Brown on third and two from the Wisconsin 7, which gave them a 30\u201323 lead. On Wisconsin's attempt, quarterback Alex Hornibrook would throw a 21-yard pass on Wisconsin's second play which got the Badgers to the Ohio State 4. After two [[Corey Clement]] runs for no gain and an incomplete pass, the game came down to a fourth and goal from the Ohio State four. Wisconsin opted for a pass and Hornibrook was sacked by [[Tyquan Lewis]] to preserve Ohio State's unbeaten status.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led by Barrett who had 226 yards passing and 92 yards rushing and three total touchdowns (two rushing, one passing). Barrett was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his 318 total yard performance.<ref name=\"btn.com\">http://btn.com/2016/10/17/check-out-who-won-week-7-big-ten-football-honors/</ref> He was also named  Davey O\u2019Brien National Quarterback of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101816aae.html|title=J.T.

The game was played on Nov. 12, at 3:30 pm, in [[College Park, Maryland]] and was aired on [[ESPN College Football|ESPN]]. It was the third meeting between the teams with the Buckeyes being victorious in both previous games. The Buckeyes came in as 28-point favorites.\n\nOhio State came out of the gates quickly by scoring touchdowns on their first two offensive possessions while holding the Terrapins to \u22124 yards. Maryland mustered up a 23-yard field goal at the 2:03 mark of the first quarter and would not score the rest of the game. The Buckeyes would go on to score on five of their last six possessions of the first half and forcing two Maryland turnovers to close the half up 45\u20133.\n\nThe Buckeyes scored two more touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, while Maryland would not reach the Buckeye-side of the field.\n\nFollowing a chaotic week in football, the Buckeyes would jump to #2 in both the AP and Coaches Polls following their second straight 59-point victory.\n\n {{Clear}}\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|581\n|176\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|328\n|133\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|253\n|43\n|-\n|Penalties\n|6\u201355\n|7\u201374\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:45\n|28:15\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

Following Ohio State and Michigan State trading punts, Ohio State evened the score on a 5-play, 50-yard drive, capped by a 24-yard [[J. T.

Ohio State intercepted an O'Connor pass two plays later and drove the ball into the redzone. On third and three at the MSU 16, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] fumbled the ball giving Ohio State no chance to attempt a field goal. Ohio State and Michigan State went into halftime tied at ten.\n\nBoth teams punted twice to start the second half until Ohio State formed a four-play 69-yard drive that resulted in another touchdown, giving them a 17\u201310 advantage. The next score came from Michigan State on a 1-yard LJ Scott run. The Spartans opted to go for a two-point conversion with only 4:41 left in the game to attempt to take the lead. Tyler O'Connor's pass was intercepted in the end zone and the Buckeyes maintained the lead, 17\u201316.

After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| link1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)'''\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| link2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| caption2 = '''Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)'''\n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| link3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| caption3 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)'''\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar [[Viramadeva|Viramdeo]] were killed in a battle against [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Alauddin Khalji]] in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara.

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n[[File:Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg|left|thumb|Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya.[[File:Raja Shri Karan in battle at Chittor by Lalit C Sharma.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Raja Shree Karan in battle alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allaud-din-Khilji (1303) at Chittorgarh.

Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n<br/>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur.</ref>\n\n==Deora Chauhans embrace Jainism==\nAccording to Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh, written in 1593 by Jaysom,<blockquote>''\u201cAfter Rana Shree Karan's death in the battle, his wife Queen Ratna Devi along with her four sons - Samdhar, Udharam, Haridas and Veerdas, went to her parent's place (pihar) at Khedinagar ([[Kheda district|Kheda]], Gujarat) for their education and proficiency in art of warfare. Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | caption_align = center\n | total_width = 1000\n\n | image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n | alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance\n | link1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n | caption1 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance)'''\n\n | image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n | alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies\n | link2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n | caption2  = '''Central dome with Vidhya Devies'''\n \n | image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n | alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara\n | link3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n | caption3  = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara'''\n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi).

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n[[File:Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg|left|thumb|Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya.[[File:Raja Shri Karan in battle at Chittor by Lalit C Sharma.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Raja Shree Karan in battle alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allaud-din-Khilji (1303) at Chittorgarh.

Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n<br/>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983). Bachhawat Gotriya Mehta Vansh: Utpati, Ateet and Vartmaan (Hindi). Mahendra Prakashan, Udaipur.</ref> This was one of the trade routes to sea ports of Gujarat.\n\nLater, [[Chittorgarh fort|Chittorgarh Fort]] was recovered from Muslim occupation by Maharana Hamir Singh I. Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44-50</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104-7</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122-32, 143-4</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44-50</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104-7</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122-32, 143-4</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.
