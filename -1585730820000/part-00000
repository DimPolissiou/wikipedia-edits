It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment.

Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect.

The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.

The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.

Kier was listed as a public company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1963 until it was acquired by [[Beazer]] in 1986. After a period under the ownership of [[Hanson plc]], it was bought out by its management in 1992, expanded its housing interests, and was relisted on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the early 21st century, it expanded through acquisitions, and in September 2018 Kier was ranked, by turnover, as the second biggest UK construction contractor, behind [[Balfour Beatty]].<ref name=\"Menary-22Sep2018\">{{cite news |last1=Menary |first1=Steve |title=TCI Top 100 Construction Companies 2018 |url=https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/tci-top-100-construction-companies-2018 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Construction Index |date=22 September 2018}}</ref> It was a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]] until its share price plunged following a failed [[rights issue]] in late 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/24/kier-rights-issue-fails-to-attract-investors/|title=Kier rights issue fails to attract investors|date=24 December 2018|publisher=Investors Chronicle|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> after which it started a restructuring, cost-cutting and disposals programme.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe company was founded by Jorgen Lotz and [[Olaf Kier]], [[Denmark|Danish]] engineers, under the name '''Lotz & Kier''' in 1928, and it was based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ACoL299r2EC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Jorgen+Lotz+and+Olaf+Kier&source=bl&ots=aqZCZjIMae&sig=WyeIWRhMlQTXz04mxu70VqZob8A&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Ove Arup, Masterbuilder of the 20th Century by Peter Jones, Page 54|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nA few years later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier retained a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, '''J.L.

Kier and Co|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-World War II===\nBy the late 1930s Kier had moved its head office to [[Belgravia]] in [[Westminster]], and thereby became neighbours to many of Britain's leading construction engineering consultants and contractors, who had formed a substantial coterie in Westminster for professionals and businessmen engaged in civil engineering. Immediate neighbours included Marples Ridgeway (builders of [[Hammersmith Flyover]]) and [[Edmund Nuttall]] (builders of both [[Mersey Tunnels|Mersey road tunnels]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014743/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/views/obituaries/2007/08/09/sir-nicholas-nuttall-64375-19597612/|title=Obituary: Sir Nicholas Nuttall|date=9 August 2007|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Concrete engineering====\nDuring its first 35 years, Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain silos and cement silos, using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and cement silos at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.<ref>pps 28 & 29, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nSuch specialist work was part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300&nbsp;ft high),<ref>pps 17-19, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400&nbsp;ft high),<ref>p 16, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> complete power station structures,<ref>pps 11-14, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> and coastal works such as tanker berths, docks and harbours.<ref>pps 3-7, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n[[Image:Highpoint detail.jpg|right|thumb|Corner detail of [[Highpoint I]], showing balcony profiles.]]\nIn the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings.  Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey ''avant-garde'' development of apartment blocks named [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]], located in [[Highgate|Highgate Village]], north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.<ref>pps 44 & 45, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nWhen this project was completed in 1935 it became widely renowned as the finest example of this form of construction for residential purposes.

However, his son by his first marriage was killed in a riding accident in 1945. Then, during the 1950s, Olaf's nephew, Mogens Kier, joined the firm's management structure, but did not progress to a leading position in the company. Olaf died in an accident in 1986, aged 87; and Mogens died in 2003.<ref>[http://www.kier.co.uk/uploaded/fellowlinks/KierLink%20Newsletter%20Issue%207.pdf Kierlink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142519/http://www.kier.co.uk/uploaded/fellowlinks/KierLink%20Newsletter%20Issue%207.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nJ.L. Kier & Co Ltd remained a private company until 1963 when it obtained a listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became a public company.  Its offer for shares was many times oversubscribed. The Kier family retained a significant majority of the holding. In 1973 Kier merged with [[W. & C. French]] to form '''French Kier''' but within the French division there were heavy losses on fixed-price motorway contracts and land development.  A long-serving Kier engineer, John Mott, was appointed chief executive in order to revive the group's fortunes. Following an abortive bid for Abbey in 1985, French Kier itself was the subject of a hotly contested bid by [[Beazer]], which eventually succeeded in January 1986.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">Wellings, Fred: ''Dictionary of British Housebuilders'' (2006) Troubador. {{ISBN|978-0-9552965-0-5}}</ref>\n\nFive years later (1991) [[Hanson plc]] bought Beazer plc<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71E3DF934A2575AC0A967958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Hanson to Buy Beazer In $609 Million Deal |author=Jonathan P.

Kier was listed as a public company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1963 until it was acquired by [[Beazer]] in 1986. After a period under the ownership of [[Hanson plc]], it was bought out by its management in 1992, expanded its housing interests, and was relisted on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the early 21st century, it expanded through acquisitions, and in September 2018 Kier was ranked, by turnover, as the second biggest UK construction contractor, behind [[Balfour Beatty]].<ref name=\"Menary-22Sep2018\">{{cite news |last1=Menary |first1=Steve |title=TCI Top 100 Construction Companies 2018 |url=https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/tci-top-100-construction-companies-2018 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Construction Index |date=22 September 2018}}</ref> It was a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]] until its share price plunged following a failed [[rights issue]] in late 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/24/kier-rights-issue-fails-to-attract-investors/|title=Kier rights issue fails to attract investors|date=24 December 2018|publisher=Investors Chronicle|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> after which it started a restructuring, cost-cutting and disposals programme.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe company was founded by Jorgen Lotz and [[Olaf Kier]], [[Denmark|Danish]] engineers, under the name '''Lotz & Kier''' in 1928, and it was based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ACoL299r2EC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Jorgen+Lotz+and+Olaf+Kier&source=bl&ots=aqZCZjIMae&sig=WyeIWRhMlQTXz04mxu70VqZob8A&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Ove Arup, Masterbuilder of the 20th Century by Peter Jones, Page 54|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nA few years later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier retained a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, '''J.L.

Immediate neighbours included Marples Ridgeway (builders of [[Hammersmith Flyover]]) and [[Edmund Nuttall]] (builders of both [[Mersey Tunnels|Mersey road tunnels]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014743/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/views/obituaries/2007/08/09/sir-nicholas-nuttall-64375-19597612/|title=Obituary: Sir Nicholas Nuttall|date=9 August 2007|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Concrete engineering====\nDuring its first 35 years, Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain silos and cement silos, using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and cement silos at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.<ref>pps 28 & 29, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nSuch specialist work was part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300&nbsp;ft high),<ref>pps 17-19, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400&nbsp;ft high),<ref>p 16, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> complete power station structures,<ref>pps 11-14, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> and coastal works such as tanker berths, docks and harbours.<ref>pps 3-7, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n[[Image:Highpoint detail.jpg|right|thumb|Corner detail of [[Highpoint I]], showing balcony profiles.]]\nIn the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings.  Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey ''avant-garde'' development of apartment blocks named [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]], located in [[Highgate|Highgate Village]], north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.<ref>pps 44 & 45, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nWhen this project was completed in 1935 it became widely renowned as the finest example of this form of construction for residential purposes.

However, his son by his first marriage was killed in a riding accident in 1945. Then, during the 1950s, Olaf's nephew, Mogens Kier, joined the firm's management structure, but did not progress to a leading position in the company.

Kier & Co Ltd remained a private company until 1963 when it obtained a listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became a public company.  Its offer for shares was many times oversubscribed. The Kier family retained a significant majority of the holding. In 1973 Kier merged with [[W. & C. French]] to form '''French Kier''' but within the French division there were heavy losses on fixed-price motorway contracts and land development.  A long-serving Kier engineer, John Mott, was appointed chief executive in order to revive the group's fortunes. Following an abortive bid for Abbey in 1985, French Kier itself was the subject of a hotly contested bid by [[Beazer]], which eventually succeeded in January 1986.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">Wellings, Fred: ''Dictionary of British Housebuilders'' (2006) Troubador. {{ISBN|978-0-9552965-0-5}}</ref>\n\nFive years later (1991) [[Hanson plc]] bought Beazer plc<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71E3DF934A2575AC0A967958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Hanson to Buy Beazer In $609 Million Deal |author=Jonathan P.
