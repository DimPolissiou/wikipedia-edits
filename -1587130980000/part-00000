Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity''). Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen.

This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity'').

Dowell was selected and was intending to be a balance beam and uneven bars specialist. However, Dowell did not compete. Dowell was demoted to team alternate after teammate and 2012 Olympic Gold medalist, [[McKayla Maroney]] was selected to compete as an All-Around competitor. According to FIG rules, each country may only have 3 competitors on each apparatus. Following the World Championships, Dowell declined invitations to attend the Mexican Open in [[Acapulco, Mexico]] and two other World Cup events.\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\nIn February 2014, Dowell was selected as a last minute replacement for World Champion [[Simone Biles]] to compete in the 2014 [[American Cup (gymnastics)|American Cup]].

On bars, she included her Tweddle release in combination with a half turn transfer (Ezhova). She fell on her toe-on Shaposhnikova (Maloney) and dismounted with a full-twisting double layout. Despite the fall, she scored a 14.350 and finished 8th on the event. A mistake and fall on beam scored an 11.800 and she finished 18th on the event.\n\n'''P&G Championships'''\n\nOn August 13 & 15, Dowell competed at the P&G Championships where she competed in the all-around for the first time since 2013. She finished in 11th with a 2-night score of 113.700, including a 15.150 on uneven bars. She was named to the Senior National Team and was invited to the 2015 Worlds Selection Camp in September.\n\n'''World Championships'''\n\nOn October 8, Dowell, alongside Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, Maggie Nichols, Aly Raisman, and Mykayla Skinner, was once again chosen to represent the United States of America at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, in Glasgow. She competed floor, vault, and bars in team qualification. During her floor performance in qualifications her music did not play. She still competed a solid routine without music, and went along with the clapping from the audience. On floor, she performed a piked double front salto. This was the first time the skill had been performed at the World Championships, and thus it was named after her in the Code of Points. She performed a solid vault afterward.  She also competed on the uneven bars.  Dowell later became a world champion, winning gold with the team.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\nIn early 2016, Brenna attended the U.S Olympic Team Summit, an event for potential U.S Olympic Team members to meet with the media and do promotional work. She attended with fellow 2015 World Championships gold medalists, [[Simone Biles]], [[Aly Raisman]]. [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Madison Kocian]], [[Maggie Nichols (gymnast)|Maggie Nichols]] and [[MyKayla Skinner]].\n\nIn April, Dowell was chosen to compete at the [[2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships]] in Everett, Washington. On day 1 of competition, Brenna had a clean competition, hitting all 4 of her events which helped team USA take the gold medal. She also took 4th place All-Around with a score of 58.850, making a strong case to earn one of the 5 spots on the 2016 U.S Olympic Team, coming back strong after having a bad experience at the 2015 World Championships, where she struggled with nerves despite earning a gold medal with team USA. Dowell, whilst having the 4th highest score at the Pacific Rim Championships, did not officially earn the 4th place spot due to the two per country rule. Officially, Shallon Olsen of Canada earned that spot, however it will be noted by the selection committee for the 2016 U.S Olympic team that she did indeed earn the fourth highest score behind U.S teammates, [[Aly Raisman]], [[Simone Biles]] and [[Laurie Hernandez]].\n\nDowell also qualified in second place to the Uneven Bars final, after displaying an impressive set on night 1 of competition. Also, after [[Simone Biles]], was withdrawn from event finals, Dowell also earned a spot in the Floor Exercise final. In event finals, unfortunately, Dowell fell on a release move in the Uneven Bars final, incurring a deduction and placing her 5th with a score of 14.000.

She competed floor, vault, and bars in team qualification. During her floor performance in qualifications her music did not play. She still competed a solid routine without music, and went along with the clapping from the audience. On floor, she performed a piked double front salto. This was the first time the skill had been performed at the World Championships, and thus it was named after her in the Code of Points. She performed a solid vault afterward.  She also competed on the uneven bars.  Dowell later became a world champion, winning gold with the team.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\nIn early 2016, Brenna attended the U.S Olympic Team Summit, an event for potential U.S Olympic Team members to meet with the media and do promotional work. She attended with fellow 2015 World Championships gold medalists, [[Simone Biles]], [[Aly Raisman]]. [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Madison Kocian]], [[Maggie Nichols (gymnast)|Maggie Nichols]] and [[MyKayla Skinner]].\n\nIn April, Dowell was chosen to compete at the [[2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships]] in Everett, Washington. On day 1 of competition, Brenna had a clean competition, hitting all 4 of her events which helped team USA take the gold medal. She also took 4th place All-Around with a score of 58.850, making a strong case to earn one of the 5 spots on the 2016 U.S Olympic Team, coming back strong after having a bad experience at the 2015 World Championships, where she struggled with nerves despite earning a gold medal with team USA. Dowell, whilst having the 4th highest score at the Pacific Rim Championships, did not officially earn the 4th place spot due to the two per country rule. Officially, Shallon Olsen of Canada earned that spot, however it will be noted by the selection committee for the 2016 U.S Olympic team that she did indeed earn the fourth highest score behind U.S teammates, [[Aly Raisman]], [[Simone Biles]] and [[Laurie Hernandez]].\n\nDowell also qualified in second place to the Uneven Bars final, after displaying an impressive set on night 1 of competition. Also, after [[Simone Biles]], was withdrawn from event finals, Dowell also earned a spot in the Floor Exercise final. In event finals, unfortunately, Dowell fell on a release move in the Uneven Bars final, incurring a deduction and placing her 5th with a score of 14.000. However, she came back strong and earned a silver medal in Floor Exercise finals with a score of 14.825 behind reigning Olympic Floor Exercise champion and U.S teammate, [[Aly Raisman]].\n\nAt the 2016 P&G championships, Dowell was named to the National Team and earned a berth to the 2016 Olympic Trials in San Jose, CA. Despite solid efforts, she didn't make the main or alternate teams\n\n=== '''2017''' ===\nIn 2017, Dowell continued her gymnastics career at the University of Oklahoma for her Sophomore season. \n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{USAG|143542|Brenna Dowell}}\n* {{FIG|bio=33809|lic=17849|name=Brenna Dowell}}\n\n{{NavigationWorldChampionsArtisticGymnasticsWomenTC|2015}}\n{{PanAmChampionsWAGTeam|2010}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Vault Champions (Women)}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Floor Exercise Champions (Women)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dowell, Brenna}}\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American female artistic gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Kansas City, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]]\n[[Category:Originators of elements in artistic gymnastics]]\n[[Category:U.S. women's national team gymnasts]]\n", "name_user": "LouisD1212", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenna_Dowell"}
