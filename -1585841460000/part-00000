The four ships of this class would have been larger, faster and more heavily armed than any existing battleship (although several projected foreign ships would be larger). The G3s have been considered to be proper \"[[fast battleship]]s\" since they were well-balanced designs with adequate protection. Nonetheless the class was officially designated as a \"battlecruiser\" due to their higher speed and lesser firepower and armour relative to the planned [[N3 class battleship]] design. The G3s carried nine {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns and were expected to achieve {{convert|32|knots|lk=in}}, while the N3s would carry nine {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns on the same displacement at the expense of a slower speed.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe G3 design was approved by the [[Board of Admiralty]] on 12 August 1921. Orders were placed in October, but were suspended in mid-November shortly after the beginning of the [[Washington Naval Conference]] which limited battleship sizes. The orders were cancelled in February 1922 with the ratification of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] which limited construction to ships of no more than {{convert|35000|LT|t}} displacement.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1916 the US had declared its intention to create a Navy \"second to none\"; the United States Congress had authorized the building of a large number of battleships and battlecruisers. In the aftermath of the First World War, the Japanese government were also embarking on a large programme of warship building. Meanwhile, in Great Britain, the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s were followed by the slower and cheaper {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}}. Two improved ''Revenge''-class hulls were converted during construction into the two {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|1}}s as emergency builds during the war. The only new capital ships laid down in the war were the {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|2}}s. Their design had been called into question after the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. Three of this class were cancelled, leaving only {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} to be completed to an altered design.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe US plan had been delayed by the wartime need to build smaller vessels. Nevertheless, estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the UK would be behind in ships. The British did have access to German technology through ships such as the battleship {{SMS|Baden||2}} which had been saved from the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling of the interned German]] [[High Seas Fleet]] in [[Scapa Flow]] and the experiences of the war. A committee concluded that any new ship should be able to match the speed of the new US {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s, expected to make 32 knots. Consequently, a series of designs was prepared of ships with displacements ranging from {{convert|53100|to|44500|LT|t}}, the only limitations being the ability to use British dockyards and passage through the [[Suez Canal]]. These designs were given letters of the alphabet running backwards from K to G. The related battleship designs under consideration at the same time had design letters from L upwards.<ref>Campbell, Part 2, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe first two design proposals, 'K2' and 'K3', had a general layout similar to ''Hood'', but were armed with either eight or nine 18-inch guns, in four twin or three triple [[gun turret]]s, respectively. The numeral in the designation came from the number of guns in each turret. These ships were very large, displacing {{convert|52000|to|53100|LT|t}}, could only reach {{convert|30|kn}}, and could only be docked in a single ex-German [[floating dry dock|floating dock]] and one dock, [[Gladstone Dock]], in [[Liverpool]]. '[[J3 Class battlecruiser|J3]]', the next proposal, saved nearly {{convert|10000|LT|t}} by reducing the main armament to nine 50-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns and the main deck armour to {{convert|4|in|0}}. This reduction in size allowed the ship to dock anywhere that ''Hood'' could dock and to pass through the Suez and [[Panama Canal]]s. 'I3' took another route in saving weight and concentrated the main armament amidships with 'X' turret placed between the forward superstructure and the funnels. The consequent weight savings were negated by additional hull and machinery weights and the ship displaced only slightly less than 'K3'. It had the advantage, however, that it could be docked in [[Rosyth]] and [[Portsmouth]] and pass through both canals, once the Suez Canal had been deepened. The primary drawback was that the main armament had a blind spot towards the rear of the ship of no less than 40\u00b0. Several variations were evaluated of the 'H3' design with the number of turrets reduced. In 'H3a' both turrets were forward of the superstructure while in 'H3b' one was forward and the other was aft of the forward superstructure. 'H3c' retained the layout of 'H3b', but lowered the turrets by one deck and saved {{convert|1250|LT|t}} over the {{convert|45000|LT|t}} of 'H3b'. All three 'H3' designs had a maximum speed of {{convert|33|kn}}, but the reduced number of main guns was disliked so the 'G3' was proposed with the three triple turrets, armed with {{convert|16.5|in|0|adj=on}} guns to save weight.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\nThis design was accepted at the end of 1920, but changes were made as the design was finalized in early 1921, including the reduction of the ship's horsepower from 180,000 to 160,000 and the reduction of the main armament from 16.5&nbsp;inches to {{convert|16|in|0}}.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 95</ref>\n\n==Design and description==\nThe G3s incorporated several novel features for [[dreadnought]]-era capital ships, or at least for British designs of this type. Most immediately noticeable was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and engineering spaces, giving the ships a [[Petroleum tanker|tanker]]-like appearance. Since the G3s were to use existing dockyard facilities, this layout allowed designers to keep the length of the ships, as well as the weight of armour, to a minimum. The resulting loss of heavy fire astern was considered justifiable since the ships were intended to fight on the broadside.<ref>This arrangement of the main armament was later used in the [[French Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}}- and {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}s. As both French designs had only two turrets these were given as wide a separation as allowed by the other design constraints.</ref> A related feature of the G3 and N3 designs was their tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets.

They were arranged in three engine rooms. The forward engine room held the two turbines for the wing shafts, the middle compartment housed the turbine for the port inner shaft and the aft engine room contained the turbine for the starboard inner shaft. The turbines were powered by 20 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler|small-tube boilers]] divided between nine boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of {{convert|160000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|200|psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and temperature of {{convert|392|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with [[superheater|superheat]].

The primary DCT was mounted at the top of the forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the [[conning tower]] in an armoured hood and the third was aft.<ref name=\"rr68\"/> Each main gun turret was provided with a {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on|1}} [[coincidence rangefinder]] in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by three DCTs. Two mounted on each side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and the third was aft. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the very top of the forward superstructure. Each ''pom-pom'' mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on|1}} torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels.<ref name=\"c442\"/>\n\n===Armour===\nA first for any British [[dreadnought]] was the use of the [[All or Nothing (Battleship armour)|all or nothing]] protection scheme in the G3s. Medium-thickness armour had proven to be useless in stopping heavy-calibre shells during World War I so the vital areas of the ship were protected by the thickest possible armour and the rest of the ship was left unarmoured. Use of this system was pioneered by contemporary [[U.S. Navy]] battleship designs starting with the {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. However, this system of protection required that the [[armoured citadel]] should have enough [[reserve buoyancy]] to keep the ship stable even if the rest of the hull was riddled by gunfire.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of the G3 had a maximum thickness of {{convert|14|in|0}} with the top of the armour angled 18\u00b0 outwards. This angle increased the armor's relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire, albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. It ran some {{convert|522|ft|1}}, from the forward edge of 'A' barbette to the rear of the after 6-inch magazine. The belt had a height of {{convert|14|ft|3|in|m|1}}, of which {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. Only the forward {{convert|259|ft|1}} of the belt had the maximum thickness, it thinned to {{convert|12|in|0}} for the rest of its length. The lower edge of the belt abreast the magazines was continued down another {{convert|3|ft|1}} by a {{convert|4|in}} thickness of high-tensile steel inclined at 36\u00b0 to prevent a shell from reaching the magazines via a wave trough at high speed. The forward and rear ends of the belt terminated in 12-inch and {{convert|10|in|0|adj=on}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] respectively. The waterline belt extended forward {{convert|46|ft|1}} at a thickness of 6&nbsp;inches that reduced to {{convert|2.25|in}} in two steps.<ref>Campbell, Part 3, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nThe funnel and boiler room ventilation shafts were surrounded by an armoured box {{convert|116|ft|1}} long intended to prevent shells fired from behind the ship reaching 'X' magazine. The box narrowed at an angle of 21\u00b0 as it rose and had a maximum thickness of 12&nbsp;inches nearest to the magazine. Aft it reduced in a series of steps to {{convert|9|in|0}}, 6&nbsp;inches, {{convert|5|in|0}} and {{convert|4|in|0}}. The armoured deck matched the length of the waterline belt and sloped down 2.5\u00b0 to meet the upper edge of the belt. It had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}} from the 'A' barbette to partway over the mid-boiler rooms and thinned to a minimum of 4&nbsp;inches over the rear engine and boiler rooms. The deck's thickness increased to  {{convert|7|in}} partway over the rear engine room and covered the aft 6-inch magazines. The armoured deck extended forward 46&nbsp;feet over the torpedo compartment with a maximum thickness of 8&nbsp;inches, thinning to 6&nbsp;inches. The armoured deck's rear extension was {{convert|106|ft|9|in|1}} long and was 5&nbsp;inches thick until the last {{convert|27|ft|4|in|1}} when it thinned to {{convert|3|in|0}}.<ref>Campbell, Part 3, pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nThe turret faces were {{convert|17.5|in|0}} thick while their sides ranged from {{convert|9|to|13|in|0}} in thickness, and the roof was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The armour of the barbettes ranged from {{convert|11|to|14|in|0}} in thickness and it was carefully arranged to minimize the likely risk. The [[conning tower]] armour was 9 to 12&nbsp;inches thick and its communications tube to the upper deck was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The fire-control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood 3 to 5&nbsp;inches thick.<ref name=c43>Campbell, Part 3, p. 43</ref>\n\nThe [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s of the G3 battlecruisers were intended to withstand the explosion of a {{convert|750|lb|adj=on}} torpedo [[warhead]]. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the [[torpedo bulkhead]] that consisted of two layers of {{convert|.875|in|adj=on|0}} high-tensile steel. The bulkhead was situated some {{convert|13.5|ft|1}} inboard from the side of the ship.<ref name=c43/> Postwar tests done on a replica of this system showed that filling the buoyancy space with water rather than the sealed steel crushing tubes as used in {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} was just as effective and weighed less.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 93</ref> A compressed air system was fitted to blow the water out of the buoyancy spaces and bring the ship upright in 15 minutes after two torpedo hits.<ref name=rr1/> The ship's [[double bottom]] ranged from {{convert|5|-|7|ft|1}} in depth.<ref name=c43/>\n\n==Orders and cancellation==\nAt the end of the tendering process, the four G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from [[John Brown & Company|John Brown]], [[Swan Hunter]], [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] and [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]]. Following the visit of an Admiralty delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors.<ref>Johnston, p. 178</ref> Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.<ref name=\"Johnston, p. 179\">Johnston, p. 179</ref>\n\nThe [[Washington Naval Treaty]], an [[Arms control|arms limitation]] treaty which began negotiation on 11 November 1921, led to the suspension of building on 18 November and outright cancellation on 21 February 1922 because the treaty forbade construction of any ship larger than {{convert|35000|LT|t}}. As no photographic evidence is available to show the ships' keels were actually [[laid down]], it is asserted by at least one historian that none were,<ref>Campbell, Part 3, p. 44</ref> although the Admiralty paid John Brown for work and materials which would have been incurred in doing so.<ref name=\"Johnston, p. 179\"/>\n\nMany of the aspects of their design ultimately were incorporated into the two {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}, and they are often described as being a cut-down G3. Indeed, the ''Nelsons'' received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence from the 'N3' battleship design although they used the guns intended for the G3 class for cost reasons and to comply with the Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament.<ref>Burt, p. 328</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Battleships}}\n* {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}} - a contemporary U.S. design also cancelled as a result of the Washington Treaty\n* {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|1}} - a series of four battlecruisers planned for the Imperial Japanese Navy as part of the so-called Eight-eight fleet, cancelled as a result of the Washington Treaty\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David K.|title=The Grand Fleet: Warship Design and Development 1906\u20131922|publisher=Caxton Editions|location=London|year=2003|edition=reprint of the 1999|isbn=1-84067-531-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

The four ships of this class would have been larger, faster and more heavily armed than any existing battleship (although several projected foreign ships would be larger). The G3s have been considered to be proper \"[[fast battleship]]s\" since they were well-balanced designs with adequate protection. Nonetheless the class was officially designated as a \"battlecruiser\" due to their higher speed and lesser firepower and armour relative to the planned [[N3 class battleship]] design. The G3s carried nine {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns and were expected to achieve {{convert|32|knots|lk=in}}, while the N3s would carry nine {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns on the same displacement at the expense of a slower speed.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe G3 design was approved by the [[Board of Admiralty]] on 12 August 1921. Orders were placed in October, but were suspended in mid-November shortly after the beginning of the [[Washington Naval Conference]] which limited battleship sizes. The orders were cancelled in February 1922 with the ratification of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] which limited construction to ships of no more than {{convert|35000|LT|t}} displacement.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1916 the US had declared its intention to create a Navy \"second to none\"; the United States Congress had authorized the building of a large number of battleships and battlecruisers. In the aftermath of the First World War, the Japanese government were also embarking on a large programme of warship building. Meanwhile, in Great Britain, the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s were followed by the slower and cheaper {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}}. Two improved ''Revenge''-class hulls were converted during construction into the two {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|1}}s as emergency builds during the war. The only new capital ships laid down in the war were the {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|2}}s. Their design had been called into question after the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. Three of this class were cancelled, leaving only {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} to be completed to an altered design.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe US plan had been delayed by the wartime need to build smaller vessels. Nevertheless, estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the UK would be behind in ships. The British did have access to German technology through ships such as the battleship {{SMS|Baden||2}} which had been saved from the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling of the interned German]] [[High Seas Fleet]] in [[Scapa Flow]] and the experiences of the war. A committee concluded that any new ship should be able to match the speed of the new US {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s, expected to make 32 knots. Consequently, a series of designs was prepared of ships with displacements ranging from {{convert|53100|to|44500|LT|t}}, the only limitations being the ability to use British dockyards and passage through the [[Suez Canal]]. These designs were given letters of the alphabet running backwards from K to G. The related battleship designs under consideration at the same time had design letters from L upwards.<ref>Campbell, Part 2, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe first two design proposals, 'K2' and 'K3', had a general layout similar to ''Hood'', but were armed with either eight or nine 18-inch guns, in four twin or three triple [[gun turret]]s, respectively. The numeral in the designation came from the number of guns in each turret. These ships were very large, displacing {{convert|52000|to|53100|LT|t}}, could only reach {{convert|30|kn}}, and could only be docked in a single ex-German [[floating dry dock|floating dock]] and one dock, [[Gladstone Dock]], in [[Liverpool]]. '[[J3 Class battlecruiser|J3]]', the next proposal, saved nearly {{convert|10000|LT|t}} by reducing the main armament to nine 50-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns and the main deck armour to {{convert|4|in|0}}. This reduction in size allowed the ship to dock anywhere that ''Hood'' could dock and to pass through the Suez and [[Panama Canal]]s. 'I3' took another route in saving weight and concentrated the main armament amidships with 'X' turret placed between the forward superstructure and the funnels. The consequent weight savings were negated by additional hull and machinery weights and the ship displaced only slightly less than 'K3'. It had the advantage, however, that it could be docked in [[Rosyth]] and [[Portsmouth]] and pass through both canals, once the Suez Canal had been deepened. The primary drawback was that the main armament had a blind spot towards the rear of the ship of no less than 40\u00b0. Several variations were evaluated of the 'H3' design with the number of turrets reduced. In 'H3a' both turrets were forward of the superstructure while in 'H3b' one was forward and the other was aft of the forward superstructure. 'H3c' retained the layout of 'H3b', but lowered the turrets by one deck and saved {{convert|1250|LT|t}} over the {{convert|45000|LT|t}} of 'H3b'. All three 'H3' designs had a maximum speed of {{convert|33|kn}}, but the reduced number of main guns was disliked so the 'G3' was proposed with the three triple turrets, armed with {{convert|16.5|in|0|adj=on}} guns to save weight.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\nThis design was accepted at the end of 1920, but changes were made as the design was finalized in early 1921, including the reduction of the ship's horsepower from 180,000 to 160,000 and the reduction of the main armament from 16.5&nbsp;inches to {{convert|16|in|0}}.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 95</ref>\n\n==Design and description==\nThe G3s incorporated several novel features for [[dreadnought]]-era capital ships, or at least for British designs of this type. Most immediately noticeable was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and engineering spaces, giving the ships a [[Petroleum tanker|tanker]]-like appearance. Since the G3s were to use existing dockyard facilities, this layout allowed designers to keep the length of the ships, as well as the weight of armour, to a minimum. The resulting loss of heavy fire astern was considered justifiable since the ships were intended to fight on the broadside.<ref>This arrangement of the main armament was later used in the [[French Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}}- and {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}s. As both French designs had only two turrets these were given as wide a separation as allowed by the other design constraints.</ref> A related feature of the G3 and N3 designs was their tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 127</ref>\n\n===General characteristics===\nThe G3 battlecruisers were significantly larger than their predecessors of the Admiral class. They had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|856|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|106|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|36|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. They would have displaced {{convert|48400|LT|MT}} normally and {{convert|53909|LT|MT}} at deep load, over {{convert|8000|LT|MT}} more than the older ships. They had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|7.786|ft|1}} at deep load as well as a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=rr1>Raven and Roberts, p. 101</ref>\n\n===Propulsion===\nThe G3 battlecruisers would have had four geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each of which drove one propeller shaft. They were arranged in three engine rooms. The forward engine room held the two turbines for the wing shafts, the middle compartment housed the turbine for the port inner shaft and the aft engine room contained the turbine for the starboard inner shaft. The turbines were powered by 20 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler|small-tube boilers]] divided between nine boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of {{convert|160000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|200|psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and temperature of {{convert|392|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with [[superheater|superheat]]. Maximum speed would have been {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=c44>Campbell, pt. 4, p. 44</ref>\n\nThe ships had a maximum capacity of {{convert|5000|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]]. Using the {{convert|22000|shp|adj=on}} cruising turbines, they had an estimated maximum range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}. They had six turbo-driven {{convert|250|kW|0|adj=on}} [[dynamo]]s and two {{convert|300|kW|0|adj=on}} [[Diesel generator]]s.<ref name=c44/>\n\n===Armament===\nHousing the main armament in triple turrets was new to the Royal Navy though British companies had been involved in the production of triple gun turret designs for other navies.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 9</ref> The choice of a high muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15-inch Mark I]] gun of 42-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 7</ref>\n\nThe G3 design mounted nine [[BL 16 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 16-inch Mark I]] 45-calibre guns in three triple hydraulically powered Mark I [[gun turret]]s, designated 'A', 'B', and 'X' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to \u22123\u00b0 and elevated to 40\u00b0. The ships' maximum stowage was 116 shells per gun.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 98, 100</ref> They fired {{convert|2048|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2670|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.

Their compartment was located just forward of the 'A' shell room on the platform deck.<ref name=\"rr68\"/> Six {{convert|24.5|in|adj=on}} torpedoes per tube were to be carried in peacetime, but this would increase to eight in wartime.<ref name=\"c442\"/> These Mark I torpedoes had a warhead of {{convert|743|lb|0}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and were powered by oxygen-enriched air. They had two speed settings which governed their range: either {{convert|15000|yd|0}} at {{convert|35|kn}}, or {{convert|20000|yd|0}} at {{convert|30|kn}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PreWWII.htm|title=British Torpedoes Pre-World War II: 24.5\" (62.2 cm) Mark I|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=7 March 2010|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref>\n\n===Fire-control===\nThe main guns of the G3 battlecruisers could be controlled from any of the three [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control towers]] (DCT). The primary DCT was mounted at the top of the forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the [[conning tower]] in an armoured hood and the third was aft.<ref name=\"rr68\"/> Each main gun turret was provided with a {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on|1}} [[coincidence rangefinder]] in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by three DCTs. Two mounted on each side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and the third was aft. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the very top of the forward superstructure. Each ''pom-pom'' mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on|1}} torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels.<ref name=\"c442\"/>\n\n===Armour===\nA first for any British [[dreadnought]] was the use of the [[All or Nothing (Battleship armour)|all or nothing]] protection scheme in the G3s. Medium-thickness armour had proven to be useless in stopping heavy-calibre shells during World War I so the vital areas of the ship were protected by the thickest possible armour and the rest of the ship was left unarmoured. Use of this system was pioneered by contemporary [[U.S. Navy]] battleship designs starting with the {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. However, this system of protection required that the [[armoured citadel]] should have enough [[reserve buoyancy]] to keep the ship stable even if the rest of the hull was riddled by gunfire.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of the G3 had a maximum thickness of {{convert|14|in|0}} with the top of the armour angled 18\u00b0 outwards. This angle increased the armor's relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire, albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. It ran some {{convert|522|ft|1}}, from the forward edge of 'A' barbette to the rear of the after 6-inch magazine. The belt had a height of {{convert|14|ft|3|in|m|1}}, of which {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. Only the forward {{convert|259|ft|1}} of the belt had the maximum thickness, it thinned to {{convert|12|in|0}} for the rest of its length. The lower edge of the belt abreast the magazines was continued down another {{convert|3|ft|1}} by a {{convert|4|in}} thickness of high-tensile steel inclined at 36\u00b0 to prevent a shell from reaching the magazines via a wave trough at high speed. The forward and rear ends of the belt terminated in 12-inch and {{convert|10|in|0|adj=on}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] respectively. The waterline belt extended forward {{convert|46|ft|1}} at a thickness of 6&nbsp;inches that reduced to {{convert|2.25|in}} in two steps.<ref>Campbell, Part 3, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nThe funnel and boiler room ventilation shafts were surrounded by an armoured box {{convert|116|ft|1}} long intended to prevent shells fired from behind the ship reaching 'X' magazine. The box narrowed at an angle of 21\u00b0 as it rose and had a maximum thickness of 12&nbsp;inches nearest to the magazine. Aft it reduced in a series of steps to {{convert|9|in|0}}, 6&nbsp;inches, {{convert|5|in|0}} and {{convert|4|in|0}}. The armoured deck matched the length of the waterline belt and sloped down 2.5\u00b0 to meet the upper edge of the belt. It had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}} from the 'A' barbette to partway over the mid-boiler rooms and thinned to a minimum of 4&nbsp;inches over the rear engine and boiler rooms. The deck's thickness increased to  {{convert|7|in}} partway over the rear engine room and covered the aft 6-inch magazines. The armoured deck extended forward 46&nbsp;feet over the torpedo compartment with a maximum thickness of 8&nbsp;inches, thinning to 6&nbsp;inches. The armoured deck's rear extension was {{convert|106|ft|9|in|1}} long and was 5&nbsp;inches thick until the last {{convert|27|ft|4|in|1}} when it thinned to {{convert|3|in|0}}.<ref>Campbell, Part 3, pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nThe turret faces were {{convert|17.5|in|0}} thick while their sides ranged from {{convert|9|to|13|in|0}} in thickness, and the roof was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The armour of the barbettes ranged from {{convert|11|to|14|in|0}} in thickness and it was carefully arranged to minimize the likely risk. The [[conning tower]] armour was 9 to 12&nbsp;inches thick and its communications tube to the upper deck was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The fire-control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood 3 to 5&nbsp;inches thick.<ref name=c43>Campbell, Part 3, p. 43</ref>\n\nThe [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s of the G3 battlecruisers were intended to withstand the explosion of a {{convert|750|lb|adj=on}} torpedo [[warhead]]. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the [[torpedo bulkhead]] that consisted of two layers of {{convert|.875|in|adj=on|0}} high-tensile steel. The bulkhead was situated some {{convert|13.5|ft|1}} inboard from the side of the ship.<ref name=c43/> Postwar tests done on a replica of this system showed that filling the buoyancy space with water rather than the sealed steel crushing tubes as used in {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} was just as effective and weighed less.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 93</ref> A compressed air system was fitted to blow the water out of the buoyancy spaces and bring the ship upright in 15 minutes after two torpedo hits.<ref name=rr1/> The ship's [[double bottom]] ranged from {{convert|5|-|7|ft|1}} in depth.<ref name=c43/>\n\n==Orders and cancellation==\nAt the end of the tendering process, the four G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from [[John Brown & Company|John Brown]], [[Swan Hunter]], [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] and [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]]. Following the visit of an Admiralty delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors.<ref>Johnston, p. 178</ref> Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.<ref name=\"Johnston, p. 179\">Johnston, p. 179</ref>\n\nThe [[Washington Naval Treaty]], an [[Arms control|arms limitation]] treaty which began negotiation on 11 November 1921, led to the suspension of building on 18 November and outright cancellation on 21 February 1922 because the treaty forbade construction of any ship larger than {{convert|35000|LT|t}}. As no photographic evidence is available to show the ships' keels were actually [[laid down]], it is asserted by at least one historian that none were,<ref>Campbell, Part 3, p. 44</ref> although the Admiralty paid John Brown for work and materials which would have been incurred in doing so.<ref name=\"Johnston, p. 179\"/>\n\nMany of the aspects of their design ultimately were incorporated into the two {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}, and they are often described as being a cut-down G3. Indeed, the ''Nelsons'' received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence from the 'N3' battleship design although they used the guns intended for the G3 class for cost reasons and to comply with the Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament.<ref>Burt, p. 328</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Battleships}}\n* {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}} - a contemporary U.S. design also cancelled as a result of the Washington Treaty\n* {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|1}} - a series of four battlecruisers planned for the Imperial Japanese Navy as part of the so-called Eight-eight fleet, cancelled as a result of the Washington Treaty\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David K.|title=The Grand Fleet: Warship Design and Development 1906\u20131922|publisher=Caxton Editions|location=London|year=2003|edition=reprint of the 1999|isbn=1-84067-531-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.
