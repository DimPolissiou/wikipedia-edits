The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate.

It was introduced in 1994, with a similar bodyshell to the WAP-1 class, but with Hitachi traction motors. Electricals are traditional DC loco type tap changers, driving six [[traction motor]]s arranged in Co-Co fashion. This locomotive has proved to be highly successful, with over 750 units in service. Newer examples have been fitted with microprocessor-controlled diagnostics, static converter units (instead of arnos) and roof-mounted dynamic (rheostatic) brakes. The locomotive can be seen in service across the electrified network of Indian Railways and is homed at 14 sheds (depots).\n\nThe last locomotive produced by the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) was numbered 25051 in December 2015 and production of this locomotive has been stopped.\n\n==Design==\nThe loco has a streamlined twin cab carbody design, with top-mounted headlamps. The first 150 or so units had the headlamp mounted at waist level, with the lights being mounted in a protruding nacelle. Some earlier locos, especially from the Erode loco shed have the headlamps placed on the top. Later on the headlamps were placed in a recessed nacelle, and from road #22579 onward, the headlamps were moved to the top. Also they have digital notch repeaters.\n\nNewer locos also feature larger windshields, more spacious driver cabin with [[bucket seat]]s and ergonomic controls. The control panel also features a mix of digital and analog displays in newer units (all analog display in older versions).\n\nOriginal units were weighed 120 tonnes, which was brought down to 112 tonnes through the usage of lighter material.\n\nSome of the WAP-1 and WAP-3 and all the WAP-6 units were rebuilt to WAP-4 specifications after replacing the bogies & electricals.\n\nIt has different underframe for handling larger buffing loads. Some units are fitted with speed recorders and some changes to control electronics. Some units also have [[data recorder]]s for energy consumption. Some are even fitted with [[windshield washer]]s and [[rearview mirror]]s. Few were provided with signalling lamps which were subsequently removed.\n\nTechnical variants include WAP-4E which are probably fitted with electronic sensors for sensing pipe pressure loss.\n\nThe Hitachi traction motors are the ones used on freight engines. It was a challenge to put these in a passenger engine due to weight constraints. So the transformer is aluminum foil-wound and aluminum chequered plates are used for reducing the weight.\n\n415 volts, three-phase, 50&nbsp;Hz power supply is used to drive various auxiliary motors like (1) Traction motor blowers (2) Transformer radiater blower (3) Transformer oil pump (4) Smoothing Reactor Blowers (5) Silicon Rectifier Blowers (6) Battery charger. The three-phase, 415 volt supply is obtained from the single phase supply by Arno converter or static converter.\n\nIndian railways has installed microprocessor based fault diagnostic system and Vigilance Control Device for the enhancement of safety and reliability of electric Locomotives. Some of the newly manufactured WAP-4 locomotives also have air conditioning system for the loco pilot.\n\n== Performance ==\nIf the average weight of ICF coach is 55 tonnes then it can haul the following capacity in tonnes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">Wolfram387&ndash;388 n58.</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung for example, has proposed that it may mean \"rock people\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the [[Geats|Gauts]] in what is today Sweden.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> \n\nIt has also been noted by some scholars, starting with [[Karl M\u00fcllenhoff]] in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of [[Scandza]], [[Jordanes]] listed \"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\" among those who \"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\".<ref name=chr>Latin and translation given at {{cite book|last=Christensen |first=Arne S\u00f8by|title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002| location=Copenhagen|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |ref=harv|pages=267-268}}</ref> M\u00fcllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the terms.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=296\u2013298}}\n\n==History==\n{{see|Ostrogoths#History}}\n\nThe first event which classical authors clearly describe as involving the Greuthungi was the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366), as described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Noviodunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor [[Gratian]]. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report a last great event in which the Greuthungi went under that name, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn time and geographical area, the Greutungi and their neighbours, the Thervingi, correspond to the archaeological [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52-54.</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nChernyakhov cemeteries include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials in which the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54-56.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Ostrogoths==\nThe Tervingi were first attested by 291, indicating that different Gothic peoples already had distinct identities and names by that time.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\">Wolfram, 24.</ref> The Greuthungi are first named by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], writing no earlier than 392 and perhaps later than 395.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> The earliest events where he describes the Grethungi were in the 360s.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}} The Ostrogoths, are also first mentioned in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greutungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|loc=p.24 & p.387 fn52}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} \n\nDespite such records which seem to show the Ostrogoths and Greutungi as distinct, according to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greutungi or [[Vesi]]/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> When the names were used together, Wolfram argues that it is significant that the pairing was always preserved, as in ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/>\n\nThe nomenclature of Greuthungi and Tervingi fell out of use shortly after 400.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> In general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after it entered the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Wolfram believes that because the term Greuthungi was a geographical identifier the terminology dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/><ref name=\"Burns44\">Burns, 44.</ref> In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians north of the Ister.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\">Wolfram, 387 n57.</ref> Wolfram concludes that it was the Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\"/> On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.<ref name=\"Burns44\"/>\n\nThat the Greuthungi were the Ostrogothi is an idea derived from the medieval writer [[Jordanes]].<ref>Heather, 52&ndash;57, 300&ndash;301.</ref> He identified the Ostrogothic kings from [[Theodoric the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungian king [[Ermanaric]]. Although Jordanes' explanation of the family succession is in direct conflict with the more reliable and contemporary information of Ammianus, there has been a long tradition of scholarly attempts to reconcile the two accounts, but these have not succeeded in creating any consensus.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=147}} [[Peter Heather]] for example has written that the \"Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name\".<ref>{{citation|year=2007|last=Heather |first=Peter|title=Linguistic and Literary Traces of the Ostrogoths, The Ostrogoths from the Migration Period to the Sixth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|editor-last1=Barnish |editor-last2=Marazzi|series=Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology|volume=7|ref=harv|isbn=9781843830740 |page=404}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n*[[Ermanaric]] ({{circa}} 370s), King\n*[[Vithimiris]] ({{circa}} 376), King\n*[[Alatheus and Saphrax]] ({{floruit}} 376\u2013387), chieftains\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Greuthungi Wall]]\n* [[Thervingi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Ostrogoths]]\n[[Category:History of the North Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:History of the western steppe]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Chernyakhov.PNG|right|250px|thumb|\n{{legend|#0f0|[[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|[[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark culture]] in the early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]] in the early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe '''Greuthungs''', '''Greuthungi''', or '''Greutungi''' were a [[Goths|Gothic]] people of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between the [[Dniester River|Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers, in the 3rd and the 4th centuries.<ref name=\"Heather\">{{cite book |last1=Heather |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Heather |date=2018 |chapter=Greuthungi |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-2131? |editor1-last=Nicholson |editor1-first=Oliver  |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |pages= |isbn=9780191744457 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=January 26, 2020  |ref=}}</ref> \n\nThey had close contacts with the [[Tervingi]], another Gothic people, who lived west of the Dniester River.

After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">Wolfram387&ndash;388 n58.</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung for example, has proposed that it may mean \"rock people\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the [[Geats|Gauts]] in what is today Sweden.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> \n\nIt has also been noted by some scholars, starting with [[Karl M\u00fcllenhoff]] in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of [[Scandza]], [[Jordanes]] listed \"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\" among those who \"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\".<ref name=chr>Latin and translation given at {{cite book|last=Christensen |first=Arne S\u00f8by|title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002| location=Copenhagen|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |ref=harv|pages=267-268}}</ref> M\u00fcllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the terms.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=296\u2013298}}\n\n==History==\n{{see|Ostrogoths#History}}\n\nThe first event which classical authors clearly describe as involving the Greuthungi was the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366), as described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Novidunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor [[Gratian]]. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report a last great event in which the Greuthungi went under that name, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn time and geographical area, the Greutungi and their neighbours, the Thervingi, correspond to the archaeological [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52-54.</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nChernyakhov cemeteries include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials in which the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54-56.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Ostrogoths==\nThe Tervingi were first attested by 291, indicating that different Gothic peoples already had distinct identities and names by that time.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\">Wolfram, 24.</ref> The Greuthungi are first named by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], writing no earlier than 392 and perhaps later than 395.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> The earliest events where he describes the Grethungi were in the 360s.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}} The Ostrogoths, are also first mentioned in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greutungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|loc=p.24 & p.387 fn52}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} \n\nDespite such records which seem to show the Ostrogoths and Greutungi as distinct, according to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greutungi or [[Vesi]]/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> When the names were used together, Wolfram argues that it is significant that the pairing was always preserved, as in ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/>\n\nThe nomenclature of Greuthungi and Tervingi fell out of use shortly after 400.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> In general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after it entered the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Wolfram believes that because the term Greuthungi was a geographical identifier the terminology dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/><ref name=\"Burns44\">Burns, 44.</ref> In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians north of the Ister.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\">Wolfram, 387 n57.</ref> Wolfram concludes that it was the Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\"/> On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.<ref name=\"Burns44\"/>\n\nThat the Greuthungi were the Ostrogothi is an idea derived from the medieval writer [[Jordanes]].<ref>Heather, 52&ndash;57, 300&ndash;301.</ref> He identified the Ostrogothic kings from [[Theodoric the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungian king [[Ermanaric]]. Although Jordanes' explanation of the family succession is in direct conflict with the more reliable and contemporary information of Ammianus, there has been a long tradition of scholarly attempts to reconcile the two accounts, but these have not succeeded in creating any consensus.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=147}} [[Peter Heather]] for example has written that the \"Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name\".<ref>{{citation|year=2007|last=Heather |first=Peter|title=Linguistic and Literary Traces of the Ostrogoths, The Ostrogoths from the Migration Period to the Sixth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|editor-last1=Barnish |editor-last2=Marazzi|series=Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology|volume=7|ref=harv|isbn=9781843830740 |page=404}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n*[[Ermanaric]] ({{circa}} 370s), King\n*[[Vithimiris]] ({{circa}} 376), King\n*[[Alatheus and Saphrax]] ({{floruit}} 376\u2013387), chieftains\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Greuthungi Wall]]\n* [[Thervingi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Ostrogoths]]\n[[Category:History of the North Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:History of the western steppe]]\n", "name_user": "Andrew Lancaster", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greuthungi"}

In 1981 the uniforms changed to blue trousers, blue shirt and a blue jacket with tie for winter.  In 1983 a padded winter jacket with reflective stripes replaced the blue jacket.  Ties were discontinued at that time as they were impractical in the field.  In 1995 a light green shirt, teamed with dark green pants and jacket was introduced.
