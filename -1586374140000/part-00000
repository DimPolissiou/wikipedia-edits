Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, e.g. Morocco, India, and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1-0.4%). They are used extensively for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content around 0.4-1.8%, so are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crop.cri.nz/psp/broadshe/coriand.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404072132/http://www.crop.cri.nz/psp/broadshe/coriand.htm|archivedate=4 April 2004|title=Coriander \u2013 Coriandrum sativum|author=Bruce Smallfield|date=June 1993}}</ref>\n\nCoriander is commonly found both as whole dried seeds and in [[milling (grinding)|ground]] form.

Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, e.g. Morocco, India, and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1-0.4%). They are used extensively for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content around 0.4-1.8%, so are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crop.cri.nz/psp/broadshe/coriand.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404072132/http://www.crop.cri.nz/psp/broadshe/coriand.htm|archivedate=4 April 2004|title=Coriander \u2013 Coriandrum sativum|author=Bruce Smallfield|date=June 1993}}</ref>\n\nCoriander is commonly found both as whole dried seeds and in [[milling (grinding)|ground]] form.

He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to [[Evans Brothers]], Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc). One of them, ''Thursday Adventure'' (1955) was filmed as ''[[The Stolen Airliner]]'' (1955).<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/pudney_john 'John Pudney' in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'']</ref> They featured classic front cover and internal illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.<ref>[https://www.aces-high.com/artists/view/ley-kenyon Aces High: Aviation Gallery]</ref> The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton. Both series were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. \n\nMost significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], which Evans published in 1950 attracting much attention. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of ''The Great Escape'' this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951).

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction (particularly aeronautical) became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971).<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref> \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F.

''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> In 1953 Pudney wrote the script for the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction (particularly aeronautical) became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971).<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref> \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F. Perkins|Victor Perkins]] in the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries Tessa Perkins obituary in ''The Guardian'', 4 November 2004]</ref> Their son, [[Toby Perkins]], is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''The Trampoline'' (1959)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

Beginning in 1965, WEEI-FM began carrying \"The Young Sound\", an [[easy listening]] format focusing on instrumental versions of recent pop tunes, which aired on many of CBS's FM [[owned-and-operated station]]s. By 1969, \"The Young Sound\" had evolved to an automated Top 40/[[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] hybrid format, with [[voice tracking|voice tracked]] announcements by Dick Provost. In late 1972, WEEI-FM flipped to [[adult contemporary]], then evolved into its famous \"Soft Rock\" format in 1977, which remained in place until 1983. During the Soft Rock years, WEEI-FM's playlist was limited to the softer hits of rock-oriented artists, artists heard only on Top 40 stations were not aired.\n\n=== First Top 40 era ===\nBy 1981, all of the other owned-and-operated CBS FM radio stations were carrying the \"[[Hot Hits]]\" format, supervised by programmer Mike Joseph, except for [[WCBS-FM]] in [[New York City]]. Unlike its sister stations, though, WEEI-FM played hits from the past several years as well as the hits of the current day. At midnight on March 9, 1983, WEEI-FM changed its [[call sign]] to WHTT, and re-branded as \"HitRadio 103\", and then \"Power 103\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://formatchange.com/1033-weei-fm-becomes-hitradio-whtt/|title=103.3 WEEI-FM becomes Hit Radio WHTT|date=1983-03-09|website=Format Change Archive|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\nWHTT continued with a Top 40 format until 7 p.m. on July 7, 1986. Because WHTT was involved in a three-way Top 40 battle with [[WXKS-FM]] and [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]], they launched an adult rock format known as ''Boston's Quality Rock'', playing a blend of softer [[Album Rock]] cuts, some pop songs and some eclectic [[smooth jazz]]. The station's call sign changed to WMRQ, branded on-air as \"Q-103\".<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-07-11.pdf</ref><ref>[https://formatchange.com/whtt-becomes-q103-wmrq/ WHTT Becomes WMRQ]</ref> The air staff stayed on from WHTT initially, though most gradually left over the next year.\n\n===Oldies era===\nOn October 7, 1987, the station switched to an [[oldies]] format, playing the Rock and Roll Hits from 1955 to 1969, and was branded as ''\"Oldies 103\"''. The first song on ''\"Oldies 103\"'' was \"[[Fun Fun Fun]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]].<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-10-16.pdf</ref> The station had a very deep playlist, playing a larger number of songs than most oldies stations. The station's call letters were soon changed to WODS to reflect the oldies format. WMRQ's airstaff stayed with the station despite the format change, and a couple people continued at the station right up to the station's final day in 2012. By 1989, WODS was also playing a very limited amount of music from the early 1970s up to 1972 mixed with the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs time went on, WODS added more 1970s music but continued to focus on the 1960s and still played a considerable number of pre-1964 oldies. In the late 1990s, the station rebranded as \"Oldies 103.3\". In 2001, WODS began to move away from 1950s' music. The station added more late 1970s songs and a few 1980s hits. In 2001, ''Little Walter's Time Machine'' was replaced with the Boston-based syndicated show ''[[The Lost 45s]]'', the program's host [[Barry Scott]] stayed with the station until WODS's final day, when he became the first to be hired away by long-time rival [[WROR-FM]]. In 2002, WODS eliminated most of the pre-64 oldies and by 2005, WODS was half 1964-1969 and half 1970-1979 with a few pre-1964 oldies and 1980s' songs mixed in.\n\nIn 2005, there were rumors CBS was planning to switch one of its Boston FM stations to [[Adult Hits]] as \"[[Jack FM]]\" which had been successful in a number of other radio markets, WODS was one of those stations under consideration, similar Oldies stations in [[WBMX (FM)|Chicago]], [[WQSR|Baltimore]], and [[WCBS-FM|New York]] had flipped at the same time. These rumors were rendered moot when Entercom-owned [[WEEI-FM|WQSX (93.7 FM)]] switched to Adult Hits as \"93.7 Mike FM\" instead on April 14, 2005.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, WODS only played moderate amounts of [[Christmas music]] during the holiday season and did not go wall to wall, even on Christmas Day. Beginning in the early 1990s, the station began wall to wall Christmas music on Christmas Eve and continued until Christmas evening. Beginning in 2003, WODS played holiday music from a week before Thanksgiving until Christmas Day. However, in 2007, it started its Christmas music on Monday November 12, and in 2008, it commenced on Thursday, November 6, the earliest it has ever been. This tradition was continued in 2009 with Christmas music playing on Friday, November 13, and it started on Thursday, November 18 in 2010. In 2011, Christmas music began on Friday, November 11.\n\nWODS added [[HD Radio]] operations in 2006. 103.3 HD1 carried the standard analog radio format, 103.3 HD2 carried a \"[[soft rock]]\" format known as \"The Cove,\" and 103.3 HD3 carried a simulcast of [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]]. After the sign on of \"[[WBZ-FM|98.5 The Sports Hub]]\" on August 13, 2009, the simulcast moved to the HD3 channel of 98.5, while 103.3 HD3 flipped to [[Christian rock]], branded as \"Mercy Rock: The Christian Rock of Boston.\"\n\nIn 2007, WODS added ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The '70s Saturdays'' nights at 11:00 p.m. and ''The [[Wolfman Jack]] Show'' Sunday nights at 11:00 p.m. In October 2008, WODS switched nights for the two shows and added a second airing of \"AT40:70s\" on Sunday mornings at 10. The 2-hour version (second and third hours) played in the morning and the entire 3-hour version played at night. In 2009, the morning broadcast was dropped with AT40: 70s airing only Sundays at midnight.\n\nIn 2008, WODS added [[Tom Kent]]'s nationally syndicated show weeknights from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. As a result, the Top 20 Countdown, a Thursday night staple on WODS for many years, was moved to Saturdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. with Patrick Callahan as host as of October 4, 2008. ''The Top 20 Countdown'' was originally known as the ''Thursday Night Countdown'', with hosts including Sandy Benson, Patrick Callahan and J.J. Wright. Tom Kent's syndicated show only lasted a few months and was replaced with local programming again.\n\nIn October 2009, WODS changed its station branding from ''\"Oldies 103.3\"'' to ''\"103.3 WODS\"''. At that point, WODS began focusing on hits from 1970 to 1984, with only a few 1960s songs per hour. The station also played an occasional 1990s song as well. However, this adjustment did more to hurt than help in the ratings.\n\nOver the years, WODS produced numerous free summer concerts starting at the steps of [[Boston City Hall Plaza]] in 1988 before moving to the larger [[Hatch Memorial Shell]] in May 1996. Acts who have performed as part of the concert series include [[Chubby Checker]] (August 11, 1990), [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] (August 4, 1990), [[The Monkees]], [[Peter Cetera]], [[Bobby Vee]] (July 7, 1990), [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]] (July 14, 1990), [[The Cadillacs]] & [[The Chiffons]]] (both July 21, 1990), [[The Jive Five]] & [[The Del-Vikings]] (both July 28, 1990), and dozens more. The final concert lineup during the summer of 2012 included [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Burton Cummings]] (of [[The Guess Who]]) and [[Rick Springfield]].\n\n===Notable WODS on-air personalities===\n* [[Frank Kingston Smith]]\n* [[Barry Scott]] of [[The Lost 45s]]\n\n===Second Top 40 era===\n[[File:WODS logo.png|thumb|103.3 AMP Radio logo used from 2012 to 2018.]]\nOn June 27, 2012, CBS announced that the station would flip back to Top 40 as \"103.3 AMP Radio\" the following day at Noon. Within hours of the announcement, the air staff was laid off and the station began to run jockless, with recorded liners thanking loyal listeners of WODS and advising them that \"Boston's Greatest Hits\" would move to its HD2 subchannel. One of the now-unemployed DJs, Paula Street (who had been with WODS since February 1988), confirmed on the Radio-Info Boston message board [http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php?topic=214763.0] that a goodbye show for the format would happen before the flip at Noon.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-blows-up-bostons-classic-hits-wods-to-create-chr-1033-amp \"CBS blows up Boston's classic hits WODS, to create CHR '103.3 Amp'\"] from Radio-Info (June 27, 2012)</ref>\n\nThe last show of ''The Breakfast Club'' with John Laurenti and Karen Blake took place on June 28, 2012, concluding with one \"last song\" by them. Jay Gordon, Barry Scott, and both Paula Street and J.J. Wright each followed on-air, playing their last respective songs for WODS, Street and Wright's selection, ''Fun Fun Fun'' by The Beach Boys, was WODS's first song as a oldies station. Following a half-hour [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with songs either with \"time\" or \"change\" in the title or overall theme, the station went into a five-minute long introductory montage, culminating with the launch of \"AMP Radio\" at 12:00 p.m.\n\nAs a consequence of the format change, the classic hits format moved to WODS-HD2, displacing \"The Cove\". WODS-HD3 played Christmas music during the 2012 holiday season, replacing the \"Mercy Rock\" format, which moved to WBMX-HD3, it would be replaced with a revived \"The Cove\" that following January.\n\nFormer ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' co-host TJ Taormina became the host of the station's morning drive show on April 1, 2013.<ref>{{Cite

Beginning in 1965, WEEI-FM began carrying \"The Young Sound\", an [[easy listening]] format focusing on instrumental versions of recent pop tunes, which aired on many of CBS's FM [[owned-and-operated station]]s. By 1969, \"The Young Sound\" had evolved to an automated Top 40/[[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] hybrid format, with [[voice tracking|voice tracked]] announcements by Dick Provost. In late 1972, WEEI-FM flipped to [[adult contemporary]], then evolved into its famous \"Soft Rock\" format in 1977, which remained in place until 1983. During the Soft Rock years, WEEI-FM's playlist was limited to the softer hits of rock-oriented artists, artists heard only on Top 40 stations were not aired.\n\n=== First Top 40 era ===\nBy 1981, all of the other owned-and-operated CBS FM radio stations were carrying the \"[[Hot Hits]]\" format, supervised by programmer Mike Joseph, except for [[WCBS-FM]] in [[New York City]]. Unlike its sister stations, though, WEEI-FM played hits from the past several years as well as the hits of the current day. At midnight on March 9, 1983, WEEI-FM changed its [[call sign]] to WHTT, and re-branded as \"HitRadio 103\", and then \"Power 103\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://formatchange.com/1033-weei-fm-becomes-hitradio-whtt/|title=103.3 WEEI-FM becomes Hit Radio WHTT|date=1983-03-09|website=Format Change Archive|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\nWHTT continued with a Top 40 format until 7 p.m. on July 7, 1986. Because WHTT was involved in a three-way Top 40 battle with [[WXKS-FM]] and [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]], they launched an adult rock format known as ''Boston's Quality Rock'', playing a blend of softer [[Album Rock]] cuts, some pop songs and some eclectic [[smooth jazz]]. The station's call sign changed to WMRQ, branded on-air as \"Q-103\".<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-07-11.pdf</ref><ref>[https://formatchange.com/whtt-becomes-q103-wmrq/ WHTT Becomes WMRQ]</ref> The air staff stayed on from WHTT initially, though most gradually left over the next year.\n\n===Oldies era===\nOn October 7, 1987, the station switched to an [[oldies]] format, playing the Rock and Roll Hits from 1955 to 1969, and was branded as ''\"Oldies 103\"''. The first song on ''\"Oldies 103\"'' was \"[[Fun Fun Fun]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]].<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-10-16.pdf</ref> The station had a very deep playlist, playing a larger number of songs than most oldies stations. The station's call letters were soon changed to WODS to reflect the oldies format. WMRQ's airstaff stayed with the station despite the format change, and a couple people continued at the station right up to the station's final day in 2012. By 1989, WODS was also playing a very limited amount of music from the early 1970s up to 1972 mixed with the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs time went on, WODS added more 1970s music but continued to focus on the 1960s and still played a considerable number of pre-1964 oldies. In the late 1990s, the station rebranded as \"Oldies 103.3\". In 2001, WODS began to move away from 1950s' music. The station added more late 1970s songs and a few 1980s hits. In 2001, ''Little Walter's Time Machine'' was replaced with the Boston-based syndicated show ''[[The Lost 45s]]'', the program's host [[Barry Scott]] stayed with the station until WODS's final day, when he became the first to be hired away by long-time rival [[WROR-FM]]. In 2002, WODS eliminated most of the pre-64 oldies and by 2005, WODS was half 1964-1969 and half 1970-1979 with a few pre-1964 oldies and 1980s' songs mixed in.\n\nIn 2005, there were rumors CBS was planning to switch one of its Boston FM stations to [[Adult Hits]] as \"[[Jack FM]]\" which had been successful in a number of other radio markets, WODS was one of those stations under consideration, similar Oldies stations in [[WBMX (FM)|Chicago]], [[WQSR|Baltimore]], and [[WCBS-FM|New York]] had flipped at the same time. These rumors were rendered moot when Entercom-owned [[WEEI-FM|WQSX (93.7 FM)]] switched to Adult Hits as \"93.7 Mike FM\" instead on April 14, 2005.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, WODS only played moderate amounts of [[Christmas music]] during the holiday season and did not go wall to wall, even on Christmas Day. Beginning in the early 1990s, the station began wall to wall Christmas music on Christmas Eve and continued until Christmas evening. Beginning in 2003, WODS played holiday music from a week before Thanksgiving until Christmas Day. However, in 2007, it started its Christmas music on Monday November 12, and in 2008, it commenced on Thursday, November 6, the earliest it has ever been. This tradition was continued in 2009 with Christmas music playing on Friday, November 13, and it started on Thursday, November 18 in 2010. In 2011, Christmas music began on Friday, November 11.\n\nWODS added [[HD Radio]] operations in 2006. 103.3 HD1 carried the standard analog radio format, 103.3 HD2 carried a \"[[soft rock]]\" format known as \"The Cove,\" and 103.3 HD3 carried a simulcast of [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]]. After the sign on of \"[[WBZ-FM|98.5 The Sports Hub]]\" on August 13, 2009, the simulcast moved to the HD3 channel of 98.5, while 103.3 HD3 flipped to [[Christian rock]], branded as \"Mercy Rock: The Christian Rock of Boston.\"\n\nIn 2007, WODS added ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The '70s Saturdays'' nights at 11:00 p.m. and ''The [[Wolfman Jack]] Show'' Sunday nights at 11:00 p.m. In October 2008, WODS switched nights for the two shows and added a second airing of \"AT40:70s\" on Sunday mornings at 10. The 2-hour version (second and third hours) played in the morning and the entire 3-hour version played at night. In 2009, the morning broadcast was dropped with AT40: 70s airing only Sundays at midnight.\n\nIn 2008, WODS added [[Tom Kent]]'s nationally syndicated show weeknights from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. As a result, the Top 20 Countdown, a Thursday night staple on WODS for many years, was moved to Saturdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. with Patrick Callahan as host as of October 4, 2008. ''The Top 20 Countdown'' was originally known as the ''Thursday Night Countdown'', with hosts including Sandy Benson, Patrick Callahan and J.J. Wright. Tom Kent's syndicated show only lasted a few months and was replaced with local programming again.\n\nIn October 2009, WODS changed its station branding from ''\"Oldies 103.3\"'' to ''\"103.3 WODS\"''. At that point, WODS began focusing on hits from 1970 to 1984, with only a few 1960s songs per hour. The station also played an occasional 1990s song as well. However, this adjustment did more to hurt than help in the ratings.\n\nOver the years, WODS produced numerous free summer concerts starting at the steps of [[Boston City Hall Plaza]] in 1988 before moving to the larger [[Hatch Memorial Shell]] in May 1996. Acts who have performed as part of the concert series include [[Chubby Checker]] (August 11, 1990), [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] (August 4, 1990), [[The Monkees]], [[Peter Cetera]], [[Bobby Vee]] (July 7, 1990), [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]] (July 14, 1990), [[The Cadillacs]] & [[The Chiffons]]] (both July 21, 1990), [[The Jive Five]] & [[The Del-Vikings]] (both July 28, 1990), and dozens more. The final concert lineup during the summer of 2012 included [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Burton Cummings]] (of [[The Guess Who]]) and [[Rick Springfield]].\n\n===Notable WODS on-air personalities===\n* [[Frank Kingston Smith]]\n* [[Barry Scott]] of [[The Lost 45s]]\n\n===Second Top 40 era===\n[[File:WODS logo.png|thumb|103.3 AMP Radio logo used from 2012 to 2018.]]\nOn June 27, 2012, CBS announced that the station would flip back to Top 40 as \"103.3 AMP Radio\" the following day at Noon. Within hours of the announcement, the air staff was laid off and the station began to run jockless, with recorded liners thanking loyal listeners of WODS and advising them that \"Boston's Greatest Hits\" would move to its HD2 subchannel. One of the now-unemployed DJs, Paula Street (who had been with WODS since February 1988), confirmed on the Radio-Info Boston message board [http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php?topic=214763.0] that a goodbye show for the format would happen before the flip at Noon.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-blows-up-bostons-classic-hits-wods-to-create-chr-1033-amp \"CBS blows up Boston's classic hits WODS, to create CHR '103.3 Amp'\"] from Radio-Info (June 27, 2012)</ref>\n\nThe last show of ''The Breakfast Club'' with John Laurenti and Karen Blake took place on June 28, 2012, concluding with one \"last song\" by them. Jay Gordon, Barry Scott, and both Paula Street and J.J. Wright each followed on-air, playing their last respective songs for WODS, Street and Wright's selection, ''Fun Fun Fun'' by The Beach Boys, was WODS's first song as a oldies station. Following a half-hour [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with songs either with \"time\" or \"change\" in the title or overall theme, the station went into a five-minute long introductory montage, culminating with the launch of \"AMP Radio\" at 12:00 p.m.\n\nAs a consequence of the format change, the classic hits format moved to WODS-HD2, displacing \"The Cove\". WODS-HD3 played Christmas music during the 2012 holiday season, replacing the \"Mercy Rock\" format, which moved to WBMX-HD3, it would be replaced with a revived \"The Cove\" that following January.\n\nFormer ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' co-host TJ Taormina became the host of the station's morning drive show on April 1, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/115232/tj-taormina-grabs-mornings-at-boston-s-103-3-amp-r|title=TJ Taormina Grabs Mornings At Boston's 103.3 Amp Radio|website=All Access|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\nOn February 2, 2017, [[CBS Radio]] announced it would merge with [[Entercom]] (which locally owned [[WEEI (AM)|WEEI]], [[WEEI-FM]], [[WRKO]], [[WKAF]], and [[WKVB (FM)|WAAF]]).<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/116299/cbs-radio-to-merge-with-entercom/ CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom]</ref> WODS, [[WWBX|WBMX]], WEEI-AM-FM and WAAF were retained by Entercom, while sister stations [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] and [[WZLX]], as well as WKAF and WRKO, were spun off to [[iHeartMedia]] ([[WBZ-FM]] was then traded to [[Beasley Broadcast Group]] in exchange for [[WMJX]]).<ref>https://radioinsight.com/headlines/120711/entercom-trades-boston-seattle-spin-offs-iheartmedia-richmond-chattanooga-2/</ref><ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/120699/entercom-swaps-98-5-sports-hub-boston-beasley-magic-106-7/ Entercom Swaps 98.5 the Sports Hub to Beasley for Magic 106.7]</ref> The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entercom.com/press/entercom-receives-fcc-approval-merger-cbs-radio/|title=Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio|work=Entercom|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/121072/entercom-completes-cbs-radio-merger/|title=Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger|last=Venta|first=Lance|work=Radio Insight|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn February 26, 2019, it was reported that Entercom was flipping HD channels in six markets, including WODS-HD2 (replacing the oldies/classic hits format), to its \"[[Channel Q]]\" network, which carries a [[talk radio|talk]] and [[dance music]] format aimed at the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/174791/channel-q-expands-to-six-more-markets/|title=Channel Q Expands To Six More Markets|date=2019-02-26|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Morning host TJ Taormina left the station on April 3, 2020. <ref>{{cite news |title=Entercom Announces Layoffs, Furloughs And Pay Cuts For Employees |work=RadioInsight |publisher=RadioBB Networks |date=2020-4-3}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite web\n|title = WODS(FM)\n|work = The Boston Radio Dial\n|publisher = The Archives at BostonRadio.org\n|author = George, Peter (in part)\n|url = http://www.bostonradio.org/stations/9639.html\n|accessdate = 2006-02-20\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://1033ampradio.radio.com 103.3 AMP Radio website]\n*{{FM station data|WODS}}\n\n{{Boston Radio}}\n{{Contemporary Hit Radio Stations in Massachusetts}}\n{{Entercom}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Boston|ODS]]\n[[Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1948]]\n[[Category:1948 establishments in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Entercom radio stations]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add leading zero to ISO date", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WODS"}

They were also surrounded by territories controlled by Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|pp=495\u2013505}} Colonial military forces in Africa were relatively small, poorly equipped and had been created to maintain internal order, rather than conduct military operations against other colonial forces. Most of the European warfare in Africa during the 19th century had been conducted against African societies to enslave people and later to conquer territory. The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 had provided for European colonies in Africa to be [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] if war broke out in Europe; in 1914 none of the European powers had plans to challenge their opponents for control of overseas colonies. When news of the outbreak of war reached European colonialists in Africa, it was met by little of the enthusiasm seen in the capital cities of the states which maintained colonies.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=496}} An editorial in the ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|East African Standard]]'' on 22 August argued that Europeans in Africa should not fight each other but instead collaborate, to maintain the repression of the indigenous population. War was against the interest of the white colonialists because they were small in number, many of the European conquests were recent, unstable and operated through existing local structures of power and the organisation of African economic potential for European profit had only recently begun.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=496}}{{efn|In the short term, colonialist fears of loss of prestige and the consequences of a re-militarisation of Africans were exaggerated. The war increased collaboration between European colonialists and Africans and eroded local social structures, leading to a much slower development of a class of urban, western-educated, politically aware Africans.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=496}}}}\n\nIn Britain, an Offensive sub-committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] was appointed on 5 August and established a principle that command of the seas was to be ensured and that objectives were considered only if they could be attained with local forces and if the objective assisted the priority of maintaining British sea communications, as British army garrisons abroad were returned to Europe in an \"Imperial Concentration\". Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. The objectives were at Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam in Africa and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea, which were considered vulnerable to attack by local or allied forces and in the Far East, which led to the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==North Africa==\n{{Main|North African operations during World War I}}\n\n===Zaian War, 1914\u20131921===\n{{Main|Zaian War}}\nAttempts were made by Germany and the Ottomans to influence conditions in the French colonies by intriguing with the potentates who had been ousted by the French.

Morocco had become a French protectorate in 1912 and the French army extended French influence eastwards through the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains towards [[French Algeria]]. The Zaians, led by [[Mouha ou Hammou Zayani]] quickly lost the towns of [[Taza]] and [[Kh\u00e9nifra]] but managed to inflicted many casualties on the French, who responded by establishing {{lang|fr|groupes mobiles}}, [[combined arms]] formations of regular and irregular infantry, cavalry and artillery.

The [[A\u00efr Sultanate|Sultan of Agadez]] convinced the French that the Tuareg confederations remained loyal and Kaocen's forces besieged the garrison on 17 December 1916.  Kaocen, his brother Mokhtar Kodogo and {{circa|1,000}} Tuareg raiders, armed with rifles and a field gun captured from the Italians in Libya, defeated several French relief columns. The Tuareg seized the main towns of the A\u00efr, including [[Ingall]], [[Assod\u00e9]] and [[Aouderas]]. Modern northern Niger came under rebel control for over three months. On 3 March 1917, a large French force from [[Zinder]] relieved the Agadez garrison and began to recapture the towns.

The British adopted a policy of containment given their slender resources and tried to keep Sayyid and his 6,000 supporters penned in eastern Somaliland, to encourage desertion and ruthless killings of his own men by Sayyid, which succeeded.

Through terrorism and enslavement, the Portuguese quashed the rebellion by the end of the year. Repercussions of the rising continued as British administrators in Northern Rhodesia in 1918 struggled to compensate local civilians for war service, particularly during the famine of 1917\u20131918.

Press gangs (''cipais'') used the most brutal coercion to mobilise whole populations, young, old and infirm people not being exempted and women being raped. By the end of 1916, many young men had fled to Southern Rhodesia and Transvaal to escape the Portuguese and to earn living wages. The condition of the populations left behind worsened to the point that when the ''cipais'' tried to raise another 5,000 carriers from the kingdom of Barue in March 1917, the population rebelled. Disgust at Portuguese depredations united many peoples but the rivals for the title of Makombe of the Wabarue fought independent campaigns, attracting support from the bandits in the Zambesi valley. At the end of April, the rebels routed a Portuguese force sent to suppress the rising and reached the provincial capital of [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]]; by the end of May had overrun most of [[Zambezia Province]]. About 100,000 people crossed the border into British [[Nyasaland]] and the Rhodesian colonies to escape the violence but the disruption did little to alter British disdain for Portuguese methods and despite having received troops to help put down the Chilembwe rebellion, they refused to send troops, only allowing guns and ammunition over the border. In May the Portuguese began to suppress the rebels by butchering thousands of people, enslaving women and plundering territory. The rebels held out into November and the rivals for the title of Makombe fled to [[Southern Rhodesia]]. During June the Portuguese had to divide their forces and send thousands of Portuguese and local troops to attack the Makonde living on the Mvua plateau, who had also rebelled.{{sfn|Paice|2009|pp=320\u2013321}} Another rebellion broke out early in 1918.{{sfn|Paice|2009|pp=368, 375}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nThe war marked the end of the German colonial empire; during the war, the Entente powers posed as crusaders for liberalism and enlightenment but little evidence exists that it was seen as such by Africans. Many African soldiers fought on both sides, with a loyalty to military professionalism, rather than nationalism and porters had mainly been attracted by pay or had been coerced. The war had been the final period of the [[Scramble for Africa]]; control and annexation of territory had been the principal war aim of the Europeans and the main achievement of Lettow-Vorbeck, had been to thwart some of the ambitions of the South African colonialists.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=643}} In the [[Treaty of Versailles|post-war settlements]], Germany's colonies were divided between Britain, Belgium, Portugal and South Africa.

They were also surrounded by territories controlled by Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|pp=495\u2013505}} Colonial military forces in Africa were relatively small, poorly equipped and had been created to maintain internal order, rather than conduct military operations against other colonial forces. Most of the European warfare in Africa during the 19th century had been conducted against African societies to enslave people and later to conquer territory. The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 had provided for European colonies in Africa to be [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] if war broke out in Europe; in 1914 none of the European powers had plans to challenge their opponents for control of overseas colonies. When news of the outbreak of war reached European colonialists in Africa, it was met by little of the enthusiasm seen in the capital cities of the states which maintained colonies.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=496}} An editorial in the ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|East African Standard]]'' on 22 August argued that Europeans in Africa should not fight each other but instead collaborate, to maintain the repression of the indigenous population.

Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. The objectives were at Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam in Africa and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea, which were considered vulnerable to attack by local or allied forces and in the Far East, which led to the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==North Africa==\n{{Main|North African operations during World War I}}\n\n===Zaian War, 1914\u20131921===\n{{Main|Zaian War}}\nAttempts were made by Germany and the Ottomans to influence conditions in the French colonies by intriguing with the potentates who had been ousted by the French.

Press gangs (''cipais'') used the most brutal coercion to mobilise whole populations, young, old and infirm people not being exempted and women being raped. By the end of 1916, many young men had fled to Southern Rhodesia and Transvaal to escape the Portuguese and to earn living wages. The condition of the populations left behind worsened to the point that when the ''cipais'' tried to raise another 5,000 carriers from the kingdom of Barue in March 1917, the population rebelled. Disgust at Portuguese depredations united many peoples but the rivals for the title of Makombe of the Wabarue fought independent campaigns, attracting support from the bandits in the Zambesi valley. At the end of April, the rebels routed a Portuguese force sent to suppress the rising and reached the provincial capital of [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]]; by the end of May had overrun most of [[Zambezia Province]]. About 100,000 people crossed the border into British [[Nyasaland]] and the Rhodesian colonies to escape the violence but the disruption did little to alter British disdain for Portuguese methods and despite having received troops to help put down the Chilembwe rebellion, they refused to send troops, only allowing guns and ammunition over the border. In May the Portuguese began to suppress the rebels by butchering thousands of people, enslaving women and plundering territory.

The eight generation family consists of: 7\" (2012 model), 8.9\" (2012 model), 7\" (2013 model), 6\" & 7\" (2014 models), 8\" & 10.1\" (2015 models), 8\" (2016 model), 8\" & 10.1\" (2017 models), 8\" (2018 model) and 10.1\" (2019 model). These devices run the [[Fire OS]] operating system.\n\n==History==\nThe first model was announced on September 6, 2012 and was available in two versions, 7\" and 8.9\".  The 7\" model was released in United States on September 14, then France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom on October 25 and in Japan on December 18. The 8.9\" model was released on November 20 in United States, in Japan on March 12, 2013 in Germany on March 13, and in India on June 27.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/09/kobo-new-ereaders/|title=Kobo Announces Their New E-Readers|first=|last=Jules|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"amazones\">[https://www.amazon.es/s/?__mk_es_ES=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD Amazon.es: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonit\">[https://www.amazon.it/s/?__mk_it_IT=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0 Amazon.it: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonfr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/s/?__mk_fr_FR%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Amazon.fr : Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonde\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/s/?__mk_de_DE%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Suchergebnis auf Amazon.de f\u00fcr: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.de}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonuk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0|title=Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Fire HD second generation was released. The price of the Fire HD 7\" was reduced to $139, the processor speed was upgraded to 1.5&nbsp;GHz, upgraded from \"Android based\" OS to a compatible [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Android named [[Fire OS]] 3, removed the front camera, used a new form factor and decreased the available storage options. In addition, the Fire HD's successor the [[Kindle Fire HDX]] was introduced.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, the Fire HD third generation was released, which is part of the Fire Tablet's fourth generation, with 6-inch and 7-inch [[touchscreen]] sizes. In addition, the Fire HD Kids Edition was released, which is the same device as the Fire HD 6 except it comes with a case and one-year subscription to Kindle Freetime apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-kindle-fire-tablets/|title=Amazon Kindle Cheat Sheet|work=CNET|accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was officially removed from the tablets' name.\n\nIn September 2015, Amazon released a new range of Fire tablets with 7, 8, and 10.1 inch sizes. The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.\n\nIn 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.\n\nIn September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.\n\nOn October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference \u2014 September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers. The 7\" model's speakers are dual-driver, while the 8.9\" model's are single-driver.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The device has two Wi-Fi antennas on the [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands]] which utilize [[MIMO]] to improve reception.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The Fire HD also added [[Bluetooth]] connectivity allowing users to connect an array of wireless accessories including keyboards.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The first generation models have an HDMI port, but this is missing from future generations.\n\nIn June 2016, Amazon released a version of the Fire HD 10 that has an aluminum exterior instead of plastic like the other Fire tablets, and is available at the same price as the plastic version.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/2/11838204/amazon-adds-metal-fire-10-64gb Amazon now sells a metal version of its Fire 10 tablet] The Verge Retrieved 2 June 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Software ===\nThe 2012 models use software that introduced user profiles for sharing among family members and the ability to place absolute limits on total usage or usage of individual features, called FreeTime, and tracks the user's reading speed to predict when the user will finish a chapter or book. The OS is based on a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"]]. This does not allow use of [[Google Play]], limiting the number of apps accessible for the Fire HD.

Note that although this version is called the Fire HD 7\", it is not the successor to the original Fire HD. This model is the successor to the Fire second generation. The Fire HD models second generation were updated to FireOS 4.1.1, based on Android 4.4.4, in Q3 2014.\n\nThe Fire HD 6\" and 7\" third generation uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>\n\nThe Fire HD 8 and 10 fifth generation uses Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\" and was released in late 2015.

The eight generation family consists of: 7\" (2012 model), 8.9\" (2012 model), 7\" (2013 model), 6\" & 7\" (2014 models), 8\" & 10.1\" (2015 models), 8\" (2016 model), 8\" & 10.1\" (2017 models), 8\" (2018 model) and 10.1\" (2019 model). These devices run the [[Fire OS]] operating system.\n\n==History==\nThe first model was announced on September 6, 2012 and was available in two versions, 7\" and 8.9\".  The 7\" model was released in United States on September 14, then France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom on October 25 and in Japan on December 18. The 8.9\" model was released on November 20 in United States, in Japan on March 12, 2013 in Germany on March 13, and in India on June 27.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/09/kobo-new-ereaders/|title=Kobo Announces Their New E-Readers|first=|last=Jules|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"amazones\">[https://www.amazon.es/s/?__mk_es_ES=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD Amazon.es: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonit\">[https://www.amazon.it/s/?__mk_it_IT=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0 Amazon.it: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonfr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/s/?__mk_fr_FR%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Amazon.fr : Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonde\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/s/?__mk_de_DE%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Suchergebnis auf Amazon.de f\u00fcr: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.de}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonuk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0|title=Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Fire HD second generation was released. The price of the Fire HD 7\" was reduced to $139, the processor speed was upgraded to 1.5&nbsp;GHz, upgraded from \"Android based\" OS to a compatible [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Android named [[Fire OS]] 3, removed the front camera, used a new form factor and decreased the available storage options. In addition, the Fire HD's successor the [[Kindle Fire HDX]] was introduced.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, the Fire HD third generation was released, which is part of the Fire Tablet's fourth generation, with 6-inch and 7-inch [[touchscreen]] sizes. In addition, the Fire HD Kids Edition was released, which is the same device as the Fire HD 6 except it comes with a case and one-year subscription to Kindle Freetime apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-kindle-fire-tablets/|title=Amazon Kindle Cheat Sheet|work=CNET|accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was officially removed from the tablets' name.\n\nIn September 2015, Amazon released a new range of Fire tablets with 7, 8, and 10.1 inch sizes. The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.\n\nIn 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.\n\nIn September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.\n\nOn October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference \u2014 September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers. The 7\" model's speakers are dual-driver, while the 8.9\" model's are single-driver.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The device has two Wi-Fi antennas on the [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands]] which utilize [[MIMO]] to improve reception.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The Fire HD also added [[Bluetooth]] connectivity allowing users to connect an array of wireless accessories including keyboards.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The first generation models have an HDMI port, but this is missing from future generations.\n\nIn June 2016, Amazon released a version of the Fire HD 10 that has an aluminum exterior instead of plastic like the other Fire tablets, and is available at the same price as the plastic version.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/2/11838204/amazon-adds-metal-fire-10-64gb Amazon now sells a metal version of its Fire 10 tablet] The Verge Retrieved 2 June 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Software ===\nThe 2012 models use software that introduced user profiles for sharing among family members and the ability to place absolute limits on total usage or usage of individual features, called FreeTime, and tracks the user's reading speed to predict when the user will finish a chapter or book. The OS is based on a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"]]. This does not allow use of [[Google Play]], limiting the number of apps accessible for the Fire HD.

Note that although this version is called the Fire HD 7\", it is not the successor to the original Fire HD. This model is the successor to the Fire second generation. The Fire HD models second generation were updated to FireOS 4.1.1, based on Android 4.4.4, in Q3 2014.\n\nThe Fire HD 6\" and 7\" third generation uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>\n\nThe Fire HD 8 and 10 fifth generation uses Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\" and was released in late 2015.

Their bodies consist of [[mesoglea]], a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of [[epithelium]] that are mostly one [[cell (biology)|cell]] thick. \n\nThey have two basic body forms: swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e and [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s, both of which are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] with mouths surrounded by [[Tentacle|tentacles]] that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for [[digestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]-like zooids, or both (hence they are [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]]). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized [[nerve net]] and [[Sensory neuron|simple receptors]]. Several free-swimming species of [[Cubozoa]] and [[Scyphozoa]] possess balance-sensing [[statocyst]]s, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], with many species having complex life cycles of [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.\n\nCnidarians were formerly grouped with [[ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Casey W.|last2=Leys|first2=Sally P.|last3=Haddock|first3=Steven H.D.|title=The hidden biology of sponges and ctenophores|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=May 2015|volume=30|issue=5|pages=282\u2013291|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.003|pmid=25840473}}</ref> Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] ([[jellyfish]]); [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', and colonial swimmers, such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] were firmly recognized as cnidarians in 2007.<ref name=\"E.

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book| author1=Ruppert, E.E.| author2=Fox, R.S.| author3=Barnes, R.D.| last-author-amp=yes| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=978-0-03-025982-1| year=2004| pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103 103\u2013104]| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

[[Sensory neuron|Sensory]] cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells,<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> and communicate via [[synapse]]s (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with [[motor nerve]] cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Some form a simple [[nerve net]].\n*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=Sjlkerjerojoyu6atterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more.

Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light.

Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]].

For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''. Springer. p. 223, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbaBQm_ZQkIC&lpg=PA223&dq=alternation%20of%20generations%20cnidaria&hl=pt-BR&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=alternation%20of%20generation%20&f=false].</ref> is sometimes called \"alternation of asexual and sexual phases\" or \"metagenesis\", but should not be confused with the [[alternation of generations]] as found in plants.\n\nShortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. [[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].

Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for [[digestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]-like zooids, or both (hence they are [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]]). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized [[nerve net]] and [[Sensory neuron|simple receptors]]. Several free-swimming species of [[Cubozoa]] and [[Scyphozoa]] possess balance-sensing [[statocyst]]s, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], with many species having complex life cycles of [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.\n\nCnidarians were formerly grouped with [[ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Casey W.|last2=Leys|first2=Sally P.|last3=Haddock|first3=Steven H.D.|title=The hidden biology of sponges and ctenophores|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=May 2015|volume=30|issue=5|pages=282\u2013291|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.003|pmid=25840473}}</ref> Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] ([[jellyfish]]); [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', and colonial swimmers, such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]].

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=SatterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most Cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system.<ref name=SatterlieControl>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A|date=2002-10-01|title=Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1654\u20131669|doi=10.1139/z02-132|issn=0008-4301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be8fbb5d133e10d7e2bdd85989085b73bbee2c7e}}</ref> As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light.

Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n===Regeneration===\nAll cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\n{{Annotated image| float=right| caption=Life cycle of a [[jellyfish]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /><br>'''1\u20133''' Larva searches for site<br>'''4\u20138''' Polyp grows<br>'''9\u201311''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]<br>'''12\u201314''' Medusa grows| image=Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg| width=193| image-width=200| height=292| annot-font-weight=bold| annot-background-color=yellow| annot-font-size=10\n| annotations=\n{{Annotation|100|231|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|60|232|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|9|232|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|4|260|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|40|260|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|78|260|&nbsp;6&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|120|260|&nbsp;7&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|151|216|&nbsp;8&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|166|147|&nbsp;9&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|104|159|&nbsp;10&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|50|162|&nbsp;11&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|29|38|&nbsp;12&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|87|60|&nbsp;13&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|161|62|&nbsp;14&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n}}\n\n===Sexual===\n\nCnidarian [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''.

[[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].
