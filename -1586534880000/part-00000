In ''[[High Diving Hare]]'' (1948), when [[Yosemite Sam]] cuts through a high diving board [[Bugs Bunny]] is standing on, the ladder and platform that Sam is on falls, leaving the cut plank suspended in mid-air. Bugs turns to the camera and cracks: \"I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law!\"\n\nMore recently, it has been explicitly described by some cartoon characters, including [[Roger Rabbit]], [[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers D. Bobcat]], and [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], who say that [[cartoon|toon]]s are allowed to bend or break natural laws for the purposes of comedy. Doing this is extremely tricky, so toons have a natural sense of comedic timing, giving them inherently funny properties.\n\nIn ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', for example, Roger is unable to escape handcuffs for most of a sequence, doing so only to use both hands to hold the table still while Eddie Valiant attempts to saw the cuff off. When Eddie asks, exasperated, \"Do you mean to tell me you could've taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?!\" Roger responds: \"Not at ''any'' time!

Coyote's ability to temporarily suspend the law of gravity while describing the United States' structural gap between revenue and spending: \"The crisis won't come immediately. For a few years, America will still be able to borrow freely, simply because lenders assume that things will somehow work out...But at a certain point we'll have a Wile E. Coyote moment. For those not familiar with the Road Runner cartoons, Mr. Coyote had a habit of running off cliffs and taking several steps on thin air before noticing that there was nothing underneath his feet. Only then would he plunge. What will that plunge look like?\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul |title=Don't Look Down |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/opinion/don-t-look-down.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Cartoon physics'' is not limited to physics: For example, when a character recovers impossibly fast from a serious injury, the laws of [[biology]] rather than physics are being altered. \n\nIt is also not limited to cartoons. Live-action shows and movies can also be subject to the laws of cartoon physics explaining why, for example, [[The Three Stooges]] did not go blind from all the eye-poking, or the burglars in the ''[[Home Alone (franchise)|Home Alone]]'' series survive life-threatening booby traps. In a review of one of the ''Home Alone'' films, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that in the case of live-action productions, cartoon physics are not as effective at producing a comic effect, as the effects seem more realistic:\n\n{{quote|Most of the live-action attempts to duplicate animation have failed, because when flesh-and-blood figures hit the pavement, we can almost hear the bones crunch, and it isn't funny.<ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |coauthors= |title=Home Alone 2: Lost in New York |work=rogerebert.com |page= |date=1992-11-20 |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |quote= |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921120/REVIEWS/211200302/1023}}</ref>}}\n\n[[The Lexicon of Comicana|Printed cartoons]] have their own family of cartoon physics \"laws\" and conventions.\n\nAdditionally, some [[video games]] utilize these elements during their cutscenes.

{"title_page": "Belongingness", "text_new": "'''Belongingness''' is the human [[emotional]] [[need]] to be an accepted member of a [[group (sociology)|group]]. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, a religion, or something else, people tend to have an 'inherent' desire to belong and be an important part of something greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong is the need to give and receive attention to and from others.\n\nBelonging is a strong and inevitable feeling that exists in [[human nature]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} To belong or not to belong can occur due to choices of one's self, or the choices of others. Not everyone has the same life and interests, hence not everyone belongs to the same thing or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify themselves as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to their surroundings.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Roy Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary]] argue that belongingness is such a fundamental human [[motivation]] that we feel severe consequences of not belonging. If it wasn\u2019t so fundamental, then lack of belonging wouldn\u2019t have such dire consequences on us. This desire is so universal that the need to belong is found across all cultures and different types of people.<ref>Baumeister & Leary | need to belong, p. 499</ref>\n\n==Psychological needs==\n[[Abraham Maslow]] suggested that the need to belong was a major source of human motivation. He thought that it was one of 5 human needs in his [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], along with physiological needs, safety, [[self-esteem]], and [[self-actualization]]. These needs are arranged on a [[hierarchy]] and must be satisfied in order. After physiological and safety needs are met an individual can then work on meeting the need to belong and be loved. According to Maslow, if the first two needs are not met, then an individual cannot completely love someone else.\n\nOther theories have also focused on the need to belong as a fundamental psychological motivation. According to [[Roy Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary]], all human beings need a certain minimum quantity of regular, satisfying social interactions. Inability to meet this need results in [[loneliness]], [[mental distress]], and a strong desire to form new relationships.<ref name=\"Baumeister\">{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 497\u2013529 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497 | pmid = 7777651 }}</ref> Several psychologists have proposed that there are individual differences in people's motivation to belong. People with a strong motivation to belong are less satisfied with their relationships and tend to be relatively lonely.  As consumers, they tend to seek the opinions of others about products and services and also attempt to influence others' opinions.\n\nAccording to Baumeister and Leary, much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness. They argue that many of the human needs that have been documented, such as the needs for [[Need for power|power]], [[intimacy]], approval, [[Need for achievement|achievement]] and [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]], are all driven by the need to belong. Human culture is compelled and conditioned by pressure to belong. The need to belong and form [[Attachment theory|attachments]] is universal among humans. This counters the [[Freud]]ian argument that [[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality|sexuality]] and [[aggression]] are the major driving psychological forces. Those who believe that the need to belong is the major psychological drive also believe that humans are naturally driven toward establishing and sustaining relationships and belongingness. For example, interactions with strangers are possible first steps toward non-hostile and more long-term interactions with strangers that can satisfy the need for attachments. Certain people who are socially deprived can exhibit physical, behavioral, and psychological problems, such as stress or instability. These people are also more likely to show an increase in aiming to form new attachments.\n\n===Attachments===\nIn all [[culture]]s, attachments form universally. Social bonds are easily formed, without the need for favorable settings. The need to belong is a goal-directed activity that people try to satisfy with a certain minimum number of social contacts. The quality of interactions is more important than the quantity of interactions. People who form social attachments beyond that minimal amount experience less satisfaction from extra relationships, as well as more [[stress (psychological)|stress]] from terminating those extra relationships. People also effectively replace lost relationship partners by substituting them with new relationships or social environments. For example, individuals with strong family ties could compensate for loneliness at work.\n\nRelationships missing regular contact but characterized by strong feelings of commitment and intimacy also fail to satisfy the need. Just knowing that a [[Affectional bond|bond]] exists may be emotionally comforting, yet it would not provide a feeling of full belongingness if there is a lack of interaction between the persons. The belongingness hypothesis proposes two main features. First, people need constant, positive, personal interactions with other people. Second, people need to know that the bond is stable, there is mutual concern, and that this attachment will continue. So, the need to belong is not just a need for intimate attachments or a need for connections, but that the perception of the bond is as important as the bond itself. Individuals need to know that other people care about their [[well-being]] and love them.\n\nBaumeister and Leary argue that much of the research on group bonds can be interpreted through the lens of belongingness. They argue that plenty of evidence suggests that social bonds are formed easily. In the classic [[Robber's Cave study]], stranger boys were randomly grouped into two different groups and almost immediately, group identification and strong [[loyalty]] developed to their specific group. Initially, the two groups were asked to compete with one another, and hostility between the groups ensued. However, when the two groups were combined to form one big group and were given the opportunity to bond by working together to accomplish [[superordinate goals]], [[behaviors]] and [[emotions]] accommodated quickly to that new group. In an attempt to understand causes of [[in-group favoritism]], researchers formed{{Citation needed|reason=needs a reference, it is not mentioned in the Robber's Cave study article and its not clear whether it refers to that study or some other|date=April 2019}} a group so [[Minimal group paradigm|minimal]] and insignificant that one would expect that no favoritism would be found, yet in-group favoritism appeared immediately. Researchers agree that banding together against a threat (the [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]) and sharing rewards are primary reasons groups form and bond so easily. Mere [[The Proximity Principle|proximity]] is another powerful factor in relationship formation. Just like babies form attachments with their [[caregivers]], people develop attachments just because they live near one another. This suggests that proximity sometimes overcomes the tendencies to bond with others who are similar to us. Positive social bonds form just as easily under fearful circumstances, such as military veterans who have undergone heavy battle together. This can be explained by either [[Misattribution of arousal|misattribution]] (interpreting feelings of anxious arousal as feelings of attraction for another person) or [[reinforcement theory]] (the presence of another person reduces distress and elicits positive responses). Baumeister and Leary argue that the reinforcement theory explanation provides evidence for the importance of belonging needs because these learned associations create a tendency to seek out the company of others in times of threat. The formation of [[Attachment theory|social attachments]] with former rivals is a great indicator of the need to belong. Belonging motivations are so strong that they are able to overcome competitive feelings towards opponents.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople form such close attachments with one another that they are hesitant in breaking social bonds. Universally, people distress and protest ending social relationships across all cultures and age spans.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P. R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1\u201322 | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1 }}</ref> Even temporary groups, such as training groups, struggle with the idea that the group may eventually dissolve. The group may have fulfilled their purpose, but the participants want to cling on to the relationships and social bonds that have been formed with one another. The group members make promises individually and collectively to stay in touch, plan for future reunions, and take other steps to ensure the continuity of the attachment. For example, two people may not speak for an entire year, but continue exchanging holiday cards. People do not want to risk damaging a relationship or breaking an attachment, because it is distressing.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople are so hesitant in breaking social bonds that in many cases, they are hesitant to dissolve even bad relationships that could be potentially destructive. For example, many women are unwilling to leave their abusive spouses or boyfriends with excuses ranging from liking for the abuse to economic self-interests that are more important than physical harm.<ref>Roy, M. (Ed.). (1977). ''Batter women.'' New York: Van Nostrand.\n</ref> This unwillingness to leave an abusive partner, whether mentally or physically, is just another indicator of the power of the need to belong and how reluctant individuals are to break these bonds. Breaking off an attachment causes pain that is deeply rooted in the need to belong.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople experience a range of both positive and negative emotions; the strongest emotions linked to attachment and belongingness. [[Empiricism|Empirical]] evidence suggests that when individuals are accepted, welcomed, or included it leads those individuals to feel positive emotions such as happiness, elation, calm, and satisfaction. However, when individuals are rejected or excluded, they feel strong negative emotions such as [[anxiety]], [[jealousy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and grief. In fact, the psychological pain caused by social rejection is so intense that it involves the same brain regions involved in the experience of physical pain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = MacDonald | first1 = G. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M. R. | year = 2005 | title = Why does social exclusion hurt? The relationship between social and physical pain | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 2| pages = 202\u2013223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.2.202 | pmid = 15740417 }}</ref> Both positive and negative reactions in emotion are connected to status of relationship. The existence of a social attachment changes the way one emotionally responds to the actions of a relationship partner and the emotions have the potential to intensify.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nLack of constant, positive relationships has been linked to a large range of consequences. People who lack belongingness are more prone to behavioral problems such as [[criminality]] and [[suicide]] and suffer from increasing mental and physical illness. Based on this evidence, multiple and diverse problems are caused by the lack of belongingness and attachments. It therefore seems appropriate to regard belongingness and attachments as a need rather than simply a want.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nRelationships that are centrally important in the way people think are [[interpersonal relationships]]. The belongingness hypothesis suggests that people devote much of their cognitive thought process to interpersonal relationships and attachments. For example, researchers found that people store information in terms of their [[Social Bonding Theory|social bonds]], such as storing more information about a marriage partner as opposed to a work acquaintance. People also sort out-group members on the basis of characteristics, traits, and duties, whereas they sort in-group members on person categories. Cognitive processing organizes information by the person they have a connection with as opposed to strangers. Researchers had a group of people take turns reading out-loud and they found that they had the greatest [[Recall (memory)|recall]] for the words they personally spoke, as well for words spoken by dating partners or close friends. There is a [[Cognition|cognitive]] merging of the self with specific people that is followed by the need to belong. Flattering words that are said to a spouse can enhance the self just as positively. People always believe that nothing bad can happen to themselves, and extend that thought to their family and friends.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nThere is an emotional implication to belongingness in which positive affect is linked to increases in belongingness while negative affect is linked to decreases in belongingness. Positive emotions are associated with forming social attachments, such as the experience of falling in [[love]], as long as the love is mutual. [[Unrequited love]] (love without belongingness) usually leads to disappointment whereas belongingness in love leads to joy.  Occasions such as childbirth, new employment, and fraternity/sorority pledging are all associated with the formation of new social attachments surrounded by positive emotions. Forming bonds is cause for joy, especially when the bond is given a permanent status, such as a wedding. Weddings signify permanent commitment and complete the social bond by committing to the spouse's need to belong. Positive experiences shared emotions increases attraction with others. Close personal attachments, a rich network of friends and high levels of intimacy motivation are all correlated to happiness in life.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nThe breaking of social bonds and threats to those bonds are primary sources of negative affect. People feel anxious, depressed, guilty or lonely when they lose important relationships. Social exclusion is the most common cause of anxiety. [[Anxiety]] is a natural consequence of being separated from others. Examples include children suffering from [[Separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]] from being separated from their mothers. Adults act similarly when their loved ones leave for a period of time. Memories of past rejection and imagining [[social rejection]] all elicit negative emotions. Losses of attachments lead directly to anxiety. If people are excluded from [[social groups]], people get anxious, yet the anxiety is removed when they experience social inclusion. Failing to feel accepted can lead to social and general depression. Depression and anxiety are significantly correlated. [[Social exclusion]] is also a major cause of jealousy, which is a common reaction when one's relationships are threatened. Jealousy is cross-culturally universal and in all cultures, sexual jealousy is common. It was said earlier that belongingness needs can only truly be met with [[Social network|social contact]], but social contact by itself does not shield people against loneliness. Loneliness matters more when there is a lack of intimacy as opposed to lack of contact. Another negative affect is guilt, which is caused to make the other person want to maintain the relationship more, such as paying more attention to that person.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nDivorce and death are two negative events that spoil the need to belong. Divorce causes distress, anger, loneliness, and depression in almost everyone. The death of oneself and other people are the most traumatic and stressful events that people can experience. Death can cause severe depression, which is not a reaction to the loss of the loved one, but because there is a loss of the attachment with that other person. For example, a death of a spouse in which there was marriage problems can still elicit in extreme sadness at the loss of that attachment. Death is linked to anxiety and fear of loneliness. The idea of being separated from friends and family, and not the fact that they would no longer exist on this earth, is what brings about this anxiety.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\n==Evolutionary perspectives==\nOne reason for the need to belong is based on the theory of [[Evolutionary psychology|evolution]]. In the past belonging to a group was essential to survival: people hunted and cooked in [[Social group|groups]]. Belonging to a group allowed tribe members to share the workload and protect each other. Not only were they trying to ensure their own survival, but all members of their tribe were invested in each other's outcomes because each member played an important role in the group. More recently in Western society, this is not necessarily the case. Most people no longer belong to tribes, but they still protect those in their groups and still have a desire to belong in groups.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\">Fiske, S.T. (2004). ''Social beings: A core motives approach to social psychology.'' United States of America: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\"Baumeister\" />\n\nThe need to belong is rooted in evolutionary history. Human beings are social animals. Humans have matured over a long period of time in dyadic and group contexts. Humans evolved in small groups that depended on close social connections to fulfill survival and reproductive needs.<ref name = \"Dewall\" /> Unlike other species, humans receive most of what they need from their social group rather than directly from his or her natural environment, suggesting that the human strategy for survival depends on belonging.<ref name = \"Stillman\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Stillman | first1 = T.

In contrast, lacking belonging and being excluded is perceived as painful and has a variety of negative effects including, [[shame]], [[anger]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name = \"Newman\" /> Because belongingness is a central component of human functioning, [[Social rejection|social exclusion]] has been found to influence many [[behavioral]], [[cognitive]], and [[emotional]] outcomes. Given the negative consequences of social exclusion and social rejection, people developed traits that function to prevent rejection and encourage acceptance.<ref name = \"Dewall\" />\n\n==Self-presentation==\nTo be accepted within a group, individuals may convey or conceal certain parts of their [[Personality|personalities]]. This is known as ''[[self-presentation]]''.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\" /><ref><span class=\"citation book\">Schlenker, B. R. (1980).

In general, individuals seek out those who are most [[similarity (psychology)|similar]] to them.<ref>Berscheid, E., & Reis, H. T. (1998). Attraction and close relationships.  In D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, G. Lindzey (Eds.), ''The handbook of social psychology, Vols. 1 and 2 (4th ed.)'' (pp. 193-281). New York, NY US: McGraw-Hill.</ref> People like to feel that they can relate to someone and those who are similar to them give them that feeling. People also like those that they think they can understand and who they think can understand them.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\" />\n\n===Social connections===\nThe desire to form and maintain social bonds is among the most powerful human motives. If an individual's sense of social connectedness is threatened, their ability to self-regulate suffers. [[Social relationships]] are important for human functioning and [[well-being]] therefore, research on how social relationships affect people's personal interests and motivated behavior has been a focus of numerous studies. Walton, Cohen, and Spencer for example, believed that a mere sense of social connectedness (even with people who were unfamiliar) can cause one to [[internalize]] the goals and motivations of others. By doing so, this shapes people's motivated behavior suggesting achievement motivation and one's self-identity are highly sensitive to minor cues of social connection. Mere belonging is defined as an entryway to a social relationship, represented by a small cue of social connection to an individual or group. Social belonging is a sense of relatedness connected to a positive, lasting, and significant interpersonal relationship. While mere belonging is a minimal or even chance social connection, social belonging factors are characterized as social feedback, [[Social validation|validation]], and shared experiences. Sharing common goals and interests with others strengthens positive social bonds and may enhance feelings of self-worth.<ref name=\"Walton\">{{cite journal | last1 = Walton | first1 = G.

Their belonging uncertainty idea suggests that in academic and professional settings, members of socially stigmatized groups are more uncertain of the quality of their social bonds. Therefore, they feel more sensitive to issues of social belonging. They believe in domains of achievement, belonging uncertainty can have large effects on the motivation of those challenging with a threatened social identity.<ref name = \"WaltonCohen\">{{cite journal | last1 = Walton | first1 = G.

Conformity is the act of changing one's actions, attitudes, and behaviors to match the norms of others. Norms are unsaid rules that are shared by a group. The tendency to conform results from direct and indirect social pressures occurring in whole societies and in small groups. There are two types of conformity motivations known as [[informational social influence]] and [[normative social influence]]. Information social influence is the desire to obtain and form accurate information about reality. Information social influence occurs in certain situations, such as in a crisis.  This information can be sought out by other people in the group or experts. If someone is in a situation where they do not know the right way to behave, they look at the cues of others to correct their own behavior. These people conform because the group interpretation is more accurate than your own.  Normative social influence is the desire to obtain social approval from others. Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be accepted by members of a group, since the need to belong is in our human desire. When people do not conform, they are less liked by the group and may even be considered deviant. Normative influence usually leads to public compliance, which is fulfilling a request or doing something that one may not necessarily believe in, but that the group believes in.<ref name=\"Cialdini\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = N.

Individuals are more likely to conform to groups who describe out-group members with [[stereotype]] traits, even though don\u2019t publicly express their agreement. People desire to gain approval so they conform to others. The beliefs held by others and how we react to those beliefs is often reliant on our view of the amount of agreement for those beliefs. Researchers are interested in exploring informational and normative motivational influences to conform on [[majorities]] and minorities. Objective consensus theory suggests that majority influence of a group is informational, while [[Conversion theory of minority influence|conversion theory]] views it as normative. Normative influences may be the underlying motivations behind certain types of conformity; however, researchers believe that after time, informational influences such as confidence in the accuracy of one's intergroup norms is positively correlated with distinguished level of compromise.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" />\n\nOutside the conscious mind, a type of conformity is behavioral mimicry, otherwise known as the chameleon effect. Behavioral mimicry is when individuals mimic behaviors such as [[facial expressions]], [[Posture (psychology)|postures]], and mannerisms between other individuals. Researchers found that individuals [[subconscious]]ly conformed to the mannerisms of their partners and friends and liked these partners more who mirrored them. This is important in regard to [[rapport]] building and forming new social relationships-we mirror the behaviors we are supposed to, to get to where we want to belong in the group. People are motivated to conform to gain social approval and enhance and protect their own self-esteems. However, people who wish to combat conformity and fight that need to belong with the majority group can do so by focusing on their own [[self-worth]] or by straying from the attitudes and norms of others{{clarify|date=December 2018}}. This can establish a sense of uniqueness within an individual. Yet, most individuals keep positive assessments of themselves and still conform to valued groups.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" />\n\n===Self-regulation===\nWhen our belongingness needs are not met, Wilkowski and colleagues (2009) suggest that self-regulation is used to fulfill one's need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkowski | first1 = B.

Self-regulation can occur in many different ways. One of these ways uses other individual's gaze(s) as a reference to understand how attention should be divided. This effect is especially seen within individuals that have low levels of self-esteem. Interpersonal acceptance is not met in individuals with low self-esteem, which prompts them to self-regulate by looking to others for guidance with regards to where to focus attention. Belongingness contributes to this level of self-esteem. Baumeister, Dewall, Ciarocco, and Twenge (2005) found that when people are socially excluded from a group, self-regulation is less likely to be than those who have a heightened sense of belonging.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

Later, those participants were offered a plate of cookies. The participants that were told that nobody in the group wanted to work with them took more cookies than those who were not told this information, which provides evidence that a lack of belongingness inhibits people's ability to self-regulate. Self-regulation includes impulse control and allows one to manage short-term impulses and have a heightened sense of belongingness within an [[ingroup]]. An ingroup is a social group in which a person psychologically defines themselves as being a member of that specific group. By being a part of this group, one has a better ability to self-regulate.\n\n===Peer networks===\nAs the span of relationships expands from childhood into adolescence, a sense of peer group membership is likely to develop. Adolescent girls have been found to value group membership more and are more identified with their peer groups than boys. Adolescent girls tend to have a higher number of friends than boys. They expect and desire more nurturing behavior from their friends. Girls experience more self-disclosure, more empathy, and less overt hostility compared to boys. A study found that girls use ruminative coping, which involves perseverating on the negative feelings and the unpleasant situations associated with problems. Boys on the other hand, tend to be less intimate and have more activity based friendships. Boys do not benefit as much as girls from feelings of belonging that are a product of enduring and close friendships. They are less vulnerable to the emotional distress that is likely to accompany high levels of co-rumination and disclosure.<ref name = \"Newman\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = B.

For example, allowing the individual to become part of the group or by paying more attention to the individual is a [[positive reinforcement]]. This is a source of motivation for the individual to repeat the activity or engage in other approved activities. Adolescents have also been observed to choose friendships with individuals who engage in similar activities to those that they are involved in. This provides the individual with more opportunities to engage in the activity therefore the peer group may influence how often the individual engages in the activity. To feel a sense of belonging and fit in, adolescents often conform to activities of a particular group by participating in the same activities as members of the peer group.<ref name=\"Bauman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bauman | first1 = K.

To capture an adolescent's self-perception of group affiliation one may ask an adolescent to identify themselves as a member of a group or discuss whether they belong in a group. An affective aspect of group belongingness includes feelings of being proud of one's group and being a valued group member. The affective nature of a sense of group belonging has been found to be the most internally consistent. It is important to find out how important it is for an adolescent to be a member of a group because not all adolescents are equally concerned about being part of a group. Those who strongly desire to be in a peer group and do not experience a sense of group belonging are expected to have the greatest social distress and are likely to report the most behavior problems.<ref name = \"Newman\" />\n\n===Schooling===\nA sense of belonging to a social peer group can enhance students academic achievement.<ref>Anderman, L.

At a college level, a better sense of belonging has been linked to perceived professor caring and greater involvement in campus organizations. In a study exploring associations between a sense of school belonging and academic and psychological adjustment, Pittman and Richmond found that college students who reported a greater sense of belonging at a college level, were doing better academically and felt more competent scholastically but also had a higher self-worth and lower levels of externalizing problems. However, students who were having problems with their relationships with friends, were found to experience more internalizing behaviors and feel less connected to the college.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pittman | first1 = L.

Participation refers to behavior, whilst identification relates to affect or a sense of belonging. While school attachment involves a student's connection to school, school community incorporates belonging, meaning that in order to be a part of any community (including a school community), a person first needs to have feelings of belonging <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Osterman|first=Karen F.|date=2000|title=Students' Need for Belonging in the School Community|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=70|issue=3|pages=323\u2013367|doi=10.3102/00346543070003323|issn=0034-6543|jstor=1170786}}</ref>\n\nBlum and Libbey <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blum|first=Robert Wm.|last2=Libbey|first2=Heather P.|date=September 2004|title=Executive Summary|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=74|issue=7|pages=231\u2013232|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2004.tb08278.x|issn=0022-4391}}</ref> characterize school connectedness as a student's perception that teachers, along with other adults in the school community, show a concern for the pupils' learning, pay attention to who the student is as an individual, and also have high academic expectations. Furthermore, school connectedness involves a student having a sense of safety at school as well as positive student-teacher relationships.\n\nDespite the slight differences in meaning, these terms commonly include three aspects: they refer to school-based relationships and experiences,  they involve the relationship between students and teachers, and they include a student's general feelings about school as a whole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA large number of variables have been found to be significantly associated with school belonging. This has made it difficult to present a theoretical model of school belonging. A comprehensive meta-analysis  <ref name=\":1\"/> uncovered 10 themes that influence school belonging at the student level during adolescence in educational settings:\n\n* Academic motivation\n* Emotional stability\n* Personal characteristics\n* Parent support \n* Teacher support\n* Peer support\n* Gender, race and ethnicity\n* Extracurricular activities\n* Environmental/school safety\n\nThe meta-analysis found that teacher support and positive personal characteristics are the strongest predictors of school belonging <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhilst theories pertaining to general \u2018belongingness\u2019 can also be applied to school belonging, theories of belonging generally imply that belonging comes about because an individual is motivated to meet the fundamental need to belong and to achieve meaningful social relations. However, school belonging is slightly different. Schools can help students to develop a sense of belonging because they are in a position to develop social networks. School belonging is affected by the school\u2019s social and organisational culture.\n\nThe fact that school belonging, by its very nature, is affected by the wider environment, it is consistent with Bronfenbrenner\u2019s <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hardcastle|first=Beverly|last2=Byrnes|first2=Deborah|last3=Bartlett|first3=Andrea|last4=Denton|first4=Penelope|last5=Walsh|first5=Patrick R.|date=May 1981|title=The Ecology of Human Development\u2014Experiments by Nature and Designby Urie Bronfenbrenner.

These frameworks put forward the theory that children\u2019s development takes place within the systems in society, and that these systems interact. Every child is at the center of multiple levels of influence. It has been argued that a social-ecological lens is the most adequate lens with which to view the construct of school belonging, given the large number of variables at play, and also the unique nature of school belonging for both the individual and the school.\n\nAt school, students are a part of a greater whole influenced by both formal and informal groupings, and overarching systems that are common and typically represented within all schools. Thus, school belonging can be conceptualized as a multi-layered, socio-ecological phenomena, consisting of several interacting layers. This is depicted in the figure.\n\n[[File:School Belongings.png|thumb]]\n\nThe innermost layer of the construct is the individual level. This describes the unique student characteristics that contribute to the sense of belonging, including personality and mental health. The micro-system refers to network an individual has that are informal, such as family, friends, teachers, and peers with whom the student interacts with. The mesosystem refers to organisational factors, including school resources, processes, policies, rules and practices. The exosystem refers to the broader school community. Finally, the macro-system involves the legislation, history and social climate of a society. This socio-ecological framework has been developed from empirical studies, and provides schools with a thorough direction in which to foster school belonging\n\nGiven that school belonging is largely about perception, social belonging interventions such as those suggested by Walton and Brady <ref>{{Citation|chapter=Barriers, Possibilities, and How Sociology Can Help|pages=25\u201348|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781412978101|doi=10.4135/9781483387314.n2|title=How Can We Solve Our Social Problems?|year=2011}}</ref> have therefore been found to be useful. They argue that these interventions provide students with an adaptive lens with which to make sense of adversities in school. For minority students, challenges at school can give rise to feelings of non-belonging.\n\nOne such social intervention described by Walton and Brady sees stories used, whereby difficulties at school are portrayed as a normal part of education. Rather than attributing challenges as a sign that one doesn\u2019t belong, the stories acknowledge group-based difficulties, but show how these experiences are not necessarily a barrier to ultimately belonging and succeeding.\n\nOne group that may have the feelings of non-belonging that challenges can lead to, is those of a racial minority. The students who are from minority groups may attribute challenges \u2013 both academic and otherwise \u2013 to their racial identity. Social support is essential for improving belonging, most especially for students from minority backgrounds for whom acceptance by peers, teachers and parents is an important behavior of pro-social behavior and a positive attitude towards school.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galliher|first=Renee Vickerman|last2=Rostosky|first2=Sharon Scales|last3=Hughes|first3=Hannah K.|date=June 2004|title=School Belonging, Self-Esteem, and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents: An Examination of Sex, Sexual Attraction Status, and Urbanicity|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=33|issue=3|pages=235\u2013245|doi=10.1023/b:joyo.0000025322.11510.9d|issn=0047-2891}}</ref>\n\n===Workplace===\nThe need to belong is especially evident in the workplace. Employees want to fit in at work as much as students want to fit in at school. They seek the approval and acceptance of leaders, bosses, and other employees. [[Charismatic authority|Charismatic leaders]] are especially known to show off [[organizational citizenship behavior]]s such as helping and compliance if they feel a sense of belongingness with their work group. Researchers found that charisma and belongingness increased cooperative behavior among employees. Charismatic leaders influence followers by bringing awareness to the collective unit and strengthening the feeling of belonging, and that enhances employees\u2019 compliance. [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s are employee activities that benefit the collective group without the individual gaining any direct benefit. Helping is a huge component of organizational citizenship behaviors because helping involves voluntarily assisting others with problems that are work-related and preventing other issues from arising. Task performance is enhanced and supported when the acts of helping in a work environment are established and evident. Charismatic leaders set a striking example for the way to organization should behave by reinforcing certain rules and values for the organization. These self-confident leaders inspire their followers to exceed expectations for the collective group instead of their own self-interest. This in turn gives employees an identity with which to belong.<ref name=\"Den Hartog\">{{cite journal | last1 = Den Hartog | first1 = D. N. | last2 = De Hoogh | first2 = A.

Belongingness and group membership encourages social groups with motivation to comply, cooperate, and help. [[Group cohesiveness|Cohesive]] work groups show more consideration, report positive relationships within the group and elicits more organizational citizenship behaviors. Also, an already cohesive and collective group makes people more inclined to comply with the rules of the workplace. Some people help each other in return for a future expected favor; however, most workings help because it is the \u201cright\u201d thing to do or because they like their leaders so much and wish to express this likeness. People are more receptive to a leader who provides a clear sense of direction and inspiration with the promise of a better future. Workers who feel more isolated in the workplace feel the need to belong even more than those who are not isolated because they are missing that collective feeling of unity. A workplace functions better as a collective whole.<ref name = \"Den Hartog\" />\n\n==Acceptance/rejection==\nThe need to belong is among the most fundamental of all personality processes. Given the negative consequences of [[social rejection]], people developed traits that function to encourage acceptance and to prevent rejection. But if the need to belong evolved to provide people with a means of meeting their basic needs for survival and reproduction based on evolutionary experiences, thwarting the need to belong should affect a variety of outcomes. Because it strikes at the core of human functioning, people respond very strongly to social exclusion.<ref name=\"Dewall\">{{cite journal | last1 = DeWall | first1 = C. | last2 = Deckman | first2 = T. | last3 = Pond | first3 = R.

Feeling disliked, excluded, unappreciated, or devalued can stir up negative emotions in an individual. Some of these negative emotions include a lower self-esteem, [[Aggression|aggressive]] actions and [[antisocial behavior]]. However, believing you are liked, included, appreciated, or valued elicits feelings of higher self-esteem and confidence boosts. A different number of events can lead individuals to feel accepted versus rejected. We can simply see the power of interpersonal acceptance and rejection when accepted vs. ostracized by a group, adored vs. abandoned by a romantic partner, or elected vs. defeated in an election.<ref name = \"Buckley\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Buckley | first1 = K.

Perceived relational evaluation is the degree to which you perceive others value having a relationship with you. You feel more accepted if another person or group regards your relationship with them as real and as important to them as it is to you. If they consider the relationship unimportant, you feel rejected and respond negatively.<ref name = \"Buckley\" />\n\nIn a series of experiments, Buckley, Winkel, and [[Mark Leary|Leary]] found that the effects of rejection are more potent than the effects of acceptance because negative feelings can cause more feelings of hurt and pain, which in turn can lead to aggression and negative behaviors. They also found people's reactions to extreme and moderate rejection were similar, suggesting that once one has been rejected by an individual or group, the severity of the rejection is less important<ref name = \"Buckley\" />\n\n===Procedural justice===\nProcedural justice, in terms of belongingness, according to van Prooijen and colleagues (2004), is the process by which people judge their level of belongingness in terms of their ability to contribute to a group.<ref name=\"Prooijen, J.

In other words, a person is more likely to believe and support fairness decisions made by members of an ingroup in which they feel like they are a part of, compared to an ingroup in which they do not feel as strongly connected. De Cremer and Blader (2006) found that when people feel a heightened sense of belongingness, they process information about procedural justice in a more careful and systematic way.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = De Cremer | first1 = D. | last2 = Blader | first2 = S.

Van Prooojen and colleagues (2004) found that fairness maintains an individual's sense of inclusion in social groups.<ref name=\"Prooijen, J. W. 2004\"/> Fairness can be used as an inclusion maintenance tool. Relationships are highly valued within groups, so members of those groups seek out fairness cues so they can understand these relationships. De Cremer and colleagues (2013) suggest that individuals with a high need to belong care more about procedural fairness information and therefore pay closer attention to incoming information. Furthermore, Cornelis, Van Hiel, De Cremer and Mayer (2013) propose that leaders of a group are likely to be more fair when they are aware that the followers of the group have a high need to belong versus a low need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cornelis | first1 = I. | last2 = Van Hiel | first2 = A. | last3 = De Cremer | first3 = D. | last4 = Mayer | first4 = D.

Leaders are also more fair in congruence with the amount of empathy they feel for followers. Empathetic leaders are more likely to pay attention to differences among followers, and to consider a follower's belongingness needs when making decisions. In addition, Cornelis, Van Hiel, & De Cremer (2012) discovered that leaders are more fair in granting their followers voice when the leader is aware that the follower has a high need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cornelis | first1 = I. | last2 = Van Hiel | first2 = A. | last3 = De Cremer | first3 = D. | year = 2012 | title = The effect of followers' belongingness needs on leaders' procedural fairness enactment: Mediation through interpersonal and team attraction | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201339 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000053 }}</ref> This occurs because of the attraction a leader feels to the follower and to the group. Leaders that are attracted to their followers and to the group are motivated by the follower's need to belong to allow them a greater voice in the group.\n\n==Culture==\nIn all cultures, the need to belong is prevalent. Although there are individual differences in the intensity and strength of how people express and satisfy the need, it is really difficult for culture to eradicate the need to belong.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" /> Collectivist countries are also more likely to conform and comply with the majority group than members in [[Individualistic culture|individualistic]] societies. Conformity is so important in collectivist societies that nonconformity can represent deviance in [[Mediterranean culture|Circum-Mediterranean cultures]], yet represent uniqueness in [[Sinosphere]] culture.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" /> Even early civilizations considered both exile and death as equal punishments. Individuals in other countries strive to belong so much that being exiled or shunned from their society is the biggest dishonor.<ref name = \"Dewall\" />\n\nMotivation to belong varies throughout different cultures, and can effect student achievement in distinct ways. In studies comparing fifteen year old students from 31 countries, the differences between Eastern and Western cultures were apparent. It is important to note that the study is in the perspective of dividing these countries into two groups. The study argues that Asian (eastern) cultures are collectivist, while Western cultures are more individualistic. In Western cultures, peer influence is more predominant while in Eastern cultures, they are more heavily influenced by their families. In a classroom setting, children from Eastern cultures are more competitive, giving them less of a drive to belong among their peers. These children have a great sense of motivation to excel and to do better than those around them which makes their needs for belongingness in a school setting less favorable. While in Western cultures, being so highly impacted by their peers, it gives them less of a drive to be competitive towards them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cortina|first=Kai S.|last2=Arel|first2=Sari|last3=Smith-Darden|first3=Joanne P.|date=2017|title=School Belonging in Different Cultures: The Effects of Individualism and Power Distance|journal=Frontiers in Education|language=English|volume=2|doi=10.3389/feduc.2017.00056|issn=2504-284X|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/147229/1/Cortina%2c%20Arel%2c%20Smith-Darden%202017.pdf}}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that Eastern and Western cultures continue to have one of the largest achievement gaps between them, with Eastern cultures outscoring the Western.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=39a686e4-b674-414a-a908-7d2efb16d2e8@sdc-v-sessmgr04|title=User Verification {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref> It can be hypothesized that the competitive, individualistic drive found in the classroom in Eastern cultures leads to more success. Furthermore, belongingness in Western cultures may have the potential to inhibit classroom success. However, it is very important to note that not all cultures respond to belongingness in the same way due to the many variations between cultures.\n\nFurthermore, stigmas can create a global uncertainty about the quality of an individual's social bonds in academically and professional areas. Walton and Cohen conducted two experiments that tested how belonging uncertainty undermines the achievement and motivation of people whose racial group is negatively characterized in academic settings. The first experiment had students believe that they might have a few friends in a field of study. White students were unaffected by this however, black students who were stigmatized academically displayed a drop in potential and sense of belonging. This response of minority students happens because they are aware that they are underrepresented and stigmatized therefore they perceive their worlds differently. Their second experiment was set up as an intervention that was designed to de-racialize the meaning of hardship in college by focusing hardships and doubts as a commonality among 1st year students rather than due to race. What their findings suggest is that majority students may benefit from an assumed sense of social belonging.<ref name = \"WaltonCohen\" />\n\n==Behavior/social problems==\nBelongingness, also referred to as connectedness, has been established as a strong risk/protective factor for depressive symptoms. There is growing evidence that the interpersonal factor of belongingness is strongly associated with depressive symptoms. The impression of low relational value is consciously experienced as reduced self-esteem. Reduced self-esteem is a fundamental element of depressive symptoms. According to these views, belongingness perceptions have a direct effect upon depressive symptoms due to innate neurological mechanisms. A number of studies have confirmed a strong link between belongingness and depressive symptoms using the Sense of Belonging Instrument-Psychological measurement. This measurement scale contains 14 items that invoke the social world\u2014for example, \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is any place I really fit in this world.\u201d The SOBI-P is intended to measure a general sense of belonging.<ref name = \"Cockshaw\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Cockshaw | first1 = W. | last2 = Shochet | first2 = I. | year = 2010 | title = The link between belongingness and depressive symptoms: An exploration in the workplace interpersonal context | url = | journal = Australian Psychologist | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 283\u2013289 | doi = 10.1080/00050061003752418 }}</ref>\n\nGroup membership has been found to have both negative and positive associations with behavior problems. Gender differences have been consistently observed in terms of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Girls reported more internalizing behaviors such as depression, and boys reported more externalizing problems. However, by providing a sense of security and peer acceptance, group membership may reduce the tendency to develop internalizing problems such as depression or anxiety. A lack of group membership is associated with behavior problems and puts adolescents at a greater risk for both externalizing and internalizing problems<ref name = \"Newman\" /> However, the need to belong may sometimes result in individuals conforming to delinquent peer groups and engaging in morally dubious activities, such as lying or cheating.<ref name=\"Baumeister\" />\n\n===Depression===\nHumans have a profound need to connect with others and gain acceptance into social groups. When relationships deteriorate or when social bonds are broken, people have been found to suffer from depressive symptoms.<ref name = \"Steger\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Steger | first1 = M.

Due to the importance of social experiences to people's well-being, and to [[etiology]] and maintenance of depression, it is vital to examine how depressed people's well-being is enhanced or eroded by positive and negative social interactions.\n\nWhen people experience positive social interactions, they should feel a sense of belonging. However, depressed people's social information-processing biases make them less likely to recognize cues of acceptance and belonging in social interactions. For example, in a laboratory study using information-processing tasks assessing attention and memory for sad, physically threatening, socially threatening, and positive stimuli, clinically depressed people were found to show preferential attention to sad faces, emotion words, and adjectives. Depressed people displayed biases for stimuli concerned with sadness and loss.<ref name = \"Gotlib\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Gotlib | first1 = I. H. | last2 = Kasch | first2 = K.

Those who are depressed appear to induce negative affect in other individuals, which consequently elicits rejection and the loss of socially rewarding opportunities. Depressed people are less likely to feel a sense of belonging and are more likely to pay attention to negative social interactions. Research has found that depressive symptoms may sensitize people to everyday experiences of both social rejection and social acceptance.<ref name = \"Steger\" />\n\n===Suicide===\nNumerous studies have indicated that low belonging, acquired ability to self-injure, and burdensomeness are associated with suicidal behaviors. A recent theoretical development: interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior, offers an explanation for the association between parental displacement and suicidal behavior. [[Thomas Joiner]], who recently proposed an interpersonal theory of [[suicide]], suggests that two elements must be present for suicidal behavior to occur. The first element is the [[desire]] for suicide and the second is the acquired capability for suicide. In turn, the desire for suicide, is broken into two components: thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Together these two components create a motivational force for suicidal behavior.<ref name = \"Joiner\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Joiner | first1 = T. E. Jr. | last2 = Pettit | first2 = J.

Increased acquired ability refers to a lack of pain response during self-injury, which has been found to be linked to the number of suicide attempts in a lifetime.<ref name = \"Timmons\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Timmons | first1 = K. A. | last2 = Selby | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Lewinsohn | first3 = P. M. | last4 = Joiner | first4 = T.

Parental relationships are a representation of belonging for adolescents because parents may be particularly important for providing the stable and caring relationships that are a fundamental component of belonging. Relationships between parents and adolescents that are positive have been found to be a [[protective factor]] that reduces the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Connectedness with parents such as closeness between parent and child and the perceived caring of parents, has been associated with lower levels of past suicide attempts and ideation. Another protective factor found against adolescent suicide attempts was higher levels of parental involvement.<ref name = \"Timmons\" />\n\nAccording to Baumeister and Leary, belongingness theory proposes that the desire for death is caused by failed interpersonal processes. Similar to Joiner, one is a thwarted sense of belonging due to an unmet need to belong and the other process being a sense that one is a burden on others. They argue that all individuals have a fundamental need to belong. This need to belong is only met if an individual has frequent, positive interactions with others and feels cared about by significant others.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" /> The concept of low belonging suggested by interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior is most relevant to parental displacement and adolescent suicidal behavior because it is likely that parental displacement would affect perceived belonging of adolescents. It was found that adolescents who averaged at about the age of 16, who experienced both low levels of belonging and displacement had the highest risk for suicide.<ref name = \"Timmons\" /> Parental displacement would disrupt the parent-adolescent relationship and consequently would diminish both the frequency and quality of interactions between the two, reducing the adolescent's sense of belonging.\n\nA study conducted on suicide notes, examined the frequency in themes of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in samples of suicide notes. The study of suicide notes has been a useful method for examining the motivations of suicides. It is important to note that this research is limited due to the small proportion of completed suicides that actually leave notes. This specific study explored the extent to which the content in the suicide notes reflected thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. They also examined the extent to which these two themes were found in the same note.  This study found that suicide notes did not significantly support the hypothesis that perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, combine with acquired capability to cause suicidal behavior. There was no strong support for the relevance of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness as motivations of suicide.  They did, however, find that the suicide notes of women more frequently contained the theme of perceived burdensomeness and suicide notes of younger people more frequently contained thwarted belongingness.<ref name = \"Gunn\" >Gunn, J., Lester, D., Haines, J., & Williams, C.

University Bielefeld - Center for InterAmerican Studies.\n\n[[Category:Interpersonal relationships]]\n", "text_old": "'''Belongingness''' is the human [[emotional]] [[need]] to be an accepted member of a [[group (sociology)|group]]. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, a religion, or something else, people tend to have an 'inherent' desire to belong and be an important part of something greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong is the need to give and receive attention to and from others.\n\nBelonging is a strong and inevitable feeling that exists in [[human nature]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} To belong or not to belong can occur due to choices of one's self, or the choices of others. Not everyone has the same life and interests, hence not everyone belongs to the same thing or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify themselves as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to their surroundings.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Roy Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary]] argue that belongingness is such a fundamental human [[motivation]] that we feel severe consequences of not belonging. If it wasn\u2019t so fundamental, then lack of belonging wouldn\u2019t have such dire consequences on us. This desire is so universal that the need to belong is found across all cultures and different types of people.<ref>Baumeister & Leary | need to belong, p. 499</ref>\n\n==Psychological needs==\n[[Abraham Maslow]] suggested that the need to belong was a major source of human motivation. He thought that it was one of 5 human needs in his [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], along with physiological needs, safety, [[self-esteem]], and [[self-actualization]]. These needs are arranged on a [[hierarchy]] and must be satisfied in order. After physiological and safety needs are met an individual can then work on meeting the need to belong and be loved. According to Maslow, if the first two needs are not met, then an individual cannot completely love someone else.\n\nOther theories have also focused on the need to belong as a fundamental psychological motivation. According to [[Roy Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary]], all human beings need a certain minimum quantity of regular, satisfying social interactions. Inability to meet this need results in [[loneliness]], [[mental distress]], and a strong desire to form new relationships.<ref name=\"Baumeister\">{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 497\u2013529 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497 | pmid = 7777651 }}</ref> Several psychologists have proposed that there are individual differences in people's motivation to belong. People with a strong motivation to belong are less satisfied with their relationships and tend to be relatively lonely.  As consumers, they tend to seek the opinions of others about products and services and also attempt to influence others' opinions.\n\nAccording to Baumeister and Leary, much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness. They argue that many of the human needs that have been documented, such as the needs for [[Need for power|power]], [[intimacy]], approval, [[Need for achievement|achievement]] and [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]], are all driven by the need to belong. Human culture is compelled and conditioned by pressure to belong. The need to belong and form [[Attachment theory|attachments]] is universal among humans. This counters the [[Freud]]ian argument that [[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality|sexuality]] and [[aggression]] are the major driving psychological forces. Those who believe that the need to belong is the major psychological drive also believe that humans are naturally driven toward establishing and sustaining relationships and belongingness. For example, interactions with strangers are possible first steps toward non-hostile and more long-term interactions with strangers that can satisfy the need for attachments. Certain people who are socially deprived can exhibit physical, behavioral, and psychological problems, such as stress or instability. These people are also more likely to show an increase in aiming to form new attachments.\n\n===Attachments===\nIn all [[culture]]s, attachments form universally. Social bonds are easily formed, without the need for favorable settings. The need to belong is a goal-directed activity that people try to satisfy with a certain minimum number of social contacts. The quality of interactions is more important than the quantity of interactions. People who form social attachments beyond that minimal amount experience less satisfaction from extra relationships, as well as more [[stress (psychological)|stress]] from terminating those extra relationships. People also effectively replace lost relationship partners by substituting them with new relationships or social environments. For example, individuals with strong family ties could compensate for loneliness at work.\n\nRelationships missing regular contact but characterized by strong feelings of commitment and intimacy also fail to satisfy the need. Just knowing that a [[Affectional bond|bond]] exists may be emotionally comforting, yet it would not provide a feeling of full belongingness if there is a lack of interaction between the persons. The belongingness hypothesis proposes two main features. First, people need constant, positive, personal interactions with other people. Second, people need to know that the bond is stable, there is mutual concern, and that this attachment will continue. So, the need to belong is not just a need for intimate attachments or a need for connections, but that the perception of the bond is as important as the bond itself. Individuals need to know that other people care about their [[well-being]] and love them.\n\nBaumeister and Leary argue that much of the research on group bonds can be interpreted through the lens of belongingness. They argue that plenty of evidence suggests that social bonds are formed easily. In the classic [[Robber's Cave study]], stranger boys were randomly grouped into two different groups and almost immediately, group identification and strong [[loyalty]] developed to their specific group. Initially, the two groups were asked to compete with one another, and hostility between the groups ensued. However, when the two groups were combined to form one big group and were given the opportunity to bond by working together to accomplish [[superordinate goals]], [[behaviors]] and [[emotions]] accommodated quickly to that new group. In an attempt to understand causes of [[in-group favoritism]], researchers formed{{Citation needed|reason=needs a reference, it is not mentioned in the Robber's Cave study article and its not clear whether it refers to that study or some other|date=April 2019}} a group so [[Minimal group paradigm|minimal]] and insignificant that one would expect that no favoritism would be found, yet in-group favoritism appeared immediately. Researchers agree that banding together against a threat (the [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]) and sharing rewards are primary reasons groups form and bond so easily. Mere [[The Proximity Principle|proximity]] is another powerful factor in relationship formation. Just like babies form attachments with their [[caregivers]], people develop attachments just because they live near one another. This suggests that proximity sometimes overcomes the tendencies to bond with others who are similar to us. Positive social bonds form just as easily under fearful circumstances, such as military veterans who have undergone heavy battle together. This can be explained by either [[Misattribution of arousal|misattribution]] (interpreting feelings of anxious arousal as feelings of attraction for another person) or [[reinforcement theory]] (the presence of another person reduces distress and elicits positive responses). Baumeister and Leary argue that the reinforcement theory explanation provides evidence for the importance of belonging needs because these learned associations create a tendency to seek out the company of others in times of threat. The formation of [[Attachment theory|social attachments]] with former rivals is a great indicator of the need to belong. Belonging motivations are so strong that they are able to overcome competitive feelings towards opponents.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople form such close attachments with one another that they are hesitant in breaking social bonds. Universally, people distress and protest ending social relationships across all cultures and age spans.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P. R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1\u201322 | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1 }}</ref> Even temporary groups, such as training groups, struggle with the idea that the group may eventually dissolve. The group may have fulfilled their purpose, but the participants want to cling on to the relationships and social bonds that have been formed with one another. The group members make promises individually and collectively to stay in touch, plan for future reunions, and take other steps to ensure the continuity of the attachment. For example, two people may not speak for an entire year, but continue exchanging holiday cards. People do not want to risk damaging a relationship or breaking an attachment, because it is distressing.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople are so hesitant in breaking social bonds that in many cases, they are hesitant to dissolve even bad relationships that could be potentially destructive. For example, many women are unwilling to leave their abusive spouses or boyfriends with excuses ranging from liking for the abuse to economic self-interests that are more important than physical harm.<ref>Roy, M. (Ed.). (1977). ''Batter women.'' New York: Van Nostrand.\n</ref> This unwillingness to leave an abusive partner, whether mentally or physically, is just another indicator of the power of the need to belong and how reluctant individuals are to break these bonds. Breaking off an attachment causes pain that is deeply rooted in the need to belong.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nPeople experience a range of both positive and negative emotions; the strongest emotions linked to attachment and belongingness. [[Empiricism|Empirical]] evidence suggests that when individuals are accepted, welcomed, or included it leads those individuals to feel positive emotions such as happiness, elation, calm, and satisfaction. However, when individuals are rejected or excluded, they feel strong negative emotions such as [[anxiety]], [[jealousy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and grief. In fact, the psychological pain caused by social rejection is so intense that it involves the same brain regions involved in the experience of physical pain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = MacDonald | first1 = G. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M. R. | year = 2005 | title = Why does social exclusion hurt? The relationship between social and physical pain | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 2| pages = 202\u2013223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.2.202 | pmid = 15740417 }}</ref> Both positive and negative reactions in emotion are connected to status of relationship. The existence of a social attachment changes the way one emotionally responds to the actions of a relationship partner and the emotions have the potential to intensify.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nLack of constant, positive relationships has been linked to a large range of consequences. People who lack belongingness are more prone to behavioral problems such as [[criminality]] and [[suicide]] and suffer from increasing mental and physical illness. Based on this evidence, multiple and diverse problems are caused by the lack of belongingness and attachments. It therefore seems appropriate to regard belongingness and attachments as a need rather than simply a want.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nRelationships that are centrally important in the way people think are [[interpersonal relationships]]. The belongingness hypothesis suggests that people devote much of their cognitive thought process to interpersonal relationships and attachments. For example, researchers found that people store information in terms of their [[Social Bonding Theory|social bonds]], such as storing more information about a marriage partner as opposed to a work acquaintance. People also sort out-group members on the basis of characteristics, traits, and duties, whereas they sort in-group members on person categories. Cognitive processing organizes information by the person they have a connection with as opposed to strangers. Researchers had a group of people take turns reading out-loud and they found that they had the greatest [[Recall (memory)|recall]] for the words they personally spoke, as well for words spoken by dating partners or close friends. There is a [[Cognition|cognitive]] merging of the self with specific people that is followed by the need to belong. Flattering words that are said to a spouse can enhance the self just as positively. People always believe that nothing bad can happen to themselves, and extend that thought to their family and friends.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nThere is an emotional implication to belongingness in which positive affect is linked to increases in belongingness while negative affect is linked to decreases in belongingness. Positive emotions are associated with forming social attachments, such as the experience of falling in [[love]], as long as the love is mutual. [[Unrequited love]] (love without belongingness) usually leads to disappointment whereas belongingness in love leads to joy.  Occasions such as childbirth, new employment, and fraternity/sorority pledging are all associated with the formation of new social attachments surrounded by positive emotions. Forming bonds is cause for joy, especially when the bond is given a permanent status, such as a wedding. Weddings signify permanent commitment and complete the social bond by committing to the spouse's need to belong. Positive experiences shared emotions increases attraction with others. Close personal attachments, a rich network of friends and high levels of intimacy motivation are all correlated to happiness in life.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nThe breaking of social bonds and threats to those bonds are primary sources of negative affect. People feel anxious, depressed, guilty or lonely when they lose important relationships. Social exclusion is the most common cause of anxiety. [[Anxiety]] is a natural consequence of being separated from others. Examples include children suffering from [[Separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]] from being separated from their mothers. Adults act similarly when their loved ones leave for a period of time. Memories of past rejection and imagining [[social rejection]] all elicit negative emotions. Losses of attachments lead directly to anxiety. If people are excluded from [[social groups]], people get anxious, yet the anxiety is removed when they experience social inclusion. Failing to feel accepted can lead to social and general depression. Depression and anxiety are significantly correlated. [[Social exclusion]] is also a major cause of jealousy, which is a common reaction when one's relationships are threatened. Jealousy is cross-culturally universal and in all cultures, sexual jealousy is common. It was said earlier that belongingness needs can only truly be met with [[Social network|social contact]], but social contact by itself does not shield people against loneliness. Loneliness matters more when there is a lack of intimacy as opposed to lack of contact. Another negative affect is guilt, which is caused to make the other person want to maintain the relationship more, such as paying more attention to that person.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\nDivorce and death are two negative events that spoil the need to belong. Divorce causes distress, anger, loneliness, and depression in almost everyone. The death of oneself and other people are the most traumatic and stressful events that people can experience. Death can cause severe depression, which is not a reaction to the loss of the loved one, but because there is a loss of the attachment with that other person. For example, a death of a spouse in which there was marriage problems can still elicit in extreme sadness at the loss of that attachment. Death is linked to anxiety and fear of loneliness. The idea of being separated from friends and family, and not the fact that they would no longer exist on this earth, is what brings about this anxiety.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" />\n\n==Evolutionary perspectives==\nOne reason for the need to belong is based on the theory of [[Evolutionary psychology|evolution]]. In the past belonging to a group was essential to survival: people hunted and cooked in [[Social group|groups]]. Belonging to a group allowed tribe members to share the workload and protect each other. Not only were they trying to ensure their own survival, but all members of their tribe were invested in each other's outcomes because each member played an important role in the group. More recently in Western society, this is not necessarily the case. Most people no longer belong to tribes, but they still protect those in their groups and still have a desire to belong in groups.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\">Fiske, S.T. (2004). ''Social beings: A core motives approach to social psychology.'' United States of America: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\"Baumeister\" />\n\nThe need to belong is rooted in evolutionary history. Human beings are social animals. Humans have matured over a long period of time in dyadic and group contexts.

This is known as ''[[self-presentation]]''.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\" /><ref><span class=\"citation book\">Schlenker, B. R. (1980).

In general, individuals seek out those who are most [[similarity (psychology)|similar]] to them.<ref>Berscheid, E., & Reis, H. T. (1998). Attraction and close relationships.  In D. T. Gilbert, S. T.

People also like those that they think they can understand and who they think can understand them.<ref name=\"Fiske, S.T. 2004\" />\n\n===Social connections===\nThe desire to form and maintain social bonds is among the most powerful human motives. If an individual's sense of social connectedness is threatened, their ability to self-regulate suffers. [[Social relationships]] are important for human functioning and [[well-being]] therefore, research on how social relationships affect people's personal interests and motivated behavior has been a focus of numerous studies. Walton, Cohen, and Spencer for example, believed that a mere sense of social connectedness (even with people who were unfamiliar) can cause one to [[internalize]] the goals and motivations of others. By doing so, this shapes people's motivated behavior suggesting achievement motivation and one's self-identity are highly sensitive to minor cues of social connection. Mere belonging is defined as an entryway to a social relationship, represented by a small cue of social connection to an individual or group. Social belonging is a sense of relatedness connected to a positive, lasting, and significant interpersonal relationship. While mere belonging is a minimal or even chance social connection, social belonging factors are characterized as social feedback, [[Social validation|validation]], and shared experiences. Sharing common goals and interests with others strengthens positive social bonds and may enhance feelings of self-worth.<ref name=\"Walton\">{{cite journal | last1 = Walton | first1 = G.

Their belonging uncertainty idea suggests that in academic and professional settings, members of socially stigmatized groups are more uncertain of the quality of their social bonds. Therefore, they feel more sensitive to issues of social belonging. They believe in domains of achievement, belonging uncertainty can have large effects on the motivation of those challenging with a threatened social identity.<ref name = \"WaltonCohen\">{{cite journal | last1 = Walton | first1 = G.

Conformity is the act of changing one's actions, attitudes, and behaviors to match the norms of others. Norms are unsaid rules that are shared by a group. The tendency to conform results from direct and indirect social pressures occurring in whole societies and in small groups. There are two types of conformity motivations known as [[informational social influence]] and [[normative social influence]]. Information social influence is the desire to obtain and form accurate information about reality. Information social influence occurs in certain situations, such as in a crisis.  This information can be sought out by other people in the group or experts. If someone is in a situation where they do not know the right way to behave, they look at the cues of others to correct their own behavior. These people conform because the group interpretation is more accurate than your own.  Normative social influence is the desire to obtain social approval from others. Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be accepted by members of a group, since the need to belong is in our human desire. When people do not conform, they are less liked by the group and may even be considered deviant. Normative influence usually leads to public compliance, which is fulfilling a request or doing something that one may not necessarily believe in, but that the group believes in.<ref name=\"Cialdini\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = N.

Individuals are more likely to conform to groups who describe out-group members with [[stereotype]] traits, even though don\u2019t publicly express their agreement. People desire to gain approval so they conform to others. The beliefs held by others and how we react to those beliefs is often reliant on our view of the amount of agreement for those beliefs. Researchers are interested in exploring informational and normative motivational influences to conform on [[majorities]] and minorities. Objective consensus theory suggests that majority influence of a group is informational, while [[Conversion theory of minority influence|conversion theory]] views it as normative. Normative influences may be the underlying motivations behind certain types of conformity; however, researchers believe that after time, informational influences such as confidence in the accuracy of one's intergroup norms is positively correlated with distinguished level of compromise.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" />\n\nOutside the conscious mind, a type of conformity is behavioral mimicry, otherwise known as the chameleon effect. Behavioral mimicry is when individuals mimic behaviors such as [[facial expressions]], [[Posture (psychology)|postures]], and mannerisms between other individuals. Researchers found that individuals [[subconscious]]ly conformed to the mannerisms of their partners and friends and liked these partners more who mirrored them. This is important in regard to [[rapport]] building and forming new social relationships-we mirror the behaviors we are supposed to, to get to where we want to belong in the group. People are motivated to conform to gain social approval and enhance and protect their own self-esteems. However, people who wish to combat conformity and fight that need to belong with the majority group can do so by focusing on their own [[self-worth]] or by straying from the attitudes and norms of others{{clarify|date=December 2018}}. This can establish a sense of uniqueness within an individual. Yet, most individuals keep positive assessments of themselves and still conform to valued groups.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" />\n\n===Self-regulation===\nWhen our belongingness needs are not met, Wilkowski and colleagues (2009) suggest that self-regulation is used to fulfill one's need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkowski | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = M. D. | last3 = Frieson | first3 = C. K. | year = 2009 | title = Gaze-triggered orienting as a tool of the belongingness self-regulation system | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 495\u2013501 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02321.x | pmid = 19399981 }}</ref> Self-regulation is defined as the process of regulating oneself, or changing one's behavior, to manage short-term desires according to the [[self-regulation theory]]. Self-regulation can occur in many different ways. One of these ways uses other individual's gaze(s) as a reference to understand how attention should be divided. This effect is especially seen within individuals that have low levels of self-esteem. Interpersonal acceptance is not met in individuals with low self-esteem, which prompts them to self-regulate by looking to others for guidance with regards to where to focus attention. Belongingness contributes to this level of self-esteem. Baumeister, Dewall, Ciarocco, and Twenge (2005) found that when people are socially excluded from a group, self-regulation is less likely to be than those who have a heightened sense of belonging.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = DeWall | first2 = C. N. | last3 = Ciarocco | first3 = N. J. | last4 = Twenge | first4 = J.

Later, those participants were offered a plate of cookies. The participants that were told that nobody in the group wanted to work with them took more cookies than those who were not told this information, which provides evidence that a lack of belongingness inhibits people's ability to self-regulate. Self-regulation includes impulse control and allows one to manage short-term impulses and have a heightened sense of belongingness within an [[ingroup]]. An ingroup is a social group in which a person psychologically defines themselves as being a member of that specific group. By being a part of this group, one has a better ability to self-regulate.\n\n===Peer networks===\nAs the span of relationships expands from childhood into adolescence, a sense of peer group membership is likely to develop. Adolescent girls have been found to value group membership more and are more identified with their peer groups than boys. Adolescent girls tend to have a higher number of friends than boys. They expect and desire more nurturing behavior from their friends. Girls experience more self-disclosure, more empathy, and less overt hostility compared to boys. A study found that girls use ruminative coping, which involves perseverating on the negative feelings and the unpleasant situations associated with problems. Boys on the other hand, tend to be less intimate and have more activity based friendships. Boys do not benefit as much as girls from feelings of belonging that are a product of enduring and close friendships. They are less vulnerable to the emotional distress that is likely to accompany high levels of co-rumination and disclosure.<ref name = \"Newman\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = B.

For example, allowing the individual to become part of the group or by paying more attention to the individual is a [[positive reinforcement]]. This is a source of motivation for the individual to repeat the activity or engage in other approved activities. Adolescents have also been observed to choose friendships with individuals who engage in similar activities to those that they are involved in. This provides the individual with more opportunities to engage in the activity therefore the peer group may influence how often the individual engages in the activity. To feel a sense of belonging and fit in, adolescents often conform to activities of a particular group by participating in the same activities as members of the peer group.<ref name=\"Bauman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bauman | first1 = K.

To capture an adolescent's self-perception of group affiliation one may ask an adolescent to identify themselves as a member of a group or discuss whether they belong in a group. An affective aspect of group belongingness includes feelings of being proud of one's group and being a valued group member. The affective nature of a sense of group belonging has been found to be the most internally consistent. It is important to find out how important it is for an adolescent to be a member of a group because not all adolescents are equally concerned about being part of a group. Those who strongly desire to be in a peer group and do not experience a sense of group belonging are expected to have the greatest social distress and are likely to report the most behavior problems.<ref name = \"Newman\" />\n\n===Schooling===\nA sense of belonging to a social peer group can enhance students academic achievement.<ref>Anderman, L.

At a college level, a better sense of belonging has been linked to perceived professor caring and greater involvement in campus organizations. In a study exploring associations between a sense of school belonging and academic and psychological adjustment, Pittman and Richmond found that college students who reported a greater sense of belonging at a college level, were doing better academically and felt more competent scholastically but also had a higher self-worth and lower levels of externalizing problems. However, students who were having problems with their relationships with friends, were found to experience more internalizing behaviors and feel less connected to the college.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pittman | first1 = L.

Furthermore, school connectedness involves a student having a sense of safety at school as well as positive student-teacher relationships.\n\nDespite the slight differences in meaning, these terms commonly include three aspects: they refer to school-based relationships and experiences,  they involve the relationship between students and teachers, and they include a student's general feelings about school as a whole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA large number of variables have been found to be significantly associated with school belonging.

However, school belonging is slightly different. Schools can help students to develop a sense of belonging because they are in a position to develop social networks. School belonging is affected by the school\u2019s social and organisational culture.\n\nThe fact that school belonging, by its very nature, is affected by the wider environment, it is consistent with Bronfenbrenner\u2019s <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hardcastle|first=Beverly|last2=Byrnes|first2=Deborah|last3=Bartlett|first3=Andrea|last4=Denton|first4=Penelope|last5=Walsh|first5=Patrick R.|date=May 1981|title=The Ecology of Human Development\u2014Experiments by Nature and Designby Urie Bronfenbrenner.

These frameworks put forward the theory that children\u2019s development takes place within the systems in society, and that these systems interact. Every child is at the center of multiple levels of influence. It has been argued that a social-ecological lens is the most adequate lens with which to view the construct of school belonging, given the large number of variables at play, and also the unique nature of school belonging for both the individual and the school.\n\nAt school, students are a part of a greater whole influenced by both formal and informal groupings, and overarching systems that are common and typically represented within all schools. Thus, school belonging can be conceptualized as a multi-layered, socio-ecological phenomena, consisting of several interacting layers. This is depicted in the figure.\n\n[[File:School Belongings.png|thumb]]\n\nThe innermost layer of the construct is the individual level. This describes the unique student characteristics that contribute to the sense of belonging, including personality and mental health. The micro-system refers to network an individual has that are informal, such as family, friends, teachers, and peers with whom the student interacts with. The mesosystem refers to organisational factors, including school resources, processes, policies, rules and practices. The exosystem refers to the broader school community. Finally, the macro-system involves the legislation, history and social climate of a society. This socio-ecological framework has been developed from empirical studies, and provides schools with a thorough direction in which to foster school belonging\n\nGiven that school belonging is largely about perception, social belonging interventions such as those suggested by Walton and Brady <ref>{{Citation|chapter=Barriers, Possibilities, and How Sociology Can Help|pages=25\u201348|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781412978101|doi=10.4135/9781483387314.n2|title=How Can We Solve Our Social Problems?|year=2011}}</ref> have therefore been found to be useful. They argue that these interventions provide students with an adaptive lens with which to make sense of adversities in school. For minority students, challenges at school can give rise to feelings of non-belonging.\n\nOne such social intervention described by Walton and Brady sees stories used, whereby difficulties at school are portrayed as a normal part of education. Rather than attributing challenges as a sign that one doesn\u2019t belong, the stories acknowledge group-based difficulties, but show how these experiences are not necessarily a barrier to ultimately belonging and succeeding.\n\nOne group that may have the feelings of non-belonging that challenges can lead to, is those of a racial minority. The students who are from minority groups may attribute challenges \u2013 both academic and otherwise \u2013 to their racial identity. Social support is essential for improving belonging, most especially for students from minority backgrounds for whom acceptance by peers, teachers and parents is an important behavior of pro-social behavior and a positive attitude towards school.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galliher|first=Renee Vickerman|last2=Rostosky|first2=Sharon Scales|last3=Hughes|first3=Hannah K.|date=June 2004|title=School Belonging, Self-Esteem, and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents: An Examination of Sex, Sexual Attraction Status, and Urbanicity|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=33|issue=3|pages=235\u2013245|doi=10.1023/b:joyo.0000025322.11510.9d|issn=0047-2891}}</ref>\n\n===Workplace===\nThe need to belong is especially evident in the workplace. Employees want to fit in at work as much as students want to fit in at school. They seek the approval and acceptance of leaders, bosses, and other employees. [[Charismatic authority|Charismatic leaders]] are especially known to show off [[organizational citizenship behavior]]s such as helping and compliance if they feel a sense of belongingness with their work group. Researchers found that charisma and belongingness increased cooperative behavior among employees. Charismatic leaders influence followers by bringing awareness to the collective unit and strengthening the feeling of belonging, and that enhances employees\u2019 compliance. [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s are employee activities that benefit the collective group without the individual gaining any direct benefit. Helping is a huge component of organizational citizenship behaviors because helping involves voluntarily assisting others with problems that are work-related and preventing other issues from arising. Task performance is enhanced and supported when the acts of helping in a work environment are established and evident. Charismatic leaders set a striking example for the way to organization should behave by reinforcing certain rules and values for the organization. These self-confident leaders inspire their followers to exceed expectations for the collective group instead of their own self-interest. This in turn gives employees an identity with which to belong.<ref name=\"Den Hartog\">{{cite journal | last1 = Den Hartog | first1 = D. N. | last2 = De Hoogh | first2 = A.

Belongingness and group membership encourages social groups with motivation to comply, cooperate, and help. [[Group cohesiveness|Cohesive]] work groups show more consideration, report positive relationships within the group and elicits more organizational citizenship behaviors. Also, an already cohesive and collective group makes people more inclined to comply with the rules of the workplace. Some people help each other in return for a future expected favor; however, most workings help because it is the \u201cright\u201d thing to do or because they like their leaders so much and wish to express this likeness. People are more receptive to a leader who provides a clear sense of direction and inspiration with the promise of a better future. Workers who feel more isolated in the workplace feel the need to belong even more than those who are not isolated because they are missing that collective feeling of unity. A workplace functions better as a collective whole.<ref name = \"Den Hartog\" />\n\n==Acceptance/rejection==\nThe need to belong is among the most fundamental of all personality processes. Given the negative consequences of [[social rejection]], people developed traits that function to encourage acceptance and to prevent rejection. But if the need to belong evolved to provide people with a means of meeting their basic needs for survival and reproduction based on evolutionary experiences, thwarting the need to belong should affect a variety of outcomes. Because it strikes at the core of human functioning, people respond very strongly to social exclusion.<ref name=\"Dewall\">{{cite journal | last1 = DeWall | first1 = C. | last2 = Deckman | first2 = T. | last3 = Pond | first3 = R.

Feeling disliked, excluded, unappreciated, or devalued can stir up negative emotions in an individual. Some of these negative emotions include a lower self-esteem, [[Aggression|aggressive]] actions and [[antisocial behavior]]. However, believing you are liked, included, appreciated, or valued elicits feelings of higher self-esteem and confidence boosts. A different number of events can lead individuals to feel accepted versus rejected. We can simply see the power of interpersonal acceptance and rejection when accepted vs. ostracized by a group, adored vs. abandoned by a romantic partner, or elected vs. defeated in an election.<ref name = \"Buckley\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Buckley | first1 = K.

Perceived relational evaluation is the degree to which you perceive others value having a relationship with you. You feel more accepted if another person or group regards your relationship with them as real and as important to them as it is to you. If they consider the relationship unimportant, you feel rejected and respond negatively.<ref name = \"Buckley\" />\n\nIn a series of experiments, Buckley, Winkel, and [[Mark Leary|Leary]] found that the effects of rejection are more potent than the effects of acceptance because negative feelings can cause more feelings of hurt and pain, which in turn can lead to aggression and negative behaviors. They also found people's reactions to extreme and moderate rejection were similar, suggesting that once one has been rejected by an individual or group, the severity of the rejection is less important<ref name = \"Buckley\" />\n\n===Procedural justice===\nProcedural justice, in terms of belongingness, according to van Prooijen and colleagues (2004), is the process by which people judge their level of belongingness in terms of their ability to contribute to a group.<ref name=\"Prooijen, J. W. 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = van Prooijen | first1 = J. W. | last2 = van den Bos | first2 = K. | last3 = Wilke | first3 = H. A. | year = 2004 | title = Group belongingness and procedural justice: social inclusion and exclusion by peers affects the psychology of voice | url = http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/17298/VanProoijen%20Journal%20of%20Personality%20and%20Social%20Psychology%2087%202004%20u.pdf?sequence=2 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 66\u201379 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.66 | pmid = 15250793 }}</ref> Members of a highly inclusive group show a higher level of procedural justice, meaning that individuals that experience high levels of inclusion respond in a more extreme manner to decisions allocated by members of their ingroup than those that are handed down from members of an [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]. In other words, a person is more likely to believe and support fairness decisions made by members of an ingroup in which they feel like they are a part of, compared to an ingroup in which they do not feel as strongly connected. De Cremer and Blader (2006) found that when people feel a heightened sense of belongingness, they process information about procedural justice in a more careful and systematic way.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = De Cremer | first1 = D. | last2 = Blader | first2 = S. L. | year = 2006 | title = Why do people care about procedural fairness? The importance of belongingness in responding and attending to procedures | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 211\u2013228 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.290 }}</ref> This means that when people feel like they belong, they are more likely to examine procedural justice issues in a more thorough manner than if they do not feel like they belong.\n\n===Fairness===\nFairness principles are applied when belongingness needs are met. Van Prooojen and colleagues (2004) found that fairness maintains an individual's sense of inclusion in social groups.<ref name=\"Prooijen, J. W. 2004\"/> Fairness can be used as an inclusion maintenance tool. Relationships are highly valued within groups, so members of those groups seek out fairness cues so they can understand these relationships. De Cremer and colleagues (2013) suggest that individuals with a high need to belong care more about procedural fairness information and therefore pay closer attention to incoming information. Furthermore, Cornelis, Van Hiel, De Cremer and Mayer (2013) propose that leaders of a group are likely to be more fair when they are aware that the followers of the group have a high need to belong versus a low need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cornelis | first1 = I. | last2 = Van Hiel | first2 = A. | last3 = De Cremer | first3 = D. | last4 = Mayer | first4 = D. M. | year = 2013 | title = When leaders choose to be fair: Follower belongingness needs and leader empathy influences leaders' adherence to procedural fairness rules | url = https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4414669/file/4424619 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 605\u2013613 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.016 | hdl = 1854/LU-4414669 }}</ref> This means that a leader who is aware that people in their group are motivated to adhere to group values is more fair. Leaders are also more fair in congruence with the amount of empathy they feel for followers. Empathetic leaders are more likely to pay attention to differences among followers, and to consider a follower's belongingness needs when making decisions. In addition, Cornelis, Van Hiel, & De Cremer (2012) discovered that leaders are more fair in granting their followers voice when the leader is aware that the follower has a high need to belong.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cornelis | first1 = I. | last2 = Van Hiel | first2 = A. | last3 = De Cremer | first3 = D. | year = 2012 | title = The effect of followers' belongingness needs on leaders' procedural fairness enactment: Mediation through interpersonal and team attraction | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201339 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000053 }}</ref> This occurs because of the attraction a leader feels to the follower and to the group. Leaders that are attracted to their followers and to the group are motivated by the follower's need to belong to allow them a greater voice in the group.\n\n==Culture==\nIn all cultures, the need to belong is prevalent. Although there are individual differences in the intensity and strength of how people express and satisfy the need, it is really difficult for culture to eradicate the need to belong.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" /> Collectivist countries are also more likely to conform and comply with the majority group than members in [[Individualistic culture|individualistic]] societies. Conformity is so important in collectivist societies that nonconformity can represent deviance in [[Mediterranean culture|Circum-Mediterranean cultures]], yet represent uniqueness in [[Sinosphere]] culture.<ref name = \"Cialdini\" /> Even early civilizations considered both exile and death as equal punishments. Individuals in other countries strive to belong so much that being exiled or shunned from their society is the biggest dishonor.<ref name = \"Dewall\" />\n\nMotivation to belong varies throughout different cultures, and can effect student achievement in distinct ways. In studies comparing fifteen year old students from 31 countries, the differences between Eastern and Western cultures were apparent. It is important to note that the study is in the perspective of dividing these countries into two groups. The study argues that Asian (eastern) cultures are collectivist, while Western cultures are more individualistic. In Western cultures, peer influence is more predominant while in Eastern cultures, they are more heavily influenced by their families. In a classroom setting, children from Eastern cultures are more competitive, giving them less of a drive to belong among their peers. These children have a great sense of motivation to excel and to do better than those around them which makes their needs for belongingness in a school setting less favorable. While in Western cultures, being so highly impacted by their peers, it gives them less of a drive to be competitive towards them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cortina|first=Kai S.|last2=Arel|first2=Sari|last3=Smith-Darden|first3=Joanne P.|date=2017|title=School Belonging in Different Cultures: The Effects of Individualism and Power Distance|journal=Frontiers in Education|language=English|volume=2|doi=10.3389/feduc.2017.00056|issn=2504-284X|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/147229/1/Cortina%2c%20Arel%2c%20Smith-Darden%202017.pdf}}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that Eastern and Western cultures continue to have one of the largest achievement gaps between them, with Eastern cultures outscoring the Western.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=39a686e4-b674-414a-a908-7d2efb16d2e8@sdc-v-sessmgr04|title=User Verification {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref> It can be hypothesized that the competitive, individualistic drive found in the classroom in Eastern cultures leads to more success. Furthermore, belongingness in Western cultures may have the potential to inhibit classroom success. However, it is very important to note that not all cultures respond to belongingness in the same way due to the many variations between cultures.\n\nFurthermore, stigmas can create a global uncertainty about the quality of an individual's social bonds in academically and professional areas. Walton and Cohen conducted two experiments that tested how belonging uncertainty undermines the achievement and motivation of people whose racial group is negatively characterized in academic settings. The first experiment had students believe that they might have a few friends in a field of study. White students were unaffected by this however, black students who were stigmatized academically displayed a drop in potential and sense of belonging. This response of minority students happens because they are aware that they are underrepresented and stigmatized therefore they perceive their worlds differently. Their second experiment was set up as an intervention that was designed to de-racialize the meaning of hardship in college by focusing hardships and doubts as a commonality among 1st year students rather than due to race. What their findings suggest is that majority students may benefit from an assumed sense of social belonging.<ref name = \"WaltonCohen\" />\n\n==Behavior/social problems==\nBelongingness, also referred to as connectedness, has been established as a strong risk/protective factor for depressive symptoms. There is growing evidence that the interpersonal factor of belongingness is strongly associated with depressive symptoms. The impression of low relational value is consciously experienced as reduced self-esteem. Reduced self-esteem is a fundamental element of depressive symptoms. According to these views, belongingness perceptions have a direct effect upon depressive symptoms due to innate neurological mechanisms. A number of studies have confirmed a strong link between belongingness and depressive symptoms using the Sense of Belonging Instrument-Psychological measurement. This measurement scale contains 14 items that invoke the social world\u2014for example, \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is any place I really fit in this world.\u201d The SOBI-P is intended to measure a general sense of belonging.<ref name = \"Cockshaw\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Cockshaw | first1 = W. | last2 = Shochet | first2 = I. | year = 2010 | title = The link between belongingness and depressive symptoms: An exploration in the workplace interpersonal context | url = | journal = Australian Psychologist | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 283\u2013289 | doi = 10.1080/00050061003752418 }}</ref>\n\nGroup membership has been found to have both negative and positive associations with behavior problems. Gender differences have been consistently observed in terms of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Girls reported more internalizing behaviors such as depression, and boys reported more externalizing problems. However, by providing a sense of security and peer acceptance, group membership may reduce the tendency to develop internalizing problems such as depression or anxiety. A lack of group membership is associated with behavior problems and puts adolescents at a greater risk for both externalizing and internalizing problems<ref name = \"Newman\" /> However, the need to belong may sometimes result in individuals conforming to delinquent peer groups and engaging in morally dubious activities, such as lying or cheating.<ref name=\"Baumeister\" />\n\n===Depression===\nHumans have a profound need to connect with others and gain acceptance into social groups. When relationships deteriorate or when social bonds are broken, people have been found to suffer from depressive symptoms.<ref name = \"Steger\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Steger | first1 = M.

Due to the importance of social experiences to people's well-being, and to [[etiology]] and maintenance of depression, it is vital to examine how depressed people's well-being is enhanced or eroded by positive and negative social interactions.\n\nWhen people experience positive social interactions, they should feel a sense of belonging. However, depressed people's social information-processing biases make them less likely to recognize cues of acceptance and belonging in social interactions. For example, in a laboratory study using information-processing tasks assessing attention and memory for sad, physically threatening, socially threatening, and positive stimuli, clinically depressed people were found to show preferential attention to sad faces, emotion words, and adjectives. Depressed people displayed biases for stimuli concerned with sadness and loss.<ref name = \"Gotlib\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Gotlib | first1 = I. H. | last2 = Kasch | first2 = K.

Those who are depressed appear to induce negative affect in other individuals, which consequently elicits rejection and the loss of socially rewarding opportunities. Depressed people are less likely to feel a sense of belonging and are more likely to pay attention to negative social interactions. Research has found that depressive symptoms may sensitize people to everyday experiences of both social rejection and social acceptance.<ref name = \"Steger\" />\n\n===Suicide===\nNumerous studies have indicated that low belonging, acquired ability to self-injure, and burdensomeness are associated with suicidal behaviors. A recent theoretical development: interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior, offers an explanation for the association between parental displacement and suicidal behavior. [[Thomas Joiner]], who recently proposed an interpersonal theory of [[suicide]], suggests that two elements must be present for suicidal behavior to occur. The first element is the [[desire]] for suicide and the second is the acquired capability for suicide. In turn, the desire for suicide, is broken into two components: thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Together these two components create a motivational force for suicidal behavior.<ref name = \"Joiner\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Joiner | first1 = T. E. Jr. | last2 = Pettit | first2 = J.

Increased acquired ability refers to a lack of pain response during self-injury, which has been found to be linked to the number of suicide attempts in a lifetime.<ref name = \"Timmons\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Timmons | first1 = K.

Parental relationships are a representation of belonging for adolescents because parents may be particularly important for providing the stable and caring relationships that are a fundamental component of belonging. Relationships between parents and adolescents that are positive have been found to be a [[protective factor]] that reduces the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Connectedness with parents such as closeness between parent and child and the perceived caring of parents, has been associated with lower levels of past suicide attempts and ideation. Another protective factor found against adolescent suicide attempts was higher levels of parental involvement.<ref name = \"Timmons\" />\n\nAccording to Baumeister and Leary, belongingness theory proposes that the desire for death is caused by failed interpersonal processes. Similar to Joiner, one is a thwarted sense of belonging due to an unmet need to belong and the other process being a sense that one is a burden on others. They argue that all individuals have a fundamental need to belong. This need to belong is only met if an individual has frequent, positive interactions with others and feels cared about by significant others.<ref name = \"Baumeister\" /> The concept of low belonging suggested by interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior is most relevant to parental displacement and adolescent suicidal behavior because it is likely that parental displacement would affect perceived belonging of adolescents. It was found that adolescents who averaged at about the age of 16, who experienced both low levels of belonging and displacement had the highest risk for suicide.<ref name = \"Timmons\" /> Parental displacement would disrupt the parent-adolescent relationship and consequently would diminish both the frequency and quality of interactions between the two, reducing the adolescent's sense of belonging.\n\nA study conducted on suicide notes, examined the frequency in themes of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in samples of suicide notes. The study of suicide notes has been a useful method for examining the motivations of suicides. It is important to note that this research is limited due to the small proportion of completed suicides that actually leave notes. This specific study explored the extent to which the content in the suicide notes reflected thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. They also examined the extent to which these two themes were found in the same note.  This study found that suicide notes did not significantly support the hypothesis that perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, combine with acquired capability to cause suicidal behavior. There was no strong support for the relevance of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness as motivations of suicide.  They did, however, find that the suicide notes of women more frequently contained the theme of perceived burdensomeness and suicide notes of younger people more frequently contained thwarted belongingness.<ref name = \"Gunn\" >Gunn, J., Lester, D., Haines, J., & Williams, C.

These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at \u201cobligatory passage points\u201d which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.\n\nTo give a sense of how this model works, Clegg applies it to Crozier's<ref>Crozier, M. 1964, The bureaucratic phenomenon, Tavistock, London, UK.</ref> study of a tobacco factory in France where maintenance workers modified the plant equipment. This action empowered them with exclusive knowledge of the machinery unavailable in the manuals. It also represented taking control of an obligatory passage point, which altered all three circuits of power. The act directly altered the facilitative circuit of technology. The knock-on effect at the dispositional circuit was that it changed what it meant to be a maintenance worker. At the episodic circuit it altered the worker's power in day-to-day interaction and control of resources and outcomes. The overall impact of taking control of an obligatory passage point was that it allowed the workers to negotiate increased freedoms and wage increases.\n\n==Academic positions==\n\nBefore moving to UTS, Clegg was reader at [[Griffith University]] (1976\u201384), professor at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (1985\u201389), professor at the [[University of St. Andrews]] (1990\u20131993), and foundation professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Macarthur, New South Wales|Macarthur]], (1993\u201396).

Creating and capitalizing on the best new management thinking, [[Harvard Business School]], Boston, MA.</ref> and this book has been translated into many languages, including Spanish, [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French. He sits on Editorial Boards for research journals and is editor of the AiOS (Advances in Organization Studies) for [[Benjamins]], the European and American publishers. Stewart has also acted as consultant to international newspapers, such as the ''[[British Sunday Times]]'' and the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'', for whom he has devised the methodology for their \"Power Lists\", as well as to universities, business firms, and health services.<ref name=\"saxton1\">[http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=2580 Stewart Clegg \u2013 Saxton Speakers Bureau]</ref>\n\n==Theory of power==\n\nClegg's \"circuits of power\"<ref>Clegg, S.R. 1989, Frameworks of power, Sage, London, UK.</ref> theory likens the production and organising of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at \u201cobligatory passage points\u201d which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.\n\nTo give a sense of how this model works, Clegg applies it to Crozier's<ref>Crozier, M. 1964, The bureaucratic phenomenon, Tavistock, London, UK.</ref> study of a tobacco factory in France where maintenance workers modified the plant equipment. This action empowered them with exclusive knowledge of the machinery unavailable in the manuals. It also represented taking control of an obligatory passage point, which altered all three circuits of power. The act directly altered the facilitative circuit of technology. The knock-on effect at the dispositional circuit was that it changed what it meant to be a maintenance worker. At the episodic circuit it altered the worker's power in day-to-day interaction and control of resources and outcomes. The overall impact of taking control of an obligatory passage point was that it allowed the workers to negotiate increased freedoms and wage increases.\n\n==Academic positions==\n\nBefore moving to UTS, Clegg was reader at [[Griffith University]] (1976\u201384), professor at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (1985\u201389), professor at the [[University of St. Andrews]] (1990\u20131993), and foundation professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Macarthur, New South Wales|Macarthur]], (1993\u201396). He has also held positions at universities in Scotland; Australia, England, France, [[New Zealand]], Hong Kong, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Mexico]] and the United States.<ref name=\"saxton1\"/> He currently also holds visiting professorships at European universities and research centres. In 2010 he spent time as a visiting distinguished fellow in the Institute of Advanced Study, [[Durham University]], and in 2011 will be the Montezelomo Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Judge Institute]].\n\n==Honorary Doctor of Philosophy==\nStewart is one of the 2017 honorary doctor recipients at [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. The honorary doctorate was awarded for his scientific output which has far-reaching multidisciplinary content characterized by the ambition to place organization and management theory in a wider social science context all the while setting out from a critical and reflecting view. His research contribution on power mechanisms in organizations is indisputable. Stewart R. Clegg also held an active role as a member of the scientific reference group in the research project funded by the Swedish Riksbank Strategy, Design and Organizing in City Development Processes (Led by Nils W\u00e5hlin at Ume\u00e5 School of Business and Economics), that greatly dealt with the European Capital of Culture venture in Ume\u00e5.

It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].\n\n[[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years.

According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *\"Bass-an-as\"), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \"bos\" or \"bogh\"\u2014meaning \"the running water\".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia \"adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]\".<ref>{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA464|date=1921}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Herzegovina'' (\"herzog's [land]\", from German word for \"duke\"){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]]'s title, \"Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast\" (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''The World Factbook'' (Washington DC: National Foreign Assessment Center, Central Intelligence Agency, 2013), 90-93. {{ISBN|0160921953}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[\u010capljina]]]]\n{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the [[Paleolithic]], as one of the oldest paint caving was found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. Major Neolithic cultures such as the [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] and [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]] were present along the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] dated from c. 6230 BC \u2013 c. 4900 BC.\n\n=== Ancient Illyrians ===\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\n\nFrom 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by [[Daesitiates]] tribe most commonly associated with [[Central Bosnian cultural group]]. Iron Age [[Glasinac culture]] is associated with [[Autariatae]] tribe.\n\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]]. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17</ref> This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.<ref>Miller, Norma.

By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.

It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton Accords]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.\n\nThe [[Br\u010dko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Br\u010dko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Br\u010dko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.<ref name=\"OHR\">OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBesides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four \"official\" cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Isto\u010dno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).\n\nAs a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.\n\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHowever, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of \"Democracy\" without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref> International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.\n\n===Military===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.\n\nThe Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with ISAF peace missions to Afghanistan, [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in Afghanistan. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in Iraq, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.\n\nThe Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The Air Force has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country. The Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|newspaper=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064503/https://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|archive-date=2 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{main|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}\n[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007.

Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT) building, Sarajevo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] headquarter in [[Sarajevo]].]]\n\nSome television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are state-owned, and some are for-profit corporations funded by [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].\n\nAs a [[country in transition]] with a post-war legacy and a [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|complex domestic political structure]] Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995\u20132005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.<ref>Hozi\u0107, 2008; Thompson & De Luce, 2002; Kurspahi\u0107, 2003; Jusi\u0107, 2006</ref><ref name=\"EJC\">Tarik Jusi\u0107, \"[http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina |date=4 March 2016 }}\", EJC Media Landscapes</ref>\n\nPost-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.\nYet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andri\u0107]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko \u0160imi\u0107]], [[Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107]], [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinovi\u0107]], [[Miljenko Jergovi\u0107]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Ba\u0161agi\u0107]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Ko\u010di\u0107]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Ned\u017ead Ibri\u0161imovi\u0107. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107]].\nMagazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.\n\n===Art===\n{{main|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Ste\u0107ci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]\n\nThe art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Ste\u0107ci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromani\u0107|Kotromani\u0107]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurki\u0107]], [[Petar \u0160ain]], [[Roman Petrovi\u0107]] and [[Lazar Drlja\u010da]].\n\nAfter World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.\n\nIn 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}\n\nTypical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zoni\u0107]], [[Goran Bregovi\u0107]], [[Davorin Popovi\u0107]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]], [[Elvir Lakovi\u0107]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[\u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris D\u017einovi\u0107]], [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Du\u0161an \u0160esti\u0107]], the creator of the [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija \u0160esti\u0107]], to the world known jazz musician, educator and Bosnian jazz ambassador [[Sinan Alimanovi\u0107]], composer [[Sa\u0161a Lo\u0161i\u0107]] and pianist [[Sa\u0161a Toperi\u0107]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.\n\nProbably the most distinctive and identifiably \"Bosnian\" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.\n\n{{main|Bosnian root music}}\nRural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and \"ravne pjesme\" (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[\u0161argija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.\n[[File:43. TKB - Seljo z Sarajewa (Bo\u015bnia i Hercegowina) 10.JPG|thumb|Bosnians dancing a traditional [[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]]]\n\n''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|\u0161argija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Ba\u011flama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it's maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.\n\nStudio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from [[\u017divinice]] together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[\u017divinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.\n\n===Cinema and theatre===\n{{main|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}\n\nSarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.\n\nBosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Awards]] to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian screenwriters, directors and producers are [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]] (known for the Academy Award\u2013 and [[Golden Globe Award]]\u2013winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]\u2013winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards & Juries: International Jury \"Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816162458/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Ademir Kenovi\u0107]], Dino Mustafi\u0107, [[Ahmed Imamovi\u0107]], [[Pjer \u017dalica]], [[Aida Begi\u0107]], Adis Bakra\u010d, etc.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}\n[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]\nBosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]].

It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].\n\n[[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years.

According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *\"Bass-an-as\"), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \"bos\" or \"bogh\"\u2014meaning \"the running water\".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia \"adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]\".<ref>{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA464|date=1921}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Herzegovina'' (\"herzog's [land]\", from German word for \"duke\"){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]]'s title, \"Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast\" (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''The World Factbook'' (Washington DC: National Foreign Assessment Center, Central Intelligence Agency, 2013), 90-93. {{ISBN|0160921953}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[\u010capljina]]]]\n{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the [[Paleolithic]], as one of the oldest paint caving was found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. Major Neolithic cultures such as the [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] and [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]] were present along the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] dated from c. 6230 BC \u2013 c. 4900 BC.\n\n=== Ancient Illyrians ===\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\n\nFrom 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by [[Daesitiates]] tribe most commonly associated with [[Central Bosnian cultural group]]. Iron Age [[Glasinac culture]] is associated with [[Autariatae]] tribe.\n\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]]. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17</ref> This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.<ref>Miller, Norma.

By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.

It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton Accords]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.\n\nThe [[Br\u010dko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Br\u010dko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Br\u010dko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.<ref name=\"OHR\">OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBesides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four \"official\" cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Isto\u010dno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).\n\nAs a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.\n\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHowever, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of \"Democracy\" without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref> International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.\n\n===Military===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.\n\nThe Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with ISAF peace missions to Afghanistan, [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in Afghanistan. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in Iraq, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.\n\nThe Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The Air Force has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country. The Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|newspaper=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064503/https://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|archive-date=2 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{main|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}\n[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007.

Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT) building, Sarajevo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] headquarter in [[Sarajevo]].]]\n\nSome television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are state-owned, and some are for-profit corporations funded by [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].\n\nAs a [[country in transition]] with a post-war legacy and a [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|complex domestic political structure]] Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995\u20132005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.<ref>Hozi\u0107, 2008; Thompson & De Luce, 2002; Kurspahi\u0107, 2003; Jusi\u0107, 2006</ref><ref name=\"EJC\">Tarik Jusi\u0107, \"[http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina |date=4 March 2016 }}\", EJC Media Landscapes</ref>\n\nPost-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.\nYet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andri\u0107]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko \u0160imi\u0107]], [[Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107]], [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinovi\u0107]], [[Miljenko Jergovi\u0107]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Ba\u0161agi\u0107]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Ko\u010di\u0107]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Ned\u017ead Ibri\u0161imovi\u0107. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107]].\nMagazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.\n\n===Art===\n{{main|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Ste\u0107ci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]\n\nThe art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Ste\u0107ci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromani\u0107|Kotromani\u0107]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurki\u0107]], [[Petar \u0160ain]], [[Roman Petrovi\u0107]] and [[Lazar Drlja\u010da]].\n\nAfter World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.\n\nIn 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}\n\nTypical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zoni\u0107]], [[Goran Bregovi\u0107]], [[Davorin Popovi\u0107]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]], [[Elvir Lakovi\u0107]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[\u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris D\u017einovi\u0107]], [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Du\u0161an \u0160esti\u0107]], the creator of the [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija \u0160esti\u0107]], to the world known jazz musician, educator and Bosnian jazz ambassador [[Sinan Alimanovi\u0107]], composer [[Sa\u0161a Lo\u0161i\u0107]] and pianist [[Sa\u0161a Toperi\u0107]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.\n\nProbably the most distinctive and identifiably \"Bosnian\" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.\n\n{{main|Bosnian root music}}\nRural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and \"ravne pjesme\" (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[\u0161argija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.\n[[File:43. TKB - Seljo z Sarajewa (Bo\u015bnia i Hercegowina) 10.JPG|thumb|Bosnians dancing a traditional [[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]]]\n\n''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|\u0161argija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Ba\u011flama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it's maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.\n\nStudio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from [[\u017divinice]] together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[\u017divinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.\n\n===Cinema and theatre===\n{{main|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}\n\nSarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.\n\nBosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Awards]] to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian screenwriters, directors and producers are [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]] (known for the Academy Award\u2013 and [[Golden Globe Award]]\u2013winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]\u2013winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards & Juries: International Jury \"Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816162458/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Ademir Kenovi\u0107]], Dino Mustafi\u0107, [[Ahmed Imamovi\u0107]], [[Pjer \u017dalica]], [[Aida Begi\u0107]], Adis Bakra\u010d, etc.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}\n[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]\nBosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]].

A year later a contract was signed with the Polish government to supply 1,200 steam locomotives within ten years to the [[Polskie Koleje Pa\u0144stwowe|Polish State Railways]] (PKP). The first locomotive was delivered on 7 April 1924.\n[[File:Parowoz Pm36-2.jpg|thumb|Pm36-2]]\n\nIn 1931, the first locomotive was exported to the [[Bulgarian State Railways]]. During 1935 and 1936, five electric locomotives were built under [[license]] from [[Metropolitan-Vickers]]. In 1935\u20131936, Fablok produced five [[Luxtorpeda]]s (fast [[railcar]]s) for PKP under the guidance of engineer [[Klemens Stefan Sielecki]]. They were based on the [[Austro-Daimler]]'s design, but substantially modified.\n\nTwo [[PKP class Pm36|experimental fast steam locomotives]] were built in 1937.  One of them (Pm36-1) had aerodynamic fairing, the other had a standard look. The idea was to test both engines in parallel to compare top speed, acceleration, coal and water consumption, etc. The Pm36-1 won a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|International Exposition of Art and Technology]] in 1937.\n\n=== World War II 1939-1945 ===\nDuring [[World War II]] Fablok was a part of the Association of German Locomotives Companies ({{lang-de|Deutsche Lokomotivbau-Vereinigung}}). Fablok was incorporated into [[Henschel & Son]] under the name ''Erste Lokomotivfabrik in Polen A.G. Chrzanow'' (1939\u20131941)<ref>[http://www.fablok.com.pl/index.php?l=en&c=2 History of Fablok.] Permanent exhibition in Chrzan\u00f3w, Fablok 2009.</ref> and from 1941 as ''Oberschlesische Lokomotivwerke Krenau''. Klemens Stefan Sielecki together with his colleagues from the technical bureau started hiding the technical documentation for steam, industrial diesel and electrical locomotives and moved them completely out of the plant in January 1945, since the Nazis wanted them destroyed. After Poland was liberated, this documentation proved vital for the re-construction efforts of the national railway industry, especially the diesel and electrical locomotives. This allowed Fablok to restart the production of these types.\n\n=== During communism 1945-1989 ===\n[[File:Fablok 35lat 5000Lokomotyw 1959.JPG|thumb|Group photo of Fablok employees celebrating the production of [[Indian locomotive class WP]] #5000, in 1959.]]\nThe company was nationalized in 1947, and the official name changed to Fablok. Sielecki was technical director in the post-war years until 1964. After that, he was technical advisor to the board until his retirement on March 31, 1971. Under his leadership, the production was re-established for multiple types of locomotives, 12 of that type were destined for export.\n\nExport markets for its standard-gauge passenger, fast, freight, and industrial steam locomotives were Albania, China, Hungary, India, Korea, Romania, and Vietnam. Narrow-gauge units were exported to Albania, Bulgaria, China, Romania, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. The last steam locomotive was produced in 1963. Fablok never produced boilers for its steam locomotives, these were supplied by ''Fabryka Budowy Kot\u0142\u00f3w'' (Boiler Construction Works) of [[Sosnowiec]] known as Fitzner and Gamper before 1945; later also by other producers.\n\nProduction of diesel locomotives started in 1948. From the early 1960s the product range diversified into rolling stock (rail and tram) components. In 1977, the production profile expanded into construction equipment and its name was changed into ''Fabryka Maszyn Budowlanych i Lokomotyw BUMAR-FABLOK'' (Factory of Building Machinery and Locomotives BUMAR-FABLOK). The factory was taken over by ''Zjednoczenie Przemyslu Maszyn Budowlanych BUMAR'' (BUMAR Association of Building Machinery Industry) in Warsaw. Production included excavators with bucket capacity of 1.2 cubic metre, cranes with 25-28 ton lifting capacity, self-propelled road cranes, and hydraulic telescopic jibs.\n\n=== After 1990 to present ===\nIn 1999, the company received [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001]] certification. The \"Fablok\" Employees\u2019 Joint Stock Company (JSC) was formed and registered in 2001.

Until 1947 the official name was ''First Factory of Locomotives in Poland Ltd.'' ({{lang-pl|Pierwsza Fabryka Lokomotyw w Polsce Sp. Akc.}}), Fablok being a widely used [[Syllabic abbreviation#Types of abbreviations|syllabic abbreviation]] of ''Fabryka Lokomotyw'', among others as the company's [[telegraphic address]]. It is now named \"BUMAR - FABLOK [[S.A. (corporation)]]\". Fablok is located in the town of [[Chrzan\u00f3w]] in Lesser Poland. As of 2009, Fablok no longer builds new locomotives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fablok.com.pl/index.php?l=pl&c=3 | title=Produkty (Products) | publisher=FABLOK S.A. | date=2009 | accessdate=26 July 2014 |language=Polish}}</ref><ref name=\"6Da\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fablok.com.pl/index.php?l=pl&c=2&id=163 | title=Lokomotywa spalinowa 6Da | publisher=FABLOK S.A. | work=Produkty. Lokomotywy (Products. Locomotives) | date=2009 | accessdate=26 July 2014 | language=Polish}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years 1919-1939 ===\nFablok was established in 1919. A year later a contract was signed with the Polish government to supply 1,200 steam locomotives within ten years to the [[Polskie Koleje Pa\u0144stwowe|Polish State Railways]] (PKP). The first locomotive was delivered on 7 April 1924.\n[[File:Parowoz Pm36-2.jpg|thumb|Pm36-2]]\n\nIn 1931, the first locomotive was exported to the [[Bulgarian State Railways]]. During 1935 and 1936, five electric locomotives were built under [[license]] from [[Metropolitan-Vickers]]. In 1935-1936, Fablok produced five [[Luxtorpeda]]s (fast [[railcar]]s) for PKP under the guidance of engineer [[Klemens Stefan Sielecki]]. They were based on the [[Austro-Daimler]]'s design, but substantially modified.\n\nTwo [[PKP class Pm36|experimental fast steam locomotives]] were built in 1937.  One of them (Pm36-1) had aerodynamic fairing, the other had a standard look. The idea was to test both engines in parallel to compare top speed, acceleration, coal and water consumption, etc. The Pm36-1 won a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|International Exposition of Art and Technology]] in 1937.\n\n=== World War II 1939-1945 ===\nDuring [[World War II]] Fablok was a part of the Association of German Locomotives Companies ({{lang-de|Deutsche Lokomotivbau-Vereinigung}}). Fablok was incorporated into [[Henschel & Son]] under the name ''Erste Lokomotivfabrik in Polen A.G. Chrzanow'' (1939\u20131941)<ref>[http://www.fablok.com.pl/index.php?l=en&c=2 History of Fablok.] Permanent exhibition in Chrzan\u00f3w, Fablok 2009.</ref> and from 1941 as ''Oberschlesische Lokomotivwerke Krenau''. Klemens Stefan Sielecki together with his colleagues from the technical bureau started hiding the technical documentation for steam, industrial diesel and electrical locomotives and moved them completely out of the plant in January 1945, since the Nazis wanted them destroyed. After Poland was liberated, this documentation proved vital for the re-construction efforts of the national railway industry, especially the diesel and electrical locomotives. This allowed Fablok to restart the production of these types.\n\n=== During communism 1945-1989 ===\n[[File:Fablok 35lat 5000Lokomotyw 1959.JPG|thumb|Group photo of Fablok employees celebrating the production of [[Indian locomotive class WP]] #5000, in 1959.]]\nThe company was nationalized in 1947, and the official name changed to Fablok. Sielecki was technical director in the post-war years until 1964. After that, he was technical advisor to the board until his retirement on March 31, 1971. Under his leadership, the production was re-established for multiple types of locomotives, 12 of that type were destined for export.\n\nExport markets for its standard-gauge passenger, fast, freight, and industrial steam locomotives were Albania, China, Hungary, India, Korea, Romania, and Vietnam. Narrow-gauge units were exported to Albania, Bulgaria, China, Romania, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. The last steam locomotive was produced in 1963. Fablok never produced boilers for its steam locomotives, these were supplied by ''Fabryka Budowy Kot\u0142\u00f3w'' (Boiler Construction Works) of [[Sosnowiec]] known as Fitzner and Gamper before 1945; later also by other producers.\n\nProduction of diesel locomotives started in 1948. From the early 1960s the product range diversified into rolling stock (rail and tram) components. In 1977, the production profile expanded into construction equipment and its name was changed into ''Fabryka Maszyn Budowlanych i Lokomotyw BUMAR-FABLOK'' (Factory of Building Machinery and Locomotives BUMAR-FABLOK). The factory was taken over by ''Zjednoczenie Przemyslu Maszyn Budowlanych BUMAR'' (BUMAR Association of Building Machinery Industry) in Warsaw. Production included excavators with bucket capacity of 1.2 cubic metre, cranes with 25-28 ton lifting capacity, self-propelled road cranes, and hydraulic telescopic jibs.\n\n=== After 1990 to present ===\nIn 1999, the company received [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001]] certification. The \"Fablok\" Employees\u2019 Joint Stock Company (JSC) was formed and registered in 2001. After first purchasing of 60% of the controlling shares of Bumar-Fablok JSC by \"FABLOK\" - Employees\u2019 Joint Stock Company from the 7th State Investment Fund (part of the privatization reforms) in 2003, the \"Bumar-Fablok\" Joint Stock Company ownership was transferred to the Fablok Employees\u2019 Joint Stock Company.\n\nOn April 3, 2009, the name of the company was changed to ''Pierwsza Fabryka Lokomotyw w Polsce \u201cFablok\u201d S.A'' (First Factory of Locomotives in Poland \u201cFablok\u201d Joint Stock Company).\n\non May 21st 2013, court in [[Krak\u00f3w]] had announced the [[Bankruptcy]] Of the company. the wealth of Fablok was bought by Martech Plus with th Headquarters in \u0141aziska G\u00f3rne\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.fablok.com.pl/index.php?lang=en Official webpage.

The College was originally intended to provide instruction in the arts and humanities for women.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/sarah-lawrence-college/|title=Sarah Lawrence College|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}</ref> A major component of the College's early curriculum was \"productive leisure,\" wherein students were required to work for eight hours weekly in such fields as [[model (person)|modeling]], [[shorthand]], [[typewriting]], applying [[makeup]], and [[gardening]].<ref name=\"leisure\">{{cite book|author=Kaplan, Barbara|title=Becoming Sarah Lawrence|publisher=Sarah Lawrence College|date=29 January 2014|url=http://www.slc.edu/magazine/75th-anniversary/founding/becoming.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204005918/http://www.slc.edu/magazine/75th-anniversary/founding/becoming.html|archivedate=4 February 2014}}</ref> Its pedagogy, modeled on the tutorial system of [[Oxford University]], combined independent research projects, individually supervised by the teaching faculty, and seminars with low student-to-faculty ratio\u2014a pattern it retains to the present, despite its cost.

Taylor, elected president at age 30, maintained a friendship with [[Philosophy of education|educational philosopher]] [[John Dewey]], and worked to employ the [[John Dewey#Deweyan pragmatism|Dewey method]] at Sarah Lawrence. Taylor spent much of his career calling for educational reform in the [[United States]], using the success of  Sarah Lawrence as an example of the possibilities of a personalized, modern, and rigorous approach to [[higher education]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Bruce|title=Harold Taylor, Novel Educator And College President, Dies at 78|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/nyregion/harold-taylor-novel-educator-and-college-president-dies-at-78.html|website=NYTimes.com|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nSarah Lawrence became a coeducational institution in 1968.

She was a friend of [[Vassar College]] president Henry MacCracken and of Sarah Lawrence founder William Van Duzer Lawrence. Coats had traditional views of women's role in society that were at odds with her progressive approach to women's education. Cristle Collins Judd was introduced as president in 2017.\n\n==Academics==\nAt the [[undergraduate]] level, Sarah Lawrence offers an alternative to traditional [[Academic major|majors]]. Students pursue a wide variety of courses in four different curricular distributions: the Creative Arts (writing, music, dance, theatre, [[film studies|film]], and the plastic arts, such as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture); history and the social sciences (e.g., [[anthropology]], economics, political science, and sociology); the humanities (e.g., Asian studies, art history, film studies, languages, literature, philosophy, and religion); and natural science and mathematics (biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics). Classes are structured around a seminar-conference system through which students learn in small, highly interactive seminars and private tutorials with professors. Each student is assigned to a faculty advisor, known as a \"don,\" who helps the student plan a course of study and provides ongoing academic guidance.  Most courses, apart from those in the performing arts, consist of two parts: the [[seminar]], limited to 15 students, and conferences, which is a meeting with a seminar [[professor]].  In these conferences, students develop individual projects that extend the course material and link it to their personal interests.  Sarah Lawrence has no required courses, and traditional [[examinations]] have largely been supplanted by [[Term paper|research papers]].  Additionally, [[Grade (education)|grades]] are recorded only for transcript purposes\u2014[[narrative evaluation]]s are given in lieu of grades.<ref>{{cite web | title = At a Glance: About SLC | publisher = Sarah Lawrence College | accessdate = 2014-01-29 | url = http://www.slc.edu/about/}}</ref> The College sponsors [[Study abroad|international programs]] in [[Florence]], at [[Wadham College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], at [[Reid Hall]] in [[Paris]], and at the British American Drama Academy in [[London]].

Qualified students also have the opportunity to participate in Lang's exchange program at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].\n* [[Spelman College|Spelman College Exchange Program]]: Beginning in spring 2007, female SLC students began participating in an exchange program with Spelman College in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/japan/|title=Sarah Lawrence Study Abroad in Japan|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Pitzer College|Pitzer College Exchange Program]]\n* [[California Institute of the Arts|California Institute of the Arts Exchange Program]]\n* Kansai Gaidai University (Asian Studies Program) Osaka, Japan\n* Tsuda University (Private Women's University) Tokyo, Japan\n\n===International programs===\nThe College has a number of international programs in four countries.  Sarah Lawrence makes all practical efforts to preserve its most characteristic elements, such as one-on-one interaction with professors, small classes, and an emphasis on qualitative comprehension, in its programs overseas.\n* [[Havana]]: In place since 2000, this program is the longest-running in Cuba by an American university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/havana/|title=Study Abroad in Havana, Cuba|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> The course offerings at the University of Havana include Afro-Cuban culture, art history, Cuban or Latin American cinema, Cuban history, Latin American studies, literature, psychology, urban and rural sociology, U.S.-Cuban relations, and women's studies. All courses are taught by Cuban faculty and are attended by Cuban students. Each student is also required to enroll in an advanced Spanish course. The most distinctive feature is an affiliation with Centro de Estudios Demogr\u00e1ficos (CEDEM), one of the research centers at the University of Havana. At CEDEM students meet with experts whose research and professional expertise focus on developments in contemporary Cuban society. Students select a research topic and are paired with a professor from CEDEM with whom they meet on a regular basis, much like the regular conference structure.\n* [[London]]: Jointly sponsored by the British American Drama Academy and Sarah Lawrence College, the program expands Sarah Lawrence's long-standing and vibrant tradition in the performing arts by exposing students to the rigors of professional British training in acting. The faculty includes some of Britain's most distinguished actors and directors. The heart of each student's program is scene study in classical and modern works. Students also take courses in voice, movement, and stage fighting and participate in fully staged performances at the end of each term.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n* [[Oxford]]: Since 1985, Sarah Lawrence College has been associated with [[Wadham College]], one of the undergraduate colleges of [[Oxford University]] in [[England]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This program is open to select juniors and seniors. Students are best prepared to undertake the demands of Oxford if their coursework in their first and sophomore years have included significant analytical and written work.\n* [[Leeds]]: Students who are admitted into the [[University of Leeds]] program have access to a variety of disciplines and academic strengths. The academic year runs from September through the end of May and is made up of two semesters. Students will take a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials, with additional time for private study, labs (sciences) and fieldwork. Students will meet with a Sarah Lawrence program advisor in determining their course of study each semester.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n* [[Dartington]]: A highly competitive, music based exchange with Dartington College of the Arts in southern [[England]]. The program is open to qualified students with interest in experimental music and media.\n* [[Paris]]: Centered at historic [[Reid Hall]] in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter of Paris, the program is Sarah Lawrence's oldest and focuses on the humanities and creative arts. The program is conducted entirely in French and includes one required French-language class and three other courses of the student's choosing. Classes may be taken at the University of Paris, Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques, the Ecole du Louvre, and the Institut Catholique, or other, more specialized institutions.\n* [[Catania]]: Open to students who have an advanced comprehension of [[Italian language|Italian]], the Catania program takes advantage of its [[Sicily|Sicilian]] setting to provide students with an experience in cultural immersion.  Students enroll directly at the University of Catania and choose courses offered by the Humanities department, including: Medieval History, Modern Italian Literature, History of Philosophy, Archaeology, Greek and Roman Art History, History of Theatrical Arts, Comparative Literature, Byzantine History, and the History of Europe.\n\n===Graduate programs===\nSarah Lawrence offers nine graduate programs, each of which confers the [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], or [[Master of Science]] degree upon its graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/graduate/programs/ |title=Sarah Lawrence Graduate Programs|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018 }}</ref>  In contrast to highly specialized, [[research]]-oriented [[Ph.D.|doctoral study]], these programs reflect the emphasis on [[interdisciplinary]] studies and the close student-teacher relationship that have come to be characteristic of the College's undergraduate program.  Intensive work with faculty members, small [[seminar]]s, and one-on-one conferences form the foundation of the curricular model.  According to their own literature, the programs make an effort to balance the \"theoretical (usually discussed in seminars and conferences) with the practical (in the form of [[fieldwork]], [[practicum]]s, research or creative work). This [[experiential learning|experiential work]] is most often conducted not in isolation, but in the midst of a community. Interdisciplinary work and ideas are encouraged, as is an [[ethics|ethic]] of [[social responsibility]].\"  There are approximately 298 graduate students at Sarah Lawrence.\n\n====Art of Teaching====\nThe Sarah Lawrence College Art of Teaching Program offers training in [[education]] in both degree-track and [[continuing education]] formats. One component of the program is the Empowering Teachers Program, which was established in 1989 as a forum for the support of teachers and educational administrators, and has since expanded into a resource and network for more than 250 beginning and experienced professionals from 25 [[school district]]s in [[Westchester County]] and adjacent areas of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Connecticut]] and [[New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Rankings===\n{{details|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}\n\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| Forbes   = 157\n| USNWR_LA = 68\n| Wamo_LA  = 140\n| THE_WSJ  = 157\n}}\n\nIn 2007, criticism of [[College and university rankings|rankings]] of U.S. colleges and universities, particularly their perceived impact on the [[College admissions in the United States|college admissions process]], gained national prominence due in part to the March 11, 2007 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article \"The Cost of Bucking College Rankings\" by [[Sarah Lawrence College#Outgoing president|Dr. Michele Tolela Myers]], a former president of Sarah Lawrence College.

Of this decision, Myers states, \"We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.\"<ref name=\"Tolela Myers\">{{cite news | first = Michele | last = Tolela Myers | title = The Cost of Bucking College Rankings | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 11 March 2007 | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030901836.html }}</ref> At the time, Sarah Lawrence was the only American college that completely disregarded SAT scores in its admission process.<ref name=\"U.S. News and World Report\">{{cite web| title =U.S. News Statement on College Rankings| publisher =[[U.S. News and World Report]]| date =12 March 2007| url =https://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070312/us_news_statement_on_college_r.htm| archive-url =https://archive.is/20130105063209/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070312/us_news_statement_on_college_r.htm| url-status =dead| archive-date =5 January 2013}}</ref>  As a result of this policy, in the same ''The Washington Post'' article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' that if no SAT scores were submitted, ''U.S. News'' would \"make up a number\" to use in its magazines.

Despite this public stance opposing these rankings, the 2019 annual ranking of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Sarah Lawrence tied for the 65th best liberal arts college in the nation.\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' rated it 133rd overall in its America's Top Colleges ranking, which includes 660 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. That same year, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' rankings ranked Sarah Lawrence 144th in the liberal arts college category.\n\n==Political involvement and activism==\n[[Political activism]] has played a crucial role in forming the spirit of the Sarah Lawrence community since the early years of the College.  As early as 1938, students were [[volunteering]] in [[working-class]] sections of Yonkers, New York to help bring [[Civil Rights Movement|equality and educational opportunities]] to [[poverty|poor]] and [[minority group|minority]] citizens, and the Sarah Lawrence College War Board, organized by students in the fall of 1942, sought to aid troops fighting in [[World War II]].  During a time when the College's enrollment consisted of only 293 students, 204 signed up as volunteers during the first week of the War Board.<ref name=\"warboard\">{{cite book|author=Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz|title=Alma Mater: Design and Experience in the Women's Colleges from Their Nineteenth-Century Beginnings to the 1930s|location=Amherst|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1993|authorlink=Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz}}</ref>  During the so-called [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Years]], a number of Sarah Lawrence's faculty members were accused by the [[American Legion]] of being sympathetic to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and were called before the Jenner Committee.<ref name=\"mccarthy\">{{cite book|author=Fried, Richard M.  |title=Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990}}</ref> Since that time, activism has played a central role in student life, with movements for [[civil rights]] and against [[the Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and for student and faculty [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the 1980s. Also in the 1960s, students established an [[Upward Bound]] program for students from lower-income and poverty areas to prepare for college.<ref name=\"upwardbound\">[[United States]]. [[United States Congress]].  Joint Committee.  ''A Directory of Urban Research Study Centers''.  Washington: United States Congress, 1977.</ref>  Theatre Outreach, the Child Development Institute, the [[Sarah Lawrence College Art of Teaching Program|Empowering Teachers Program]], the Community Writers program, the Office of Community Partnership, and the Fulbright High School Writers Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community. In the late 1980s, students occupied Westlands, the main administrative building for the campus, in a sit-in for wider diversity. Students occupied Westlands again in 2016, in a sit-in supporting improved wages and safer working conditions for the college's recently unionized facilities workers. For many years, the College has been considered as being at the vanguard of the [[gay rights|sexual rights]] movement and many progressive causes.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Westlands.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Westlands House]]\n\nThe {{convert|42|acre|ha|adj=on}} Sarah Lawrence campus is atop a promontory above the banks of the [[Bronx River]].  Much of the campus was originally a part of the estate of the College's founder, [[William Van Duzer Lawrence]], though the College has more than doubled its size since Lawrence bequeathed his estate to the College in 1926.  The terrain is characterized by dramatic outcroppings of exposed [[bedrock]] shaded by large oak and elm trees.  Many of the older buildings are in the [[Tudor Revival architecture]] style that was popular in the area during the early 20th century, and many of the College's newer buildings attempt an updated interpretation of the same style.  The campus is divided into two distinctive sections, the \"Old Campus\" and the \"New Campus\":  the first is roughly contained within the boundaries of the former Lawrence estate, and the area of the second was acquired sometime after the College's earliest years.\n\nThe area outside the original Lawrence estate holds the College's newer facilities.  Several stately, century-old, Tudor-style mansions will be found among these newer additions, including Andrews, Tweed, Lynd, Marshall Field, and Slonim House:  each was once a private estate, purchased by the college during periods of growth and expansion.  The more modest Tudor houses along Mead Way, which also had been private residences, now serve as dormitories for students at the College.  \"Slonim Woods\" is a group of newer, townhouse-style dormitories, built on the grounds of Slonim House.\n\nThe Campbell Sports Center was constructed in 1998 in response to an increased focus on physical fitness and sports. This facility includes an indoor pool, gymnasium, track, squash courts, and weight rooms.\n\nIn 2004, the College completed construction of a modern visual arts facility, the Monika A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center, with sleek architecture and [[environmentally friendly]] aspects which earned the College national press attention.  Just down the road is Hill House, a six-story apartment building purchased by the College in the late 1990s that now lodges students.  Across the street from Hill House is the large Wrexham house, also in the Tudor style, which the College purchased from the government of [[Rwanda]] in 2004; this building, once home to the Rwandan consul, has been renovated and is used for various postgraduate programs.  At the opposite end of the campus stands the Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994.\n\n===Buildings===\n{{multiple image|header = '''Campus Buildings'''\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|align = right\n|image1 =\n|caption1 = Bates\n|image2 = SLCLibrary.jpg\n|caption2 = The Esther Raushenbush Library\n|image3 = SLCVisualArtsCenter.JPG\n|caption3 = Heimbold Visual Arts Center\n|image4 = Siegel Student Center.JPG\n|caption4 = Siegel Student Center\n|image5 = Sarah Lawrence Westlands 2.jpg\n|caption5 = Westlands\n|image6 = SLCTweed.JPG\n|caption6 = Tweed House\n|image7 = SLCSlonimHouse.JPG\n|caption7 = Slonim House\n|image8 = SLC Dorms.JPG\n|caption8 = North Lawn and old dorms\n|image9 = Marshall Field.JPG\n|caption9 = Marshall Field\n|image10 = Sarah Lawrence Tea Haus.jpg\n|caption10 = The Tea Haus\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|align = right\n|image1 = Westlands Lawn.JPG\n|caption1 = Center campus\n|image2 =\n|caption2 = New Dorms\n|image3 =\n|caption3 = Mead Way Houses\n}}\n\n====Academic facilities====\n* '''The Barbara Walters Campus Center''' is the newest building on campus. Finished in the fall of 2019, the building is named for alumna [[Barbara Walters]]. The building boasts a flexible multipurpose space which is used for dances, speeches, class gatherings, etc. On the second floor is the Barbara Walters Reading Room. It includes a rotating exhibition, but currently holds artifacts from Barbara Walters' life. The building has a green roof energy efficient LED lighting.\n* '''Bates Center for Student Life''' is one of the original campus buildings. A huge facility designed in the English Tudor style that is common in the area, it has housed not just offices and classrooms, but everything from maids\u2019 quarters to dining halls to laboratories and arts facilities. At one time, it was home to a miniature basketball court that is now a faculty dining room, though the lines of the court can still be seen on the floors. Over the years, programs in science, visual arts, and physical education have grown to the point that they have spilled over elsewhere on the campus, requiring three buildings of their own. Bates has always been home to the College's main dining facility and also houses the popular \"Health Food Bar.\"<ref>[http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/social/Bates_Center_for_Student_Life.html SLC Campus - Bates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204010051/http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/social/Bates_Center_for_Student_Life.html |date=2014-02-04 }}</ref>\n* '''The Esther Raushenbush Library''', designed in 1974 by Walter, Burns, Toan & Lundein an architectural style meant to interpret in a more modern and sleek fashion the implied buttresses and strong features of its much older neighbor, Andrews House.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=American Architecture - Westchester County, New York Colonial to Contemporary|author=Frank Sanchis|publisher=North River Press|date=1977|page=426}}</ref> The Raushenbush Library houses over 300,000 volumes.<ref>[http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/academic-arts/The_Esther_Raushenbush_Library.html SLC.edu - Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204005913/http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/academic-arts/The_Esther_Raushenbush_Library.html |date=2014-02-04 }}</ref>\n* '''The Alice Stone Ilchman Science and Mathematics Center''', completed in 1994, is situated on the far north end of the campus.

The jury applauded its inventive use of materials; consistent development of the project in relation to the original concept; well-integrated plan/section; and exemplary use of building siting, solar orientation, daylighting, and locally quarried fieldstone to achieve LEED certification.

During the 1970s, the space was remodeled and christened \u201cThe Pub\u201d for use as an informal dining hall and as a space for student activities. During the 1980s, it was renamed \u201cCharlie\u2019s Place,\u201d honoring former President DeCarlo. In 1998, the entire structure was renovated, an addition was built by the architects [[Buttrick White & Burtis]], and the new complex took on its current official name.

After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect [[Philip Johnson]] in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a caf\u00e9 selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it is a fact that the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, there seems to be no evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member [[Joseph Campbell]].\n\n====Administration buildings====\n* '''Andrews Annex''', built in the 1990s adjacent to Andrews House, houses a number of administrative offices.\n* '''Lyles House''' is home to the College's Health Services Center.\n* '''The President's House''', built in 1921 and designed by architect Louis Bowman of [[McKim, Mead & White]], is an example of 16th century Tudor-style architecture.

At present, the majority of the apartments in the building are occupied by students, but a number of them remain in the possession of the original tenants who occupied them when the building was purchased by Sarah Lawrence. Most of the apartments are quite large and each has a full kitchen. Apartments on the upper floors with south-facing windows have, on clear days, a view of the [[Empire State Building]].\n* '''Kober''' is home to dorm rooms, but is also a part of the Early Childhood Education complex.  It was donated to the college in 1951 by Otto Frohnknecht in memory of his daughter, Margaret Frohnknecht Kober, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1935.  There was once a [[bowling alley]] in its basement.\n* '''Morrill''' is the former maid's quarters to the President's House, and now is home to faculty offices.\n* '''Slonim House''' was formerly a manor house that is now occupied by dorms and by the college's Center for Continuing Education and Office of Graduate Studies.\n* '''Slonim Woods''' is the group of 10 purpose-built living facilities constructed in 1977. They consist of eight single person dorm rooms arranged around a central communal living space.\n\n=====Old dorms=====\nThe \"Old dorms\" refer to four original purpose-built student housing structures to the immediate north of Westlands in what is frequently referred to as the \"central campus\". Dudley Lawrence, one of the sons of William and Sarah Lawrence, achieved the remarkable feat of constructing three of these buildings in one year (1926\u20131927). The halls were designed by [[William Augustus Bates]], who repeated the Neo-Tudor style of Westlands through the use of stone and timber materials, and mansard roofs.  The interiors are also in keeping with the English Tudor architectural style found on most of the older buildings in the area, with thick plaster walls, hardwood floors, and leaded windows (since replaced with more energy-efficient double-pane windows). MacCracken, built a few years later than the other three, is situated to the south of Dudley Lawrence. The original elegant living rooms that were found in each building, excepting MacCracken, are now used as classrooms.<ref>[http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&d=p1506 Central Campus - \"old dorms\" - Historic Campus Architecture Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727204303/http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&d=p1506 |date=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n* '''Dudley Lawrence''', houses two classrooms in addition to living spaces. It is named for William Lawrence's son, who oversaw the construction of the Old Dorms.\n* '''OSilas''', originally named Gilbert for one of the college's original trustees, is the northernmost building of the four and is known for being quiet and populated with the College's more studious set.\n* '''MacCracken''', named for [[Vassar College]] president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]], is a few years younger than its neighbors and has, at various times, housed the college library, the bookstore, and a number of other facilities in addition to living spaces.  Although it still serves as a dormitory, it now also houses dance studios, meeting spaces, and administrative offices.\n* '''Titsworth''' is an all-girls dorm and was also named for one of the college's founding trustees.  It occupies the space between Gilbert and Dudley Lawrence and is also home to the Titsworth Lecture Hall.\n\n=====New dorms=====\n[[File:RGT-SLC-10.2016.jpg|alt=Pictured: Rothschild, Garrison, and Taylor Residence Halls (left to right) housed in one continuous, multi-level building. There are two visible entrances. The entrance connecting Rothschild and Garrison is one floor above the entrance connecting Garrison to Taylor, as the path along the building is at a slight incline. There are large rock formations visible in front of the building between the entrances, and medium-sized trees on the small patch of grass in front of the building.|thumb|Rothschild, Garrison, and Taylor (left to right)]]\nDesigned by the renowned architect [[Philip Johnson]] in the sparse modernist style of the time, the \"New Dorms\" were completed in 1960. The architectural style of the buildings is meant to be a modernist reflection of the three older dorms (Gilbert, Titsworth, and Dudley Lawrence) that stand on the opposite side of the North Lawn. The three buildings that comprise the New Dorms are connected by two glass atria in which the buildings' primary stairwells are found. With the exception of the large apartments in Rothschild, these dorms typically house first-year students.\n* '''Rothschild''' comprises apartment style, air-conditioned dorm spaces with kitchens, living rooms, and an elevator.  The basement houses a number of small classrooms and studios in use predominantly by the theater department.\n* '''Garrison''' is a traditional dormitory-style building with shared bathrooms.\n* '''Taylor''' is nearly a replica in the design of its neighbor, Garrison.\n\n=====The Mead Way houses=====\nThe Mead Way Houses are the eight former private homes that stand along the steep hill of Mead Way on the college's eastern end. The two southernmost houses, Robinson and Swinford, are occupied by administrative offices and the office of the campus internet radio station, and the northernmost six houses, listed below, are reserved for student living spaces.  The northern houses include:\n* '''Brebner House'''\n* '''Mansell House'''\n* '''Morris House'''\n* '''Perkins House'''\n* '''Schmidt House'''\n* '''Warren Green House'''\n\n==Athletics==\nSarah Lawrence College is the member of [[Skyline Conference]] of [[NCAA Division III]].

Coats had traditional views of women's role in society that were at odds with her progressive approach to women's education. Cristle Collins Judd was introduced as president in 2017.\n\n==Academics==\nAt the [[undergraduate]] level, Sarah Lawrence offers an alternative to traditional [[Academic major|majors]]. Students pursue a wide variety of courses in four different curricular distributions: the Creative Arts (writing, music, dance, theatre, [[film studies|film]], and the plastic arts, such as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture); history and the social sciences (e.g., [[anthropology]], economics, political science, and sociology); the humanities (e.g., Asian studies, art history, film studies, languages, literature, philosophy, and religion); and natural science and mathematics (biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics). Classes are structured around a seminar-conference system through which students learn in small, highly interactive seminars and private tutorials with professors. Each student is assigned to a faculty advisor, known as a \"don,\" who helps the student plan a course of study and provides ongoing academic guidance.  Most courses, apart from those in the performing arts, consist of two parts: the [[seminar]], limited to 15 students, and conferences, which is a meeting with a seminar [[professor]].  In these conferences, students develop individual projects that extend the course material and link it to their personal interests.  Sarah Lawrence has no required courses, and traditional [[examinations]] have largely been supplanted by [[Term paper|research papers]].  Additionally, [[Grade (education)|grades]] are recorded only for transcript purposes\u2014[[narrative evaluation]]s are given in lieu of grades.<ref>{{cite web | title = At a Glance: About SLC | publisher = Sarah Lawrence College | accessdate = 2014-01-29 | url = http://www.slc.edu/about/}}</ref> The College sponsors [[Study abroad|international programs]] in [[Florence]], at [[Wadham College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], at [[Reid Hall]] in [[Paris]], and at the British American Drama Academy in [[London]].

All courses are taught by Cuban faculty and are attended by Cuban students. Each student is also required to enroll in an advanced Spanish course. The most distinctive feature is an affiliation with Centro de Estudios Demogr\u00e1ficos (CEDEM), one of the research centers at the University of Havana. At CEDEM students meet with experts whose research and professional expertise focus on developments in contemporary Cuban society. Students select a research topic and are paired with a professor from CEDEM with whom they meet on a regular basis, much like the regular conference structure.\n* [[London]]: Jointly sponsored by the British American Drama Academy and Sarah Lawrence College, the program expands Sarah Lawrence's long-standing and vibrant tradition in the performing arts by exposing students to the rigors of professional British training in acting. The faculty includes some of Britain's most distinguished actors and directors. The heart of each student's program is scene study in classical and modern works. Students also take courses in voice, movement, and stage fighting and participate in fully staged performances at the end of each term.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n* [[Oxford]]: Since 1985, Sarah Lawrence College has been associated with [[Wadham College]], one of the undergraduate colleges of [[Oxford University]] in [[England]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This program is open to select juniors and seniors.

Students enroll directly at the University of Catania and choose courses offered by the Humanities department, including: Medieval History, Modern Italian Literature, History of Philosophy, Archaeology, Greek and Roman Art History, History of Theatrical Arts, Comparative Literature, Byzantine History, and the History of Europe.\n\n===Graduate programs===\nSarah Lawrence offers nine graduate programs, each of which confers the [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], or [[Master of Science]] degree upon its graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/graduate/programs/ |title=Sarah Lawrence Graduate Programs|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018 }}</ref>  In contrast to highly specialized, [[research]]-oriented [[Ph.D.|doctoral study]], these programs reflect the emphasis on [[interdisciplinary]] studies and the close student-teacher relationship that have come to be characteristic of the College's undergraduate program.  Intensive work with faculty members, small [[seminar]]s, and one-on-one conferences form the foundation of the curricular model.  According to their own literature, the programs make an effort to balance the \"theoretical (usually discussed in seminars and conferences) with the practical (in the form of [[fieldwork]], [[practicum]]s, research or creative work). This [[experiential learning|experiential work]] is most often conducted not in isolation, but in the midst of a community. Interdisciplinary work and ideas are encouraged, as is an [[ethics|ethic]] of [[social responsibility]].\"  There are approximately 298 graduate students at Sarah Lawrence.\n\n====Art of Teaching====\nThe Sarah Lawrence College Art of Teaching Program offers training in [[education]] in both degree-track and [[continuing education]] formats. One component of the program is the Empowering Teachers Program, which was established in 1989 as a forum for the support of teachers and educational administrators, and has since expanded into a resource and network for more than 250 beginning and experienced professionals from 25 [[school district]]s in [[Westchester County]] and adjacent areas of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Connecticut]] and [[New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Rankings===\n{{details|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}\n\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| Forbes   = 157\n| USNWR_LA = 68\n| Wamo_LA  = 140\n| THE_WSJ  = 157\n}}\n\nIn 2007, criticism of [[College and university rankings|rankings]] of U.S. colleges and universities, particularly their perceived impact on the [[College admissions in the United States|college admissions process]], gained national prominence due in part to the March 11, 2007 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article \"The Cost of Bucking College Rankings\" by [[Sarah Lawrence College#Outgoing president|Dr. Michele Tolela Myers]], a former president of Sarah Lawrence College.

Of this decision, Myers states, \"We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.\"<ref name=\"Tolela Myers\">{{cite news | first = Michele | last = Tolela Myers | title = The Cost of Bucking College Rankings | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 11 March 2007 | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030901836.html }}</ref> At the time, Sarah Lawrence was the only American college that completely disregarded SAT scores in its admission process.<ref name=\"U.S. News and World Report\">{{cite web| title =U.S. News Statement on College Rankings| publisher =[[U.S. News and World Report]]| date =12 March 2007| url =https://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070312/us_news_statement_on_college_r.htm| archive-url =https://archive.is/20130105063209/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070312/us_news_statement_on_college_r.htm| url-status =dead| archive-date =5 January 2013}}</ref>  As a result of this policy, in the same ''The Washington Post'' article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' that if no SAT scores were submitted, ''U.S. News'' would \"make up a number\" to use in its magazines.

Despite this public stance opposing these rankings, the 2019 annual ranking of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Sarah Lawrence tied for the 65th best liberal arts college in the nation.\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' rated it 133rd overall in its America's Top Colleges ranking, which includes 660 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. That same year, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' rankings ranked Sarah Lawrence 144th in the liberal arts college category.\n\n==Political involvement and activism==\n[[Political activism]] has played a crucial role in forming the spirit of the Sarah Lawrence community since the early years of the College.  As early as 1938, students were [[volunteering]] in [[working-class]] sections of Yonkers, New York to help bring [[Civil Rights Movement|equality and educational opportunities]] to [[poverty|poor]] and [[minority group|minority]] citizens, and the Sarah Lawrence College War Board, organized by students in the fall of 1942, sought to aid troops fighting in [[World War II]].  During a time when the College's enrollment consisted of only 293 students, 204 signed up as volunteers during the first week of the War Board.<ref name=\"warboard\">{{cite book|author=Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz|title=Alma Mater: Design and Experience in the Women's Colleges from Their Nineteenth-Century Beginnings to the 1930s|location=Amherst|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1993|authorlink=Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz}}</ref>  During the so-called [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Years]], a number of Sarah Lawrence's faculty members were accused by the [[American Legion]] of being sympathetic to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and were called before the Jenner Committee.<ref name=\"mccarthy\">{{cite book|author=Fried, Richard M.  |title=Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990}}</ref> Since that time, activism has played a central role in student life, with movements for [[civil rights]] and against [[the Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and for student and faculty [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the 1980s.

[[United States Congress]].  Joint Committee.  ''A Directory of Urban Research Study Centers''.  Washington: United States Congress, 1977.</ref>  Theatre Outreach, the Child Development Institute, the [[Sarah Lawrence College Art of Teaching Program|Empowering Teachers Program]], the Community Writers program, the Office of Community Partnership, and the Fulbright High School Writers Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community. In the late 1980s, students occupied Westlands, the main administrative building for the campus, in a sit-in for wider diversity. Students occupied Westlands again in 2016, in a sit-in supporting improved wages and safer working conditions for the college's recently unionized facilities workers. For many years, the College has been considered as being at the vanguard of the [[gay rights|sexual rights]] movement and many progressive causes.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Westlands.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Westlands House]]\n\nThe {{convert|42|acre|ha|adj=on}} Sarah Lawrence campus is atop a promontory above the banks of the [[Bronx River]].  Much of the campus was originally a part of the estate of the College's founder, [[William Van Duzer Lawrence]], though the College has more than doubled its size since Lawrence bequeathed his estate to the College in 1926.  The terrain is characterized by dramatic outcroppings of exposed [[bedrock]] shaded by large oak and elm trees.  Many of the older buildings are in the [[Tudor Revival architecture]] style that was popular in the area during the early 20th century, and many of the College's newer buildings attempt an updated interpretation of the same style.  The campus is divided into two distinctive sections, the \"Old Campus\" and the \"New Campus\":  the first is roughly contained within the boundaries of the former Lawrence estate, and the area of the second was acquired sometime after the College's earliest years.\n\nThe area outside the original Lawrence estate holds the College's newer facilities.  Several stately, century-old, Tudor-style mansions will be found among these newer additions, including Andrews, Tweed, Lynd, Marshall Field, and Slonim House:  each was once a private estate, purchased by the college during periods of growth and expansion.  The more modest Tudor houses along Mead Way, which also had been private residences, now serve as dormitories for students at the College.  \"Slonim Woods\" is a group of newer, townhouse-style dormitories, built on the grounds of Slonim House.\n\nThe Campbell Sports Center was constructed in 1998 in response to an increased focus on physical fitness and sports. This facility includes an indoor pool, gymnasium, track, squash courts, and weight rooms.\n\nIn 2004, the College completed construction of a modern visual arts facility, the Monika A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center, with sleek architecture and [[environmentally friendly]] aspects which earned the College national press attention.  Just down the road is Hill House, a six-story apartment building purchased by the College in the late 1990s that now lodges students.  Across the street from Hill House is the large Wrexham house, also in the Tudor style, which the College purchased from the government of [[Rwanda]] in 2004; this building, once home to the Rwandan consul, has been renovated and is used for various postgraduate programs.  At the opposite end of the campus stands the Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994.\n\n===Buildings===\n{{multiple image|header = '''Campus Buildings'''\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|align = right\n|image1 =\n|caption1 = Bates\n|image2 = SLCLibrary.jpg\n|caption2 = The Esther Raushenbush Library\n|image3 = SLCVisualArtsCenter.JPG\n|caption3 = Heimbold Visual Arts Center\n|image4 = Siegel Student Center.JPG\n|caption4 = Siegel Student Center\n|image5 = Sarah Lawrence Westlands 2.jpg\n|caption5 = Westlands\n|image6 = SLCTweed.JPG\n|caption6 = Tweed House\n|image7 = SLCSlonimHouse.JPG\n|caption7 = Slonim House\n|image8 = SLC Dorms.JPG\n|caption8 = North Lawn and old dorms\n|image9 = Marshall Field.JPG\n|caption9 = Marshall Field\n|image10 = Sarah Lawrence Tea Haus.jpg\n|caption10 = The Tea Haus\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|align = right\n|image1 = Westlands Lawn.JPG\n|caption1 = Center campus\n|image2 =\n|caption2 = New Dorms\n|image3 =\n|caption3 = Mead Way Houses\n}}\n\n====Academic facilities====\n* '''The Barbara Walters Campus Center''' is the newest building on campus. Finished in the fall of 2019, the building is named for alumna [[Barbara Walters]]. The building boasts a flexible multipurpose space which is used for dances, speeches, class gatherings, etc. On the second floor is the Barbara Walters Reading Room. It includes a rotating exhibition, but currently holds artifacts from Barbara Walters' life. The building has a green roof energy efficient LED lighting.\n* '''Bates Center for Student Life''' is one of the original campus buildings. A huge facility designed in the English Tudor style that is common in the area, it has housed not just offices and classrooms, but everything from maids\u2019 quarters to dining halls to laboratories and arts facilities. At one time, it was home to a miniature basketball court that is now a faculty dining room, though the lines of the court can still be seen on the floors. Over the years, programs in science, visual arts, and physical education have grown to the point that they have spilled over elsewhere on the campus, requiring three buildings of their own. Bates has always been home to the College's main dining facility and also houses the popular \"Health Food Bar.\"<ref>[http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/social/Bates_Center_for_Student_Life.html SLC Campus - Bates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204010051/http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/social/Bates_Center_for_Student_Life.html |date=2014-02-04 }}</ref>\n* '''The Esther Raushenbush Library''', designed in 1974 by Walter, Burns, Toan & Lundein an architectural style meant to interpret in a more modern and sleek fashion the implied buttresses and strong features of its much older neighbor, Andrews House.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=American Architecture - Westchester County, New York Colonial to Contemporary|author=Frank Sanchis|publisher=North River Press|date=1977|page=426}}</ref> The Raushenbush Library houses over 300,000 volumes.<ref>[http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/academic-arts/The_Esther_Raushenbush_Library.html SLC.edu - Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204005913/http://www.slc.edu/about/campus/academic-arts/The_Esther_Raushenbush_Library.html |date=2014-02-04 }}</ref>\n* '''The Alice Stone Ilchman Science and Mathematics Center''', completed in 1994, is situated on the far north end of the campus.

When the College began admitting male students in 1968, it became temporary housing for men. During the 1970s, the space was remodeled and christened \u201cThe Pub\u201d for use as an informal dining hall and as a space for student activities. During the 1980s, it was renamed \u201cCharlie\u2019s Place,\u201d honoring former President DeCarlo. In 1998, the entire structure was renovated, an addition was built by the architects [[Buttrick White & Burtis]], and the new complex took on its current official name.

After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect [[Philip Johnson]] in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a caf\u00e9 selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it is a fact that the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, there seems to be no evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member [[Joseph Campbell]].\n\n====Administration buildings====\n* '''Andrews Annex''', built in the 1990s adjacent to Andrews House, houses a number of administrative offices.\n* '''Lyles House''' is home to the College's Health Services Center.\n* '''The President's House''', built in 1921 and designed by architect Louis Bowman of [[McKim, Mead & White]], is an example of 16th century Tudor-style architecture.

Additionally, above the mantel a [[Genesis creation narrative|Christian creation story]] is told in intricate wood carving. Campus legend dictates that a secret panel exists in the living room leading to a wine cellar, which was built during [[Prohibition]].

The building currently houses various graduate-level programs.\n\n====Housing====\n* '''Andrews House''', a former manor house purchased for $200,000 by the college in 1935 from Arthur Lawrence, a son of the College's founders, is known for its high ceilings, fireplaces, and its spiraling main staircase.  The house is designed in the Germantown Colonial Style by architect Penrose Scott.  The majority of the building houses students, but it is also the home of the college's Department of Operations and Facilities and to the offices of Writing faculty.\n* '''Andrews Court''' refers to the twelve cottage-style buildings to the south of Andrews House.  Built in 1974, the buildings have, on average, about eight units each in addition to full kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* '''Tweed''', a former manor house, is home to a number of large dorm rooms in addition to a pair of classrooms.\n* '''Curtis''' is home to a number of dorms, and is also part of the Early Childhood Education complex.\n* '''Lynd House''', another former mansion, is home to mostly living spaces. The building's adjacent carriage house has been converted into student housing.\n* '''Hill House''', bought by the college in the late 1990s, is a seven-story apartment building on the extreme southern end of the campus. At present, the majority of the apartments in the building are occupied by students, but a number of them remain in the possession of the original tenants who occupied them when the building was purchased by Sarah Lawrence. Most of the apartments are quite large and each has a full kitchen. Apartments on the upper floors with south-facing windows have, on clear days, a view of the [[Empire State Building]].\n* '''Kober''' is home to dorm rooms, but is also a part of the Early Childhood Education complex.  It was donated to the college in 1951 by Otto Frohnknecht in memory of his daughter, Margaret Frohnknecht Kober, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1935.  There was once a [[bowling alley]] in its basement.\n* '''Morrill''' is the former maid's quarters to the President's House, and now is home to faculty offices.\n* '''Slonim House''' was formerly a manor house that is now occupied by dorms and by the college's Center for Continuing Education and Office of Graduate Studies.\n* '''Slonim Woods''' is the group of 10 purpose-built living facilities constructed in 1977. They consist of eight single person dorm rooms arranged around a central communal living space.\n\n=====Old dorms=====\nThe \"Old dorms\" refer to four original purpose-built student housing structures to the immediate north of Westlands in what is frequently referred to as the \"central campus\". Dudley Lawrence, one of the sons of William and Sarah Lawrence, achieved the remarkable feat of constructing three of these buildings in one year (1926\u20131927). The halls were designed by [[William Augustus Bates]], who repeated the Neo-Tudor style of Westlands through the use of stone and timber materials, and mansard roofs.  The interiors are also in keeping with the English Tudor architectural style found on most of the older buildings in the area, with thick plaster walls, hardwood floors, and leaded windows (since replaced with more energy-efficient double-pane windows). MacCracken, built a few years later than the other three, is situated to the south of Dudley Lawrence. The original elegant living rooms that were found in each building, excepting MacCracken, are now used as classrooms.<ref>[http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&d=p1506 Central Campus - \"old dorms\" - Historic Campus Architecture Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727204303/http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&d=p1506 |date=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n* '''Dudley Lawrence''', houses two classrooms in addition to living spaces.
