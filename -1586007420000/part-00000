In order to cheer up the [[ghost]] of [[Marie Antoinette]], who is upset about having been [[decapitation|beheaded]], the ghost of the [[playwright]] Beaumarchais stages an opera (obviously based on ''La M\u00e8re coupable'', although described by Beaumarchais as a new composition) using the characters and situations from his first two [[Pierre Beaumarchais#The Figaro plays|Figaro plays]].\n\nIn this new [[play-within-a-play|opera-within-an-opera]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Count Almaviva]] is in Paris as [[ambassador]] from Spain. Together with his trusty manservant Figaro, he tries to rescue [[Marie Antoinette]] from the [[French Revolution]]. When things go awry, Beaumarchais himself enters the opera and &ndash; with the invaluable help of Figaro and his wife Susanna &ndash; attempts to rescue the queen.\n\n===Act 1===\nThe ghosts of the court of Louis XVI arrive at the theatre of Versailles. Bored and listless, even the King is uninterested when Beaumarchais arrives and declares his love for the Queen. As Marie Antoinette is too haunted by her execution to reciprocate his love, Beaumarchais announces his intention to change her fate through the plot of his new opera ''A Figaro for Antonia''.\n\nThe cast of the opera-within-the-opera is introduced. It is twenty years after the events of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]''. Figaro appears, chased by his wife Susanna, his employer Count Almaviva, his many creditors and quite a lot of women claiming he is the father of their children. Figaro, now aging but still as wily and clever as ever, lists his many achievements in a lengthy aria. Meanwhile, Count Almaviva is engaged in a secret plan to sell Marie Antoinette's jeweled necklace{{efn|See also: [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]}} to the English ambassador to buy the Queen's freedom. The Count, Beaumarchais explains, is estranged from his wife Rosina due to her affair, years earlier with Cherubino. Though Cherubino is now dead, Rosina bore him a son, L\u00e9on. L\u00e9on wants to marry Florestine, Almaviva's illegitimate daughter (by a lady of the Court well-known to Marie Antoinette, according to Beaumarchais), but the Count has forbidden the union as retribution for his wife's infidelity and has promised Florestine instead to his friend Patrick Honor\u00e9 B\u00e9gearss.{{efn|For that name, see [[Nicolas Bergasse]]}}\n\nFigaro and Susanna enrage the Count by warning him that the trusted B\u00e9gearss is in fact a revolutionary spy. Figaro is fired, but overhears B\u00e9gearss and his dimwitted servant Wilhelm hatching a plot to arrest the Count that evening at the Turkish embassy when he sells the Queen's necklace to the English ambassador.\n\nThe Queen is still depressed, and Beaumarchais explains his intentions: Figaro will thwart the villains, the young lovers will be allowed to marry, and she herself will be freed and put on a ship bound for the New World, where he, Beaumarchais, will be waiting to entertain her. The King takes offense at this.\n\nThe Countess pleads with the Count on L\u00e9on's and Florestine's behalf, \"aided\" hypocritically (and therefore uselessly) by B\u00e9gearss, but the Count spurns her. Beaumarchais then enchants the Queen with a flashback, twenty years earlier, to Rosina's affair with Cherubino. In a beautiful garden, the lovers sing a rapturous duet, echoed by Beaumarchais and Marie Antoinette, who nearly kiss. They are interrupted by the King, who, enraged, challenges Beaumarchais to a duel. After a brief bit of swordplay, the King runs Beaumarchais through, but the wound has no effect because they are all already dead. The Ghosts find this hilarious, and have great fun stabbing each other.\n\nBeaumarchais changes the scene to the Turkish embassy, to a wild party thrown by the Turkish ambassador Suleyman Pasha. B\u00e9gearss readies his men to arrest the Count, but Figaro intercepts the plot by infiltrating the party dressed as a dancing girl. During the outrageous performance of the Turkish singer Samira, Figaro steals the necklace from the Count before the sale can take place and runs away, hotly pursued by everybody else.\n\n===Act 2===\nBeaumarchais sets up the beginning of the second act. Figaro returns, but to Beaumarchais' shock and the amusement of the Ghosts defies Beaumarchais's intention that he return the necklace to the queen, as he wants to sell it to help the Almavivas escape. To put the story back on course and despite the danger to himself, Beaumarchais enters the opera and shocks Figaro into submission by forcing him to witness the unfair trial of Marie.\n\nThe Count, swayed by his wife's wishes, rescinds his offer to B\u00e9gearss of his daughter's hand. Even though Figaro gives him the necklace, B\u00e9gearss is enraged and sends the Spaniards to the prison where Marie Antoinette lingers. Because of his entering the opera, Beaumarchais' powers are gone and he is weakened and unable to prevent the arrest, but he and Figaro manage to escape.\n\nIn prison, the Count realizes his foolishness and becomes reconciled with his wife, Florestine and L\u00e9on. Beaumarchais and Figaro arrive at the prison to try to rescue the Almavivas, but it is the Countess, Susanna and Florestine who come up with a plan: using their feminine wiles on poor Wilhelm, who is their jailer, they steal his keys, unlock their cell and, after locking him inside, attempt to flee. B\u00e9gearss and soldiers appear to prevent their escape with the Queen, and B\u00e9gearss viciously announces that Wilhelm will be executed as well for his failure. Figaro denounces B\u00e9gearss to the revolutionaries, revealing that he has kept the necklace rather than using it to feed the poor, and is backed up by Wilhelm. B\u00e9gearss is arrested as a traitor to the Revolution and dragged off, the Almavivas leave and Beaumarchais, after bidding a fond farewell to his favorite creation (i.e. Figaro), is left with the keys to the Queen's cell and proceeds to complete his plan. But the Queen refuses to let Beaumarchais alter the course of history; the power of his love has helped her to accept her fate and he has, in fact, freed her from her own fear and grief which have kept her as a ghost on Earth and she is now free to declare her own love for Beaumarchais. Events proceed: the Queen is executed; Figaro, Susanna and the Almavivas escape to America; and Marie Antoinette and Beaumarchais are united in Paradise.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2015, Richard S. Ginell of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \u201cmany still differ as to whether \u2018Ghosts\u2019 has lived up to the hype and expense of its 1991 premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. But I love it, and I think it has a shot at immortality. It\u2019s comic and serious, entertaining and erudite, silly and thoughtful, emotional and mysterious, harrowing and uplifting, intimate and over-the-top \u2014 and the more times you see it, the more you\u2019ll find in it and the more you\u2019ll get out of it.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-ghosts-versailles-review-20150209-story.html|title=Opera 'Ghosts of Versailles' may live forever|last=Ginell|first=Richard S.|date=2015-02-09|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nUp until recently, the only recordings were a VHS of a televised production presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1992 and a Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) LaserDisc of the same performance.

As Marie Antoinette is too haunted by her execution to reciprocate his love, Beaumarchais announces his intention to change her fate through the plot of his new opera ''A Figaro for Antonia''.\n\nThe cast of the opera-within-the-opera is introduced. It is twenty years after the events of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]''. Figaro appears, chased by his wife Susanna, his employer Count Almaviva, his many creditors and quite a lot of women claiming he is the father of their children. Figaro, now aging but still as wily and clever as ever, lists his many achievements in a lengthy aria. Meanwhile, Count Almaviva is engaged in a secret plan to sell Marie Antoinette's jeweled necklace{{efn|See also: [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]}} to the English ambassador to buy the Queen's freedom. The Count, Beaumarchais explains, is estranged from his wife Rosina due to her affair, years earlier with Cherubino. Though Cherubino is now dead, Rosina bore him a son, L\u00e9on. L\u00e9on wants to marry Florestine, Almaviva's illegitimate daughter (by a lady of the Court well-known to Marie Antoinette, according to Beaumarchais), but the Count has forbidden the union as retribution for his wife's infidelity and has promised Florestine instead to his friend Patrick Honor\u00e9 B\u00e9gearss.{{efn|For that name, see [[Nicolas Bergasse]]}}\n\nFigaro and Susanna enrage the Count by warning him that the trusted B\u00e9gearss is in fact a revolutionary spy. Figaro is fired, but overhears B\u00e9gearss and his dimwitted servant Wilhelm hatching a plot to arrest the Count that evening at the Turkish embassy when he sells the Queen's necklace to the English ambassador.\n\nThe Queen is still depressed, and Beaumarchais explains his intentions: Figaro will thwart the villains, the young lovers will be allowed to marry, and she herself will be freed and put on a ship bound for the New World, where he, Beaumarchais, will be waiting to entertain her. The King takes offense at this.\n\nThe Countess pleads with the Count on L\u00e9on's and Florestine's behalf, \"aided\" hypocritically (and therefore uselessly) by B\u00e9gearss, but the Count spurns her. Beaumarchais then enchants the Queen with a flashback, twenty years earlier, to Rosina's affair with Cherubino. In a beautiful garden, the lovers sing a rapturous duet, echoed by Beaumarchais and Marie Antoinette, who nearly kiss. They are interrupted by the King, who, enraged, challenges Beaumarchais to a duel. After a brief bit of swordplay, the King runs Beaumarchais through, but the wound has no effect because they are all already dead. The Ghosts find this hilarious, and have great fun stabbing each other.\n\nBeaumarchais changes the scene to the Turkish embassy, to a wild party thrown by the Turkish ambassador Suleyman Pasha. B\u00e9gearss readies his men to arrest the Count, but Figaro intercepts the plot by infiltrating the party dressed as a dancing girl. During the outrageous performance of the Turkish singer Samira, Figaro steals the necklace from the Count before the sale can take place and runs away, hotly pursued by everybody else.\n\n===Act 2===\nBeaumarchais sets up the beginning of the second act. Figaro returns, but to Beaumarchais' shock and the amusement of the Ghosts defies Beaumarchais's intention that he return the necklace to the queen, as he wants to sell it to help the Almavivas escape. To put the story back on course and despite the danger to himself, Beaumarchais enters the opera and shocks Figaro into submission by forcing him to witness the unfair trial of Marie.\n\nThe Count, swayed by his wife's wishes, rescinds his offer to B\u00e9gearss of his daughter's hand. Even though Figaro gives him the necklace, B\u00e9gearss is enraged and sends the Spaniards to the prison where Marie Antoinette lingers. Because of his entering the opera, Beaumarchais' powers are gone and he is weakened and unable to prevent the arrest, but he and Figaro manage to escape.\n\nIn prison, the Count realizes his foolishness and becomes reconciled with his wife, Florestine and L\u00e9on. Beaumarchais and Figaro arrive at the prison to try to rescue the Almavivas, but it is the Countess, Susanna and Florestine who come up with a plan: using their feminine wiles on poor Wilhelm, who is their jailer, they steal his keys, unlock their cell and, after locking him inside, attempt to flee. B\u00e9gearss and soldiers appear to prevent their escape with the Queen, and B\u00e9gearss viciously announces that Wilhelm will be executed as well for his failure. Figaro denounces B\u00e9gearss to the revolutionaries, revealing that he has kept the necklace rather than using it to feed the poor, and is backed up by Wilhelm. B\u00e9gearss is arrested as a traitor to the Revolution and dragged off, the Almavivas leave and Beaumarchais, after bidding a fond farewell to his favorite creation (i.e. Figaro), is left with the keys to the Queen's cell and proceeds to complete his plan. But the Queen refuses to let Beaumarchais alter the course of history; the power of his love has helped her to accept her fate and he has, in fact, freed her from her own fear and grief which have kept her as a ghost on Earth and she is now free to declare her own love for Beaumarchais. Events proceed: the Queen is executed; Figaro, Susanna and the Almavivas escape to America; and Marie Antoinette and Beaumarchais are united in Paradise.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2015, Richard S. Ginell of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \u201cmany still differ as to whether \u2018Ghosts\u2019 has lived up to the hype and expense of its 1991 premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. But I love it, and I think it has a shot at immortality. It\u2019s comic and serious, entertaining and erudite, silly and thoughtful, emotional and mysterious, harrowing and uplifting, intimate and over-the-top \u2013 and the more times you see it, the more you\u2019ll find in it and the more you\u2019ll get out of it.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-ghosts-versailles-review-20150209-story.html|title=Opera 'Ghosts of Versailles' may live forever|last=Ginell|first=Richard S.|date=2015-02-09|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nUp until recently, the only recordings were a VHS of a televised production presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1992 and a Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) LaserDisc of the same performance.

He returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence so that he can take part in a tryout with a semi-pro team, and decides to stay and help his father and older brother on their family ranch. Colt is frequently the butt of their jokes, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career.  He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the [[Barcelona Dragons]], [[San Jose SaberCats]], [[Spokane Shock]], [[Orlando Predators]], [[Nebraska Danger]], [[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]], [[Minnesota Axemen]], [[Portland Forest Dragons]] and [[Philadelphia Soul]]. Dialogue and team gear also indicates that he was a member of teams in [[Canada]], notably the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] and fictional [[Saskatoon]] Cold (\"Like the [[Miami Heat]]... only cold\").  He has also played on teams in [[Alaska]] and was a member of the [[Buffalo Bills]] practice squad. In the first episode of the series, Colt reveals that he was \"the back up to the back up to the back up\" for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] team that won the [[Bowl Championship Series|college football championship]] in 1999. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for having to accept the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has, however, been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. In the first half of Season 3, Rooster gets into hot water with Mary's intimidating boyfriend, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau, her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning their father. Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker.\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is difficult to get along with, perpetually annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He detests many modern amenities and is easily angered by his sons' antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a special affinity for [[Ronald Reagan]] but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny and ultimately marries Colt, having a baby girl, Peyton, down the line.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Dale Rivers, a hearing-impaired veterinarian and close friend of Beau's\n* Grady Lee Richmond as Hank, a regular Maggie's patron\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Kenny Ballard, a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] manager and Abby's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Megyn Price]] as Mary Roth, a [[Cracker Barrel]] waitress and Rooster's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Kelli Goss]] as Heather Roth, Mary's younger daughter and Colt's ex-girlfriend, was pregnant with their child.\n* [[Molly McCook]] as Darlene Roth, Mary's older daughter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joanne, Beau's girlfriend and Mary's friend/coworker at the Cracker Barrel\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as \"Beer Pong\" Billy Tompkins, a police officer and high school friend of Colt and Rooster's.\n* Justin Mooney as Officer Wilkerson\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Nikki, Heather's friend and Billy's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Chasty Ballesteros]] as Tanya Showers, a sexy weather reporter and Kenny's current girlfriend\n* Laura Vallejo as Maria, a Maggie's waitress\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Brenda Sanders, a widowed hairdresser who befriended Beau when he and Maggie separated\n* [[Maggie Lawson]] as Jen, an engineer who wants to build a pipeline underneath the Bennett Ranch and Rooster's love interest\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Lisa Neumann, owner of the Neumann's Hill ranching corporation\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Luke Matthews, the son of Beau's late brother Greg\n* [[Stephen Saux]] as Mike, a motel manager, first seen at the Thomas Rhett concert\n* Travis Case as Toby, Colt's high school classmate, who runs the neighboring Henderson Ranch\n*Josh Burrow as Nick, Mary\u2019s intimidating and abusive ex boyfriend, who runs Rooster out of town at gun point.

Colt learns that Beau is having a hard time managing the ranch because of an extensive drought and having only Rooster to help.

Kenny asks Colt to give a speech at the Garrison High School football team's annual dinner.  Colt meets Garrison's new quarterback and coach, but his egotistical storytelling earns him their him disrespect. Beau visits the doctor, who disproves his claim of feeling no pain by leaving a prescription on the floor for him to pick up.  The doctor diagnoses Beau with high blood pressure and advises him to cut back on alcohol and red meat.

He returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence so that he can take part in a tryout with a semi-pro team, and decides to stay and help his father and older brother on their family ranch. Colt is frequently the butt of their jokes, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career.  He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the [[Barcelona Dragons]], [[San Jose SaberCats]], [[Spokane Shock]], [[Orlando Predators]], [[Nebraska Danger]], [[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]], [[Minnesota Axemen]], [[Portland Forest Dragons]] and [[Philadelphia Soul]]. Dialogue and team gear also indicates that he was a member of teams in [[Canada]], notably the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] and fictional [[Saskatoon]] Cold (\"Like the [[Miami Heat]]... only cold\").  He has also played on teams in [[Alaska]] and was a member of the [[Buffalo Bills]] practice squad. In the first episode of the series, Colt reveals that he was \"the back up to the back up to the back up\" for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] team that won the [[Bowl Championship Series|college football championship]] in 1999. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for having to accept the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has, however, been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. In the first half of Season 3, Rooster gets into hot water with Mary's intimidating boyfriend, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau, her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning their father. Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker.\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is difficult to get along with, perpetually annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He detests many modern amenities and is easily angered by his sons' antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a special affinity for [[Ronald Reagan]] but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny and ultimately marries Colt, having a baby girl, Peyton, down the line.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Dale Rivers, a hearing-impaired veterinarian and close friend of Beau's\n* Grady Lee Richmond as Hank, a regular Maggie's patron\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Kenny Ballard, a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] manager and Abby's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Megyn Price]] as Mary Roth, a [[Cracker Barrel]] waitress and Rooster's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Kelli Goss]] as Heather Roth, Mary's younger daughter and Colt's ex-girlfriend, was pregnant with their child.\n* [[Molly McCook]] as Darlene Roth, Mary's older daughter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joanne, Beau's girlfriend and Mary's friend/coworker at the Cracker Barrel\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as \"Beer Pong\" Billy Tompkins, a police officer and high school friend of Colt and Rooster's.\n* Justin Mooney as Officer Wilkerson\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Nikki, Heather's friend and Billy's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Chasty Ballesteros]] as Tanya Showers, a sexy weather reporter and Kenny's current girlfriend\n* Laura Vallejo as Maria, a Maggie's waitress\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Brenda Sanders, a widowed hairdresser who befriended Beau when he and Maggie separated\n* [[Maggie Lawson]] as Jen, an engineer who wants to build a pipeline underneath the Bennett Ranch and Rooster's love interest\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Lisa Neumann, owner of the Neumann's Hill ranching corporation\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Luke Matthews, the son of Beau's late brother Greg\n* [[Stephen Saux]] as Mike, a motel manager, first seen at the Thomas Rhett concert\n* Travis Case as Toby, Colt's high school classmate, who runs the neighboring Henderson Ranch\n*Josh Burrow as Nick, Mary\u2019s intimidating and abusive ex boyfriend, who runs Rooster out of town at gun point.

Colt learns that Beau is having a hard time managing the ranch because of an extensive drought and having only Rooster to help.

Kenny asks Colt to give a speech at the Garrison High School football team's annual dinner.  Colt meets Garrison's new quarterback and coach, but his egotistical storytelling earns him their him disrespect. Beau visits the doctor, who disproves his claim of feeling no pain by leaving a prescription on the floor for him to pick up.  The doctor diagnoses Beau with high blood pressure and advises him to cut back on alcohol and red meat.

It was a change in direction from his first two albums, the lyrical theme moving away from the stories about [[working class]] Britain and instead focusing on the ups and downs of the fame that Skinner encountered after the success of his previous albums.\n\nThe first single, \"[[When You Wasn't Famous]]\", was released two weeks before the album. The song is about Skinner's troubles with trying to date a famous person, following his new-found fame. It was also named 'Track of the Week' by ''NME'' in early March 2006.\n\nSkinner disclosed in his memoirs that the track is not about his relationship with Rachel Stevens and that she was not the pop star who smoked crack.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Streets life: stories from Mike Skinner about the Birmingham garage project |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/25/street-life-mike-skinner-memoir |accessdate=26 March 2012 |work=[[The Observer]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325152335/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/25/street-life-mike-skinner-memoir |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe second single, \"[[Never Went to Church]]\", is a tribute to Skinner's late father, and appears to use the chord progression of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" as a backing.

It was a breakthrough hit for The Streets, reaching number 18 on the UK charts in October 2001.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nFor The Streets' first album, ''[[Original Pirate Material]]'', Skinner wanted to take UK garage in a new direction with material reflecting the lifestyle of clubbers in Britain.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The track \"[[Let's Push Things Forward]]\" reflects the philosophy of the album.

In the UK it entered the album chart at number one. It was a change in direction from his first two albums, the lyrical theme moving away from the stories about [[working class]] Britain and instead focusing on the ups and downs of the fame that Skinner encountered after the success of his previous albums.\n\nThe first single, \"[[When You Wasn't Famous]]\", was released two weeks before the album. The song is about Skinner's troubles with trying to date a famous person, following his new-found fame. It was also named 'Track of the Week' by ''NME'' in early March 2006.\n\nSkinner disclosed in his memoirs that the track is not about his relationship with Rachel Stevens and that she was not the pop star who smoked crack.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Streets life: stories from Mike Skinner about the Birmingham garage project |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/25/street-life-mike-skinner-memoir |accessdate=26 March 2012 |work=[[The Observer]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325152335/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/25/street-life-mike-skinner-memoir |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe second single, \"[[Never Went to Church]]\", is a tribute to Skinner's late father, and appears to use the chord progression of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" as a backing.

In a posting on his Myspace blog, Skinner noted that the group's upcoming LP would contain \"peaceful, positive vibes\" in comparison with 2006's ''The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living''.\n\nIn a blurb about the album on Skinner's Myspace, he says, \"This album started off life as parables but then I realised that it might get a bit cheesy so I got rid of the alien song and the devil song replaced them with more straight up songs. I've pretty much kept my promise that I made to myself not to reference modern life on any of them though which is hard to do and keep things personal at the same time.\"\n\nOn 1 January 2009, the [[compilation album]] ''[[Original Bootleg Material]]'' was released.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

After Gaddafi loyalists gained the upper hand the air strikes intensified in what some interpreted as a move towards [[Decapitation strike|decapitation strikes]] while France, Italy, and the United Kingdom sent [[Military advisor|military advisors]] to the National Transitional Council. Eventually the TNC gained the upper hand in the conflict, captured the [[capital city]] of [[Tripoli]], and achieved [[diplomatic recognition]] from the United Nations. Gaddafi was forced to flee and was killed by rebels in [[Sirte]]. \n| rowspan=\"5\" |<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HFUZBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA191&dq=20+October+2011+Gaddafi&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw5NGRhoriAhUBt4sKHXJfDewQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=20%20October%202011%20Gaddafi&f=false|title=The Violence of the Image: Photography and International Conflict|last=Allan|first=Stuart|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2014|isbn=9781780767895|editor-last=Kennedy|editor-first=Liam|location=London and New York|pages=178\u2013180|language=en|chapter=Photo-Reportage of the Libyan Conflict|editor-last2=Patrick|editor-first2=Caitlin}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWelS5J5OYAC&dq=qaddafi+2011|title=Libya: The Rise and Fall of Qaddafi|last=Pargeter|first=Alison|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780300139327|location=Padstow, UK|pages=213\u2013247|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Libya-Revolt-of-2011|title=Libya Revolt of 2011|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Jordan}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[2011 military intervention in Libya]]\n|-\n|{{Flag|Qatar}}\n|-\n|{{Flag|Sweden}}\n|-\n|{{Flag|United Arab Emirates}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[Yahya Jammeh]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" |{{flag|Gambia}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[President of Gambia]]\n|{{flag|Senegal}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" |21 January 2017\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[2017 ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia|ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[Adama Barrow]] had won the [[2016 Gambian presidential election]], but Jammeh had refused to step down. \n| rowspan=\"5\" |<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EU9WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA913&dq=Yahya+Jammeh+2017#v=onepage&q=Yahya%20Jammeh%202017&f=false|title=The Use of Force in International Law: A Case-based Approach|last=Helal|first=Mohamed S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198784357|editor-last=Ruys|editor-first=Tom|location=Oxford and New York|pages=912\u2013930|language=en|editor-last2=Corten|editor-first2=Olivier|editor-last3=Hofer|editor-first3=Alexandra}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{flag|Nigeria}}\n|-\n|{{flag|Ghana}}\n|-\n|{{flag|Mali}}\n|-\n|{{flag|Togo}}\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Changes in political power]]\n[[Category:Lists of military operations]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Lists of heads of state]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a list of heads of state and governments deposed by a foreign power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VhPF-DstSKsC&pg=PA443&dq=Raoul+C%C3%A9dras+1994#v=onepage&q=Raoul%20C%C3%A9dras%201994&f=false|title=The Presidents Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity|last=Gibbs|first=Nancy|last2=Duffy|first2=Michael|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2012|isbn=9781439127704|location=New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, nNew Delhi|pages=443\u2013448|language=en}}\n</ref> The list is chronological.\n\n== List ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Head of State or Government \n!Country\n!Title\n!The deposed by\n!Date\n!Operation\n!Notes\n!Ref\n|-\n|[[Emilio Aguinaldo]]\n|{{Flag|First Philippine Republic|name=Philippines}}\n|[[President of Philippines]]\n|{{Flag|United States|1896}}\n|23 March 1901\n|[[Philippine-American War]]\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC&pg=PA229&dq=Emilio+Aguinaldo+1901#v=onepage&q=Emilio%20Aguinaldo%201901&f=false|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|last=Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|publisher=University of North Carolina Press Books|year=2000|isbn=9780807849484|location=Chapel Hill, NC and London|pages=26|language=en|orig-year=1989}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Paul Kruger]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flag|South African Republic}}\n|[[State President of the South African Republic]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |{{Flag|United Kingdom}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |31 May 1902\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Second Boer War]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |The Orange Free State and the South African Republic were forced to surrender their sovereignty in the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] to become colonies of the [[British Empire]], but were promised an [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] [[Civil authority|civilian government]], and the colonies later merged with [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] to form the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.

Hassium is highly [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>269</sup>Hs, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 16&nbsp;seconds. One of its isotopes, <sup>270</sup>Hs, has [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] of both [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s for deformed nuclei, which gives it greater stability against [[spontaneous fission]]. Hassium [[synthetic element|has been made only in laboratories]] in minuscule quantities; its possible occurrence in nature has been hypothesized but no natural hassium has been found so far.\n\nThe first attempts to synthesize element&nbsp;108 were made in two different experiments at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], in 1978. More attempts were made at the same venue in 1983 and then in 1984; the latter resulted in a claim that element&nbsp;108 had been produced. Later in 1984, an attempt was made at the [[Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], [[West Germany]], which claimed to have synthesized it. The 1993 report by the Transfermium Working Group, formed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], concluded the report from Darmstadt was more conclusive on its own and the major credit was assigned to the German scientists, who then chose the name ''hassium'' after the German state of Hesse.\n\nIn the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of elements, hassium is a [[transactinide element]], a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and [[group 8 elements|group 8]]; it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[osmium]], in group 8, reacting readily with oxygen to form a volatile [[tetroxide]]. The chemical properties of hassium have only been partly characterized but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements.\n\n==Introduction==\n{{:Superheavy element/Short introduction}}\n\n==Discovery==\n{{see also|Discovery of the chemical elements}}\n\n=== Discoverers of transuranium elements prior to element 108 ===\n{{see also|Timeline of chemical element discoveries}}\n\n[[File:Apparatus for creation of superheavy elements en.svg|alt=Apparatus for creation of superheavy elements|right|thumb|upright=2.00|Scheme of an apparatus for creation of superheavy elements, based on the Dubna Gas-Filled Recoil Separator set up in the [[Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions]] in JINR.

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atomic nucleus. Such a number constitutes an exhaustive definition of an element, so an element can be referred to by its atomic number; for example, uranium is element&nbsp;92. All elements with atomic number above 92 were discovered by synthesis rather than by observation in nature. The first such element, element&nbsp;93, later named [[neptunium]], was discovered in 1940 at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], United States.{{sfn|Hoffman|2000|pp=28\u201329}}{{efn|Neptunium was discovered after bombardment of uranium with singular neutrons; the reaction did not produce neptunium, but it created an isotope of uranium that decayed to it. This reaction does not necessitate formation of a temporary compound nucleus and is referred to as a direct reaction as opposed to the previously described compound nucleus reactions. The two are differentiated by the number of interactions: it is equal to one for direct reactions and is greater (usually, significantly) than one for compound nucleus reactions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web-docs.gsi.de/~wolle/TELEKOLLEG/KERN/LECTURE/Fraser/L24.pdf|title=Direct and compound nucleus reaction|date=2011|work=NUSC 342 - Introduction to Nuclear Science|author=Simon Fraser University|access-date=2020-01-31|author-link=Simon Fraser University}}</ref> Such production is possible for all elements up to fermium.{{sfn|Hoffman|2000|p=192}}}} Elements through [[mendelevium|101]] were discovered at this university's Radiation Laboratory (RL; later named Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, LBL, and now [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], LBNL).

While this increased the chance of fusion due to the lower electrostatic repulsion between the target and the projectile, the formed compound nuclei often broke apart and did not survive to form a new element. Moreover, fusion processes inevitably produce neutron-poor nuclei, as heavier elements require more neutrons per proton to maximize stability;{{efn|Generally, heavier nuclei require more neutrons because as the number of protons increases, so does electrostatic repulsion between them. This repulsion is balanced by the strong interaction between quarks within nucleons; it is enough to hold the quarks together in a nucleon together and some of it is left for binding of different nucleons. The more nucleons there are in a nucleus, the more energy there is for binding the nucleons.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019 |url=https://inchemistry.acs.org/content/inchemistry/en/atomic-news/modern-alchemy-creating-superheavy-elements.html |title=Modern Alchemy: Creating Superheavy Elements |website=[[inChemistry]] |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |language=en |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> However, having too many neutrons per proton results in beta decay.|name=|group=}} therefore, the necessary ejection of neutrons results in final products with typically have shorter [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|lifetimes]].

The nuclear shell model describes this as a consequence of closed \"shells\" of protons and neutrons, whose closures create especially stable configurations. The highest known magic numbers are 82 for protons and 126 for neutrons. This notion is sometimes expanded to include additional numbers between those magic numbers, which also provide some additional stability and indicate closure of \"sub-shells\". There are various predictions for higher magic numbers; the next [[doubly magic]] nucleus (having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons) is expected to lie in the center of the \"island of stability\", which is theorized to contain longer-lived superheavy nuclides in the vicinity of ''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;110\u2013114 and the predicted magic [[neutron number]] ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;184. In 1997, Polish physicist [[Robert Smola\u0144czuk]] calculated that the isotope <sup>292</sup>Hs may be the most stable superheavy nucleus against alpha decay and spontaneous fission as a consequence of the predicted ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;184 shell closure.<ref name=\"KarpovSHE\">{{cite journal|last=Karpov|first=A.

Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium; as is the case for all 6d metals, a few deviations are expected to arise from [[relativistic effects]].{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|pp=1666\u20131669}}\n\nVery few properties of hassium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production<ref name=Bloomberg/> and the fact that hassium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, such as enthalpy of adsorption of hassium tetroxide, but properties of hassium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\n\n===Relativistic effects===\n{{main|Relativistic quantum chemistry}}\n\n[[File:Energy levels of outermost orbitals of Hs and Os.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.50|alt=Energy levels of outermost orbitals of Hs and Os|Energy levels of outermost orbitals of hassium and osmium atoms in [[electronvolt]]s, with and without taking in account relativistic effects. Note the lack of [[spin\u2013orbit splitting]] (and thus distinction between d<sub>3/2</sub> and d<sub>5/2</sub> orbitals) in nonrelativistic calculations.]]\n\n[[Relativistic quantum chemistry|Relativistic effects]] on hassium should arise due to the high change of its nuclei, which causes the electrons around the nucleus to move faster\u2014so fast their velocity becomes comparable to the speed of light.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1666}} There are three main effects: the direct relativistic effect, the indirect relativistic effect, and the [[spin\u2013orbit splitting]]. (The existing calculations do not account for [[Breit equation|Breit interactions]], but those are negligible, and their omission can only result in an uncertainty of the current calculations of no more than 2%.){{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1669}}\n\nAs atomic number increases, so does the electrostatic attraction between an electron and the nucleus. This causes the velocity of the electron to increase, which leads to an increase its [[Mass in special relativity|mass]]. This in turn increases the [[Gravity|gravitational]] attraction between the electron and the nucleus, which leads to contraction of the [[atomic orbital]]s, most specifically the s and p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals. Their electrons become more closely attached to the atom and harder to pull from the nucleus. This is the direct relativistic effect.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|pp=1666\u20131667}}\n\nSince the s and p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals are closer to the nucleus, they take a bigger portion of the electric charge of the nucleus on themselves (\"shield\" it). This leaves less charge for attraction of the remaining electrons, whose orbitals therefore expand, making them easier to pull from the nucleus. This is the indirect relativistic effect.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1667\u20131668}} The combination of the two leads to that the Hs<sup>+</sup> ion, compared to the neutral atom, lacks a 6d electron, rather than a 7s electron. In comparison, Os<sup>+</sup> lacks a 6s electron compared to the neutral atom.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1672}} The ionic radius (in oxidation state +8) of hassium is greater than that of osmium because of the relativistic expansion of the 6p<sub>3/2</sub> orbitals, which are the outermost orbitals for a hassium ion.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1676}}\n\nThere are several kinds of electronic orbitals, denoted by the letters s, p, d, and f (g orbitals are expected to emerge among elements after [[unbinilium|element 120]]). Each of these corresponds to an [[azimuthal quantum number]] ''l'': s to 0, p to 1, d to 2, and f to 3. Every electron also corresponds to a [[spin quantum number]] ''s'', which may equal either +1/2 or \u22121/2.<ref name=\"SO splitting\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.xpsfitting.com/2012/08/spin-orbit-splitting.html|title=Spin Orbit Splitting|date=2012|website=X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Reference Pages|publisher=[[University of Western Ontario]]|url-status=live|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Thus, the [[total angular momentum quantum number]] ''j = l'' + ''s'' is equal to ''j'' = ''l'' \u00b1 1/2 (except for ''l'' = 0, for which for both electrons in each orbital ''j ='' 0 + 1/2 = 1/2).<ref name=\"SO splitting\"/> [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] of an electron [[spin\u2013orbit interaction|interacts]] with its orbit, which leads to a split of a subshell into two with different energies (the one with ''j'' = ''l'' \u2212 1/2 is lower in energy and thus these electrons more difficult to extract):<ref>{{cite book|last=Thayer|first=J.

Hassium is highly [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>269</sup>Hs, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 16&nbsp;seconds. One of its isotopes, <sup>270</sup>Hs, has [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] of both [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s for deformed nuclei, which gives it greater stability against [[spontaneous fission]]. Hassium [[synthetic element|has been made only in laboratories]] in minuscule quantities; its possible occurrence in nature has been hypothesized but no natural hassium has been found so far.\n\nThe first attempts to synthesize element&nbsp;108 were made in two different experiments at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], in 1978. More attempts were made at the same venue in 1983 and then in 1984; the latter resulted in a claim that element&nbsp;108 had been produced. Later in 1984, an attempt was made at the [[Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], [[West Germany]], which claimed to have synthesized it. The 1993 report by the Transfermium Working Group, formed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], concluded the report from Darmstadt was more conclusive on its own and the major credit was assigned to the German scientists, who then chose the name ''hassium'' after the German state of Hesse.\n\nIn the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of elements, hassium is a [[transactinide element]], a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and [[group 8 elements|group 8]]; it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[osmium]], in group 8, reacting readily with oxygen to form a volatile [[tetroxide]]. The chemical properties of hassium have only been partly characterized but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements.\n\n==Introduction==\n{{:Superheavy element/Short introduction}}\n\n==Discovery==\n{{see also|Discovery of the chemical elements}}\n\n=== Discoverers of transuranium elements prior to element 108 ===\n{{see also|Timeline of chemical element discoveries}}\n\n[[File:Apparatus for creation of superheavy elements en.svg|alt=Apparatus for creation of superheavy elements|right|thumb|upright=2.00|Scheme of an apparatus for creation of superheavy elements, based on the Dubna Gas-Filled Recoil Separator set up in the [[Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions]] in JINR.

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atomic nucleus. Such a number constitutes an exhaustive definition of an element, so an element can be referred to by its atomic number; for example, uranium is element&nbsp;92. All elements with atomic number above 92 were discovered by synthesis rather than by observation in nature. The first such element, element&nbsp;93, later named [[neptunium]], was discovered in 1940 at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], United States.{{sfn|Hoffman|2000|pp=28\u201329}}{{efn|Neptunium was discovered after bombardment of uranium with singular neutrons; the reaction did not produce neptunium, but it created an isotope of uranium that decayed to it. This reaction does not necessitate formation of a temporary compound nucleus and is referred to as a direct reaction as opposed to the previously described compound nucleus reactions. The two are differentiated by the number of interactions: it is equal to one for direct reactions and is greater (usually, significantly) than one for compound nucleus reactions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web-docs.gsi.de/~wolle/TELEKOLLEG/KERN/LECTURE/Fraser/L24.pdf|title=Direct and compound nucleus reaction|date=2011|work=NUSC 342 - Introduction to Nuclear Science|author=Simon Fraser University|access-date=2020-01-31|author-link=Simon Fraser University}}</ref> Such production is possible for all elements up to fermium.{{sfn|Hoffman|2000|p=192}}}} Elements through [[mendelevium|101]] were discovered at this university's Radiation Laboratory (RL; later named Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, LBL, and now [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], LBNL).

While this increased the chance of fusion due to the lower electrostatic repulsion between the target and the projectile, the formed compound nuclei often broke apart and did not survive to form a new element.

The report concluded that the major credit should be awarded to GSI.{{sfn|Barber|1993|p=1791}} In written responses to this ruling, both JINR and GSI agreed with its conclusions.

The nuclear shell model describes this as a consequence of closed \"shells\" of protons and neutrons, whose closures create especially stable configurations. The highest known magic numbers are 82 for protons and 126 for neutrons. This notion is sometimes expanded to include additional numbers between those magic numbers, which also provide some additional stability and indicate closure of \"sub-shells\". There are various predictions for higher magic numbers; the next [[doubly magic]] nucleus (having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons) is expected to lie in the center of the \"island of stability\", which is theorized to contain longer-lived superheavy nuclides in the vicinity of ''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;110\u2013114 and the predicted magic [[neutron number]] ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;184.

Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium; as is the case for all 6d metals, a few deviations are expected to arise from [[relativistic effects]].{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|pp=1666\u20131669}}\n\nVery few properties of hassium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production<ref name=Bloomberg/> and the fact that hassium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties properties have been measured, such as enthalpy of adsorption of hassium tetroxide, but properties of hassium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\n\n===Relativistic effects===\n{{main|Relativistic quantum chemistry}}\n\n[[File:Energy levels of outermost orbitals of Hs and Os.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.50|alt=Energy levels of outermost orbitals of Hs and Os|Energy levels of outermost orbitals of hassium and osmium atoms in [[electronvolt]]s, with and without taking in account relativistic effects. Note the lack of [[spin\u2013orbit splitting]] (and thus distinction between d<sub>3/2</sub> and d<sub>5/2</sub> orbitals) in nonrelativistic calculations.]]\n\n[[Relativistic quantum chemistry|Relativistic effects]] on hassium should arise due to the high change of its nuclei, which causes the electrons around the nucleus to move faster\u2014so fast their velocity becomes comparable to the speed of light.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1666}} There are three main effects: the direct relativistic effect, the indirect relativistic effect, and the [[spin\u2013orbit splitting]]. (The existing calculations do not account for [[Breit equation|Breit interactions]], but those are negligible, and their omission can only result in an uncertainty of the current calculations of no more than 2%.){{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1669}}\n\nAs atomic number increases, so does the electrostatic attraction between an electron and the nucleus. This causes the velocity of the electron to increase, which leads to an increase its [[Mass in special relativity|mass]]. This in turn increases the [[Gravity|gravitational]] attraction between the electron and the nucleus, which leads to contraction of the [[atomic orbital]]s, most specifically the s and p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals. Their electrons become more closely attached to the atom and harder to pull from the nucleus. This is the direct relativistic effect.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|pp=1666\u20131667}}\n\nSince the s and p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals are closer to the nucleus, they take a bigger portion of the electric charge of the nucleus on themselves (\"shield\" it). This leaves less charge for attraction of the remaining electrons, whose orbitals therefore expand, making them easier to pull from the nucleus. This is the indirect relativistic effect.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1667\u20131668}} The combination of the two leads to that the Hs<sup>+</sup> ion, compared to the neutral atom, lacks a 6d electron, rather than a 7s electron. In comparison, Os<sup>+</sup> lacks a 6s electron compared to the neutral atom.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1672}} The ionic radius (in oxidation state +8) of hassium is greater than that of osmium because of the relativistic expansion of the 6p<sub>3/2</sub> orbitals, which are the outermost orbitals for a hassium ion.{{sfn|Hoffman|2006|p=1676}}\n\nThere are several kinds of electronic orbitals, denoted by the letters s, p, d, and f (g orbitals are expected to emerge among elements after [[unbinilium|element 120]]). Each of these corresponds to an [[azimuthal quantum number]] ''l'': s to 0, p to 1, d to 2, and f to 3. Every electron also corresponds to a [[spin quantum number]] ''s'', which may equal either +1/2 or \u22121/2.<ref name=\"SO splitting\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.xpsfitting.com/2012/08/spin-orbit-splitting.html|title=Spin Orbit Splitting|date=2012|website=X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Reference Pages|publisher=[[University of Western Ontario]]|url-status=live|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Thus, the [[total angular momentum quantum number]] ''j = l'' + ''s'' is equal to ''j'' = ''l'' \u00b1 1/2 (except for ''l'' = 0, for which for both electrons in each orbital ''j ='' 0 + 1/2 = 1/2).<ref name=\"SO splitting\"/> [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] of an electron [[spin\u2013orbit interaction|interacts]] with its orbit, which leads to a split of a subshell into two with different energies (the one with ''j'' = ''l'' \u2212 1/2 is lower in energy and thus these electrons more difficult to extract):<ref>{{cite book|last=Thayer|first=J.

The brand's first product was released in 2010 as a solution to keep [[athlete]]s and amateur sportspeople warm that were regularly exposed to the elements.

By 2016, the item was used for a variety of sports and sports events.\n\n==History==\ndryrobe was first released in 2010.
