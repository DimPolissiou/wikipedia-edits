For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44-50</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling.

Like the natural numbers, {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[Countable set|countably infinite]].\n\nThe integers form the smallest [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and the smallest [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] containing the [[natural number]]s. In [[algebraic number theory]], the integers are sometimes qualified as '''rational integers''' to distinguish them from the more general [[algebraic integer]]s. In fact, the (rational) integers are the algebraic integers that are also [[rational number]]s.\n\n==Symbol==\n\nThe symbol {{math|'''Z'''}} can be annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: {{math|'''Z'''<sup>+</sup>}}, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>+</sub>}} or {{math|'''Z'''<sup>></sup>}} for the positive integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2265</sup>}} for non-negative integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2260</sup>}} for non-zero integers. Some authors use {{math|'''Z'''<sup>*</sup>}} for non-zero integers, others use it for non-negative integers, or for {{math|{\u20131, 1}{{void}}}}. Additionally, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used to denote either the set of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''p''}}]], i.e., a set of [[congruence relation|congruence classes]] of integers, or the set of [[p-adic integer|{{math|''p''}}-adic integers]].<ref name=edexcelc1>Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008</ref><ref>LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Z^* |id=Z^*}}</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long [[number line]]. In the above, non-[[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|negative]] integers are shown in blue and negative integers in red.]]\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nLike the [[natural numbers]], {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of addition and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,&nbsp;{{num|0}}, {{math|'''Z'''}} (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. The integers form a [[unital ring]] which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] from the integers into this ring. This [[universal property]], namely to be an [[initial object]] in the [[category of rings]], characterizes the ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,&nbsp;1 divided by&nbsp;2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under [[exponentiation]], the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following table lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Properties of addition and multiplication on integers\n!\n!scope=\"col\" |Addition\n!scope=\"col\" |Multiplication\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Associativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') \u00d7 ''c''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Commutativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' \u00d7 ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of an [[identity element]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 1 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of [[inverse element]]s:\n|{{math|''a'' + (\u2212''a'') {{=}} 0}}\n|The only invertible integers (called [[Unit (ring theory)|units]]) are {{math|\u22121}} and&nbsp;{{math|1}}.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Distributivity]]:\n|colspan=2 align=center |{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}{{pad|1em}}and{{pad|1em}}{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') \u00d7 ''c'' {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'') + (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |No [[zero divisor]]s:\n| || | If {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both)\n|}\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], the first five properties listed above for addition say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is an [[abelian group]]. It is also a [[cyclic group]], since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum {{nowrap|1 + 1 + \u2026 + 1}} or {{nowrap|(\u22121) + (\u22121) + \u2026 + (\u22121)}}. In fact, {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is the ''only'' infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is a [[commutative monoid]]. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|2''x'' {{=}} 1}}. This means that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with addition and multiplication is a [[commutative ring]] with [[multiplicative identity|unity]]. It is the prototype of all objects of such [[algebraic structure]]. Only those [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] of [[algebraic expression|expressions]] are true in&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} [[for all]] values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Certain non-zero integers map to [[additive identity|zero]] in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of [[zero divisor]]s in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} is an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under division, means that {{math|'''Z'''}} is ''not'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The smallest field containing the integers as a [[subring]] is the field of [[rational number]]s. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the [[field of fractions]] of any integral domain. And back, starting from an [[algebraic number field]] (an extension of rational numbers), its [[ring of integers]] can be extracted, which includes {{math|'''Z'''}} as its [[subring]].\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on {{math|'''Z'''}}, the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called [[Euclidean division]] and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}, there exist unique integers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''q'' \u00d7 ''b'' + ''r''}} and {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' <  {{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}}, where {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of {{math|''b''}}. The integer {{math|''q''}} is called the ''quotient'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''b''}}. The [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way.<ref>{{citation | last=Serge|first = Lang |authorlink=Serge Lang |title = Algebra |edition=3rd| publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-201-55540-0|pp =86\u201387}}</ref> This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n==Order-theoretic properties==\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without [[upper and lower bounds|upper or lower bound]].

Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.\n\nThe ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:\n# if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|''c'' < ''d''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' < ''b'' + ''d''}}\n# if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|0 < ''c''}}, then {{math|''ac'' < ''bc''}}.\n\nIt follows that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with the above ordering is an [[ordered ring]].\n\nThe integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are [[well-ordered]].<ref>{{citation|title=Modern Algebra|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Seth|last=Warner|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2012|isbn=978-0-486-13709-4|at=Theorem 20.14, p.&nbsp;185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqHDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA185|access-date=2015-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906083836/https://books.google.com/books?id=TqHDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA185|archive-date=2015-09-06|url-status=live}}.</ref> This is equivalent to the statement that any [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[valuation ring]] is either a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Relative numbers representation.svg|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers \u22125 to 5\n|Red points represent ordered pairs of [[natural number]]s.

The natural number {{math|''n''}} is identified with the class {{math|[(''n'',0)]}} (in other words the natural numbers are [[embedding|embedded]] into the integers by map sending {{math|''n''}} to {{math|[(''n'',0)]}}), and the class {{math|[(0,''n'')]}} is denoted {{math|\u2212''n''}} (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class {{math|[(0,0)]}} a second time since {{math|\u22120 {{=}} 0.}}\n\nThus, {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} is denoted by\n:<math>\\begin{cases} a - b, & \\mbox{if }  a \\ge b  \\\\ -(b - a),  & \\mbox{if } a < b. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar [[group representation|representation]] of the integers as  {{math|{\u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026}}}.\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 0 &= [(0,0)] &= [(1,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k)] \\\\\n 1 &= [(1,0)] &= [(2,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+1,k)] \\\\\n-1 &= [(0,1)] &= [(1,2)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+1)] \\\\\n 2 &= [(2,0)] &= [(3,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+2,k)] \\\\\n-2 &= [(0,2)] &= [(1,3)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+2)].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[Rewriting|term rewrite engines]].\nIntegers are represented as [[Term algebra|algebraic terms]] built using a few basic operations  (such as '''zero''', '''succ''', '''pred''', etc.) and, possibly, using [[natural number]]s, which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Garavel |first=Hubert |title=On the Most Suitable Axiomatization of Signed Integers |conference=Post-proceedings of the 23rd International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques (WADT'2016) |year=2017 |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=10644 |pages=120\u2013134 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_9 |url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321 |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126125528/https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321 |archive-date=2018-01-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation '''pair'''<math>(x,y)</math> that takes as arguments two natural numbers <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and returns an integer (equal to <math>x-y</math>). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written '''pair'''(0,0), or '''pair'''(1,1), or '''pair'''(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\n==Computer science==\n{{Main|Integer (computer science)}}\nAn integer is often a primitive [[data type]] in [[computer language]]s. However, integer data types can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common [[two's complement]] representation, the inherent definition of [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and&nbsp;0\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted ''int'' or Integer in several programming languages (such as [[Algol68]], [[C (computer language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of&nbsp;2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or&nbsp;10).\n\n==Cardinality==\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of integers is equal to {{math|\u2135{{sub|0}}}} ([[Aleph number|aleph-null]]). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a [[bijection]], that is, a function that is [[injective]] and [[surjective]] from {{math|'''Z'''}} to {{math|'''N'''}}.\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>0, 1, 2, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x \\leq 0\\\\ 2x-1, & \\mbox{if }  x > 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|<nowiki>{\u2026</nowiki> (\u22124,8) (\u22123,6) (\u22122,4) (\u22121,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) ...&#125;}}\n\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>1, 2, 3, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>g(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\ 2x+1, & \\mbox{if }  x \\ge 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|{...

In fact, the (rational) integers are the algebraic integers that are also [[rational number]]s.\n\n==Symbol==\n\nThe symbol {{math|'''Z'''}} can be annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: {{math|'''Z'''<sup>+</sup>}}, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>+</sub>}} or {{math|'''Z'''<sup>></sup>}} for the positive integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2265</sup>}} for non-negative integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2260</sup>}} for non-zero integers. Some authors use {{math|'''Z'''<sup>*</sup>}} for non-zero integers, others use it for non-negative integers, or for {{math|{\u20131, 1}{{void}}}}. Additionally, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used to denote either the set of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''p''}}]], i.e., a set of [[congruence relation|congruence classes]] of integers, or the set of [[p-adic integer|{{math|''p''}}-adic integers]].<ref name=edexcelc1>Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008</ref><ref>LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Z^* |id=Z^*}}</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long [[number line]]. In the above, non-[[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|negative]] integers are shown in blue and negative integers in red.]]\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nLike the [[natural numbers]], {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of addition and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,&nbsp;{{num|0}}, {{math|'''Z'''}} (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. The integers form a [[unital ring]] which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] from the integers into this ring. This [[universal property]], namely to be an [[initial object]] in the [[category of rings]], characterizes the ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,&nbsp;1 divided by&nbsp;2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under [[exponentiation]], the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following table lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Properties of addition and multiplication on integers\n!\n!scope=\"col\" |Addition\n!scope=\"col\" |Multiplication\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Associativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') \u00d7 ''c''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Commutativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' \u00d7 ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of an [[identity element]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 1 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of [[inverse element]]s:\n|{{math|''a'' + (\u2212''a'') {{=}} 0}}\n|The only invertible integers (called [[Unit (ring theory)|units]]) are {{math|\u22121}} and&nbsp;{{math|1}}.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Distributivity]]:\n|colspan=2 align=center |{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}{{pad|1em}}and{{pad|1em}}{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') \u00d7 ''c'' {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'') + (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |No [[zero divisor]]s:\n| || | If {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both)\n|}\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], the first five properties listed above for addition say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is an [[abelian group]]. It is also a [[cyclic group]], since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum {{nowrap|1 + 1 + \u2026 + 1}} or {{nowrap|(\u22121) + (\u22121) + \u2026 + (\u22121)}}. In fact, {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is the ''only'' infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is a [[commutative monoid]]. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|2''x'' {{=}} 1}}. This means that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with addition and multiplication is a [[commutative ring]] with [[multiplicative identity|unity]]. It is the prototype of all objects of such [[algebraic structure]]. Only those [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] of [[algebraic expression|expressions]] are true in&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} [[for all]] values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Certain non-zero integers map to [[additive identity|zero]] in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of [[zero divisor]]s in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} is an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under division, means that {{math|'''Z'''}} is ''not'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The smallest field containing the integers as a [[subring]] is the field of [[rational number]]s. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the [[field of fractions]] of any integral domain. And back, starting from an [[algebraic number field]] (an extension of rational numbers), its [[ring of integers]] can be extracted, which includes {{math|'''Z'''}} as its [[subring]].\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on {{math|'''Z'''}}, the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called [[Euclidean division]] and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}, there exist unique integers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''q'' \u00d7 ''b'' + ''r''}} and {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' <  {{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}}, where {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of {{math|''b''}}. The integer {{math|''q''}} is called the ''quotient'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''b''}}. The [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way.<ref>{{citation | last=Serge|first = Lang |authorlink=Serge Lang |title = Algebra |edition=3rd| publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-201-55540-0|pp =86\u201387}}</ref> This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n==Order-theoretic properties==\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without [[upper and lower bounds|upper or lower bound]].

The natural number {{math|''n''}} is identified with the class {{math|[(''n'',0)]}} (in other words the natural numbers are [[embedding|embedded]] into the integers by map sending {{math|''n''}} to {{math|[(''n'',0)]}}), and the class {{math|[(0,''n'')]}} is denoted {{math|\u2212''n''}} (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class {{math|[(0,0)]}} a second time since {{math|\u22120 {{=}} 0.}}\n\nThus, {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} is denoted by\n:<math>\\begin{cases} a - b, & \\mbox{if }  a \\ge b  \\\\ -(b - a),  & \\mbox{if } a < b. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar [[group representation|representation]] of the integers as  {{math|{\u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026}}}.\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 0 &= [(0,0)] &= [(1,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k)] \\\\\n 1 &= [(1,0)] &= [(2,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+1,k)] \\\\\n-1 &= [(0,1)] &= [(1,2)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+1)] \\\\\n 2 &= [(2,0)] &= [(3,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+2,k)] \\\\\n-2 &= [(0,2)] &= [(1,3)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+2)].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[Rewriting|term rewrite engines]].\nIntegers are represented as [[Term algebra|algebraic terms]] built using a few basic operations  (such as '''zero''', '''succ''', '''pred''', etc.) and, possibly, using [[natural number]]s, which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Garavel |first=Hubert |title=On the Most Suitable Axiomatization of Signed Integers |conference=Post-proceedings of the 23rd International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques (WADT'2016) |year=2017 |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=10644 |pages=120\u2013134 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_9 |url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321 |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126125528/https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321 |archive-date=2018-01-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation '''pair'''<math>(x,y)</math> that takes as arguments two natural numbers <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and returns an integer (equal to <math>x-y</math>). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written '''pair'''(0,0), or '''pair'''(1,1), or '''pair'''(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\n==Computer science==\n{{Main|Integer (computer science)}}\nAn integer is often a primitive [[data type]] in [[computer language]]s. However, integer data types can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common [[two's complement]] representation, the inherent definition of [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and&nbsp;0\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted ''int'' or Integer in several programming languages (such as [[Algol68]], [[C (computer language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of&nbsp;2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or&nbsp;10).\n\n==Cardinality==\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of integers is equal to {{math|\u2135{{sub|0}}}} ([[Aleph number|aleph-null]]). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a [[bijection]], that is, a function that is [[injective]] and [[surjective]] from {{math|'''Z'''}} to {{math|'''N'''}}.\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>0, 1, 2, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x \\leq 0\\\\ 2x-1, & \\mbox{if }  x > 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|<nowiki>{\u2026</nowiki> (\u22124,8) (\u22123,6) (\u22122,4) (\u22121,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) ...&#125;}}\n\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>1, 2, 3, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>g(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\ 2x+1, & \\mbox{if }  x \\ge 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|{...

Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various [[alloy]]s. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: [[crotales]]). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. [[Drum kit]]s usually incorporate at least a [[crash cymbal|crash]], [[ride cymbal|ride]], or [[crash/ride]], and a pair of [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a '''cymbalist'''.\n\n== Etymology and names ==\n[[File:NAMA Cymbale.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] bronze cymbal, 5th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]\n[[File:(Jurchen) Jin Dynasty bronze cymbals.JPG|thumb|A pair of bronze cymbals from the Chinese [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]]]\nThe word cymbal is derived from the [[Latin]] ''cymbalum'',<ref>{{L&S|cymbalum|ref}}</ref> which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} ''kymbalon'', \"cymbal\",<ref>{{LSJ|ku/mbalon|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7}} ''kymb\u0113'', \"cup, bowl\".<ref>{{LSJ|ku/mbh1|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7|shortref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|cymbal}}</ref>\n\nIn orchestral scores, cymbals may be indicated by the French ''cymbales''; German ''Becken'', ''Schellbecken'', ''Teller'', or ''Tschinellen''; Italian ''piatti'' or ''cinelli''; and Spanish ''platillos''.<ref name=\":0\">{{GroveOnline|title=Cymbals|author=James Blades|display-authors=etal|access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> Many of these derive from the word for [[plate (dishware)|plates]].\n\n== History ==\nCymbals have existed since ancient times. Representations of cymbals may be found in reliefs and paintings from [[Armenian Highlands]] (7th century BC<ref>{{cite book\n|author=E. Khanzadyan\n|title=Musical Instruments of [[Armenia|ancient Armenia]] (Studies of the [[History Museum of Armenia]]) \n|location=[[Yerevan]]\n|publisher=[[History Museum of Armenia]]\n|date=1959\n|volume=5\n|page=64\n}}</ref>), [[Larsa]], [[Babylonia and Assyria|Babylon]], [[Assyria]], [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and [[ancient Rome]]. References to cymbals also appear throughout the [[Bible]], through many Psalms and songs of praise to [[God]]. Cymbals may have been introduced to [[Ancient china|China]] from [[Central Asia]] in the 3rd or 4th century AD.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn India, Cymbals have been in use since the very ancient times and are still used across almost all major temples and Buddhist sites. Gigantic Aartis along Ganges which are revered by Hindus all over the world, are incomplete without large cymbals.\n\nCymbals were employed by [[Turkish Empire|Turkish]] [[janissaries]] in the 14th century or earlier. By the 17th century, such cymbals were used in European music, and more commonly played in [[military band]]s and [[orchestra]]s by the mid 18th century. Since the 19th century, some composers have called for larger roles for cymbals in musical works, and a variety of cymbal shapes, techniques, and hardware have been developed in response.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Anatomy ==\nThe anatomy of the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates.<ref>Sabian.com education, Anatomy page http://sabian.com/en/pages/anatomy-of-a-cymbal</ref> A hole is drilled in the center of the cymbal, which is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or for tying straps through (for hand playing). The bell, dome, or cup is the raised section immediately surrounding the hole. The bell produces a higher \"pinging\" [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the rest of the cymbal. The bow is the rest of the surface surrounding the bell. The bow is sometimes described in two areas: the ride and crash area. The ride area is the thicker section closer to the bell while the crash area is the thinner tapering section near the edge. The edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal.\n\nCymbals are measured by their diameter either in inches or centimeters. The size of the cymbal affects its sound, larger cymbals usually being louder and having longer [[sustain]]. The weight describes how thick the cymbal is. Cymbal weights are important to the sound they produce and how they play. Heavier cymbals have a louder volume, more cut, and better stick articulation (when using drum sticks). Thin cymbals have a fuller sound, lower pitch, and faster response.\n\nThe profile of the cymbal is the vertical distance of the bow from the bottom of the bell to the cymbal edge (higher profile cymbals are more bowl shaped). The profile affects the pitch of the cymbal: higher profile cymbals have higher pitch.\n\n== Types ==\n=== Orchestral cymbals ===\nCymbals offer a composer nearly endless amounts of color and effect. Their unique timbre allows them to project even against a full orchestra and through the heaviest of orchestrations and enhance articulation and nearly any dynamic. Cymbals have been utilized historically to suggest frenzy, fury or bacchanalian revels, as seen in the Venus music in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'', [[Grieg]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt suite]]'', and Osmin's aria \"O wie will ich triumphieren\" from [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]''.\n\n=== Crash cymbals ===\n\n[[Image:Crash cymbals profile.png|thumb|100px|A pair of crash cymbals in cross section. The bell is in green and the straps are in red.]]\n{{main|Crash cymbal}}\n[[Image:Khuti taal.jpg|thumb|200px|A type of crash cymbals used in Assam, India. It is similar to Khartal. This instrument is used in Assamese dances called Bihu.]]\n\nOrchestral [[crash cymbal]]s are traditionally used in pairs, each one having a strap set in the bell of the cymbal by which they are held. Such a pair is always known as '''crash cymbals''' or plates. The sound can be obtained by rubbing their edges together in a sliding movement for a \"sizzle\", striking them against each other in what is called a \"crash\", tapping the edge of one against the body of the other in what is called a \"tap-crash\", scraping the edge of one from the inside of the bell to the edge for a \"scrape\" or \"zischen,\" or shutting the cymbals together and choking the sound in what is called a \"hi-hat chick\" or crush. A skilled percussionist can obtain an enormous dynamic range from such cymbals. For example, in [[Beethoven's ninth symphony]], the percussionist is employed to first play cymbals pianissimo, adding a touch of colour rather than loud crash.\n\n[[Image:Chinese New Year Seattle 2007 - 25.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese-style crash cymbals in use]]\n\nCrash cymbals are usually [[damping|damped]] by pressing them against the percussionist's body. A composer may write ''laissez vibrer'', \"Let vibrate\" (usually abbreviated l.v.), ''secco'' (dry), or equivalent indications on the score; more usually, the percussionist must judge when to damp based on the written duration of a crash and the context in which it occurs. Crash cymbals have traditionally been accompanied by the [[bass drum]] playing an identical [[Part (music)|part]]. This combination, played loudly, is an effective way to accentuate a note since it contributes to both very low and very high frequency ranges and provides a satisfying \"crash-bang-wallop\". In older music the composer sometimes provided one part for this pair of instruments, writing ''senza piatti'' or ''piatti soli'' ({{lang-it|\"without cymbals\" or \"cymbals only\"}}) if only one is needed. This came from the common practice of having one percussionist play using one cymbal mounted to the shell of the bass drum. The percussionist would crash the cymbals with the left hand and use a mallet to strike the bass drum with the right. This method is nowadays often employed in pit orchestras and called for specifically by composers who desire a certain effect. [[Stravinsky]] calls for this in his ballet [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]], and [[Mahler]] calls for this in his [[Titan Symphony]]. The modern convention is for the instruments to have independent parts. However, in [[kit drumming]], a cymbal crash is still most often accompanied by a simultaneous kick to the [[bass drum]], which provides a musical effect and support to the crash.\n\n=== Hi hats ===\n{{main|Hi-hat (instrument)}}\n\nCrash cymbals evolved into the low-sock and from this to the modern [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]]. Even in a modern drum kit, they remain paired with the bass drum as the two instruments which are played with the player's feet. However, hi-hat cymbals tend to be heavy with little taper, more similar to a [[ride cymbal]] than to a [[clash cymbal]] as found in a drum kit, and perform a ride rather than a crash function.\n\n=== Suspended cymbal ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)]] -->\n{{Main|Suspended cymbal}}\nAnother use of cymbals is the [[suspended cymbal]]. This instrument takes its name from the traditional method of suspending the cymbal by means of a leather strap or rope, thus allowing the cymbal to vibrate as freely as possible for maximum musical effect. Early jazz drumming pioneers borrowed this style of cymbal mounting during the early 1900s and later drummers further developed this instrument into the mounted horizontal or nearly horizontally mounted \"crash\" cymbals of a modern [[drum kit]], However, most modern drum kits do not employ a leather strap suspension system. Many modern drum kits use a mount with felt or otherwise dampening fabric to act as a barrier to hold the cymbals between metal clamps: thus forming the modern day ride cymbal. Suspended cymbals can be played with yarn-, sponge-, or cord wrapped [[Drum stick#Mallets|mallets]]. The first known instance of using a sponge-headed mallet on a cymbal is the final chord of Hector Berlioz' [[Symphonie Fantastique]]. Composers sometimes specifically request other types of mallets like felt mallets or [[timpani]] mallets for different attack and sustain qualities. Suspended cymbals can produce bright and slicing tones when forcefully struck, and give an eerie transparent \"windy\" sound when played quietly. A tremolo, or roll (played with two mallets alternately striking on opposing sides of the cymbal) can build in volume from almost inaudible to an overwhelming climax in a satisfyingly smooth manner (as in Humperdink's Mother Goose Suite).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blades|first1=James|title=Percussion instruments and their history|date=1992|publisher=Bold Strummer|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0933224612|page=[https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame/page/380 380<!--|pages=513|edition=Rev.-->]|url=https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame/page/380}}</ref> The edge of a suspended cymbal may be hit with shoulder of a [[drum stick]] to obtain a sound somewhat akin to that of clash cymbals. Other methods of playing include scraping a coin or [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] beater rapidly across the ridges on the top of the cymbal, giving a \"zing\" sound (as some percussionists do in the fourth movement of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 9]]). Other effects that can be used include drawing a bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound like squealing car brakes.\n\n=== Ancient cymbals ===\nAncient, antique or tuned cymbals are much more rarely called for. Their timbre is entirely different, more like that of small hand-bells or of the notes of the keyed harmonica. They are not struck full against each other, but by one of their edges, and the note given in by them is higher in proportion as they are thicker and smaller.

Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various [[alloy]]s. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: [[crotales]]). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. [[Drum kit]]s usually incorporate at least a [[crash cymbal|crash]], [[ride cymbal|ride]], or [[crash/ride]], and a pair of [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a '''cymbalist'''.\n\n== Etymology and names ==\n[[File:NAMA Cymbale.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] bronze cymbal, 5th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]\n[[File:(Jurchen) Jin Dynasty bronze cymbals.JPG|thumb|A pair of bronze cymbals from the Chinese [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]]]\nThe word cymbal is derived from the [[Latin]] ''cymbalum'',<ref>{{L&S|cymbalum|ref}}</ref> which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} ''kymbalon'', \"cymbal\",<ref>{{LSJ|ku/mbalon|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7}} ''kymb\u0113'', \"cup, bowl\".<ref>{{LSJ|ku/mbh1|\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7|shortref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|cymbal}}</ref>\n\nIn orchestral scores, cymbals may be indicated by the French ''cymbales''; German ''Becken'', ''Schellbecken'', ''Teller'', or ''Tschinellen''; Italian ''piatti'' or ''cinelli''; and Spanish ''platillos''.<ref name=\":0\">{{GroveOnline|title=Cymbals|author=James Blades|display-authors=etal|access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> Many of these derive from the word for [[plate (dishware)|plates]].\n\n== History ==\nCymbals have existed since ancient times. Representations of cymbals may be found in reliefs and paintings from [[Armenian Highlands]] (7th century BC<ref>{{cite book\n|author=E. Khanzadyan\n|title=Musical Instruments of [[Armenia|ancient Armenia]] (Studies of the [[History Museum of Armenia]]) \n|location=[[Yerevan]]\n|publisher=[[History Museum of Armenia]]\n|date=1959\n|volume=5\n|page=64\n}}</ref>), [[Larsa]], [[Babylonia and Assyria|Babylon]], [[Assyria]], [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and [[ancient Rome]]. References to cymbals also appear throughout the [[Bible]], through many Psalms and songs of praise to [[God]]. Cymbals may have been introduced to [[Ancient china|China]] from [[Central Asia]] in the 3rd or 4th century AD.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn India, Cymbals have been in use since the very ancient times and are still used across almost all major temples and Buddhist sites. Gigantic Aartis along Ganges which are revered by Hindus all over the world, are incomplete without large cymbals.\n\nCymbals were employed by [[Turkish Empire|Turkish]] [[janissaries]] in the 14th century or earlier. By the 17th century, such cymbals were used in European music, and more commonly played in [[military band]]s and [[orchestra]]s by the mid 18th century. Since the 19th century, some composers have called for larger roles for cymbals in musical works, and a variety of cymbal shapes, techniques, and hardware have been developed in response.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Anatomy ==\nThe anatomy of the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates.<ref>Sabian.com education, Anatomy page http://sabian.com/en/pages/anatomy-of-a-cymbal</ref> A hole is drilled in the center of the cymbal, which is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or for tying straps through (for hand playing). The bell, dome, or cup is the raised section immediately surrounding the hole. The bell produces a higher \"pinging\" [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the rest of the cymbal. The bow is the rest of the surface surrounding the bell. The bow is sometimes described in two areas: the ride and crash area. The ride area is the thicker section closer to the bell while the crash area is the thinner tapering section near the edge. The edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal.\n\nCymbals are measured by their diameter either in inches or centimeters. The size of the cymbal affects its sound, larger cymbals usually being louder and having longer [[sustain]]. The weight describes how thick the cymbal is. Cymbal weights are important to the sound they produce and how they play. Heavier cymbals have a louder volume, more cut, and better stick articulation (when using drum sticks). Thin cymbals have a fuller sound, lower pitch, and faster response.\n\nThe profile of the cymbal is the vertical distance of the bow from the bottom of the bell to the cymbal edge (higher profile cymbals are more bowl shaped). The profile affects the pitch of the cymbal: higher profile cymbals have higher pitch.\n\n== Types ==\n=== Orchestral cymbals ===\nCymbals offer a composer nearly endless amounts of color and effect. Their unique timbre allows them to project even against a full orchestra and through the heaviest of orchestrations and enhance articulation and nearly any dynamic. Cymbals have been utilized historically to suggest frenzy, fury or bacchanalian revels, as seen in the Venus music in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'', [[Grieg]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt suite]]'', and Osmin's aria \"O wie will ich triumphieren\" from [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]''.\n\n=== Crash cymbals ===\n\n[[Image:Crash cymbals profile.png|thumb|100px|A pair of crash cymbals in cross section. The bell is in green and the straps are in red.]]\n{{main|Crash cymbal}}\n[[Image:Khuti taal.jpg|thumb|200px|A type of crash cymbals used in Assam, India. It is similar to Khartal. This instrument is used in Assamese dances called Bihu.]]\n\nOrchestral [[crash cymbal]]s are traditionally used in pairs, each one having a strap set in the bell of the cymbal by which they are held. Such a pair is always known as '''crash cymbals''' or plates. The sound can be obtained by rubbing their edges together in a sliding movement for a \"sizzle\", striking them against each other in what is called a \"crash\", tapping the edge of one against the body of the other in what is called a \"tap-crash\", scraping the edge of one from the inside of the bell to the edge for a \"scrape\" or \"zischen,\" or shutting the cymbals together and choking the sound in what is called a \"hi-hat chick\" or crush. A skilled percussionist can obtain an enormous dynamic range from such cymbals. For example, in [[Beethoven's ninth symphony]], the percussionist is employed to first play cymbals pianissimo, adding a touch of colour rather than loud crash.\n\n[[Image:Chinese New Year Seattle 2007 - 25.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese-style crash cymbals in use]]\n\nCrash cymbals are usually [[damping|damped]] by pressing them against the percussionist's body. A composer may write ''laissez vibrer'', \"Let vibrate\" (usually abbreviated l.v.), ''secco'' (dry), or equivalent indications on the score; more usually, the percussionist must judge when to damp based on the written duration of a crash and the context in which it occurs. Crash cymbals have traditionally been accompanied by the [[bass drum]] playing an identical [[Part (music)|part]]. This combination, played loudly, is an effective way to accentuate a note since it contributes to both very low and very high frequency ranges and provides a satisfying \"crash-bang-wallop\". In older music the composer sometimes provided one part for this pair of instruments, writing ''senza piatti'' or ''piatti soli'' ({{lang-it|\"without cymbals\" or \"cymbals only\"}}) if only one is needed. This came from the common practice of having one percussionist play using one cymbal mounted to the shell of the bass drum. The percussionist would crash the cymbals with the left hand and use a mallet to strike the bass drum with the right. This method is nowadays often employed in pit orchestras and called for specifically by composers who desire a certain effect. [[Stravinsky]] calls for this in his ballet [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]], and [[Mahler]] calls for this in his [[Titan Symphony]]. The modern convention is for the instruments to have independent parts. However, in [[kit drumming]], a cymbal crash is still most often accompanied by a simultaneous kick to the [[bass drum]], which provides a musical effect and support to the crash.\n\n=== Hi hats ===\n{{main|Hi-hat (instrument)}}\n\nCrash cymbals evolved into the low-sock and from this to the modern [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]]. Even in a modern drum kit, they remain paired with the bass drum as the two instruments which are played with the player's feet. However, hi-hat cymbals tend to be heavy with little taper, more similar to a [[ride cymbal]] than to a [[clash cymbal]] as found in a drum kit, and perform a ride rather than a crash function.\n\n=== Suspended cymbal ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)]] -->\n{{Main|Suspended cymbal}}\nAnother use of cymbals is the [[suspended cymbal]]. This instrument takes its name from the traditional method of suspending the cymbal by means of a leather strap or rope, thus allowing the cymbal to vibrate as freely as possible for maximum musical effect. Early jazz drumming pioneers borrowed this style of cymbal mounting during the early 1900s and later drummers further developed this instrument into the mounted horizontal or nearly horizontally mounted \"crash\" cymbals of a modern [[drum kit]], However, most modern drum kits do not employ a leather strap suspension system. Many modern drum kits use a mount with felt or otherwise dampening fabric to act as a barrier to hold the cymbals between metal clamps: thus forming the modern day ride cymbal. Suspended cymbals can be played with yarn-, sponge-, or cord wrapped [[Drum stick#Mallets|mallets]]. The first known instance of using a sponge-headed mallet on a cymbal is the final chord of Hector Berlioz' [[Symphonie Fantastique]]. Composers sometimes specifically request other types of mallets like felt mallets or [[timpani]] mallets for different attack and sustain qualities. Suspended cymbals can produce bright and slicing tones when forcefully struck, and give an eerie transparent \"windy\" sound when played quietly. A tremolo, or roll (played with two mallets alternately striking on opposing sides of the cymbal) can build in volume from almost inaudible to an overwhelming climax in a satisfyingly smooth manner (as in Humperdink's Mother Goose Suite).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blades|first1=James|title=Percussion instruments and their history|date=1992|publisher=Bold Strummer|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0933224612|page=[https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame/page/380 380<!--|pages=513|edition=Rev.-->]|url=https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame/page/380}}</ref> The edge of a suspended cymbal may be hit with shoulder of a [[drum stick]] to obtain a sound somewhat akin to that of clash cymbals. Other methods of playing include scraping a coin or [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] beater rapidly across the ridges on the top of the cymbal, giving a \"zing\" sound (as some percussionists do in the fourth movement of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 9]]). Other effects that can be used include drawing a bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound like squealing car brakes.\n\n=== Ancient cymbals ===\nAncient, antique or tuned cymbals are much more rarely called for. Their timbre is entirely different, more like that of small hand-bells or of the notes of the keyed harmonica. They are not struck full against each other, but by one of their edges, and the note given in by them is higher in proportion as they are thicker and smaller. Berlioz's ''Romeo and Juliet'' calls for two pairs of cymbals, modelled on some old Pompeian instruments no larger than the hand (some are no larger than a crown piece), and tuned to F and B flat. The modern instruments descended from this line are the [[crotales]].\n\n=== List of cymbal types ===\n\n[[Image:Hi-hats.jpg|thumb|Hi-hats.
