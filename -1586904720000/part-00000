The series was originally [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Sega Sports]], and is now published by [[2K Sports]]. All of the games in the franchise have been developed by [[Visual Concepts]]. The series consists of eighteen main installments and several spinoff-style titles. It has seen releases on eighteen different platforms. The ''NBA 2K'' series has also been used in [[eSports]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach installment in the ''NBA 2K'' emulate the [[National Basketball Association]], and present improvements over the previous installments. As such, gameplay simulates a typical game of basketball, with the player controlling an entire team or a select player; objectives coincide with the [[rules of basketball]] and presentation resembles actual televised NBA games. Various game modes have been featured in the series, allowing for gameplay variety. Numerous elements of the games feature customizable options. Each game features the teams and players from the current NBA season; historic NBA teams and players have also been featured, as have [[EuroLeague]] teams and (starting with ''[[NBA 2K20]]'') [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] teams. Fictional players and teams can also be created and compiled.<ref name=\"Polygon article\">[http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/3/5775846/nba-2k-best-sports-game-last-generation-ps3-xbox-360 \"Looking back on NBA 2K: The best sports game of the last generation\"].

He worked on a series of high-profile [[public corruption]] cases and later resigned in protest of an ethics scandal and associated investigations into [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edwin Meese]].\n\nWeld was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in [[1990 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|1990]]. In the [[1994 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|1994 election]], he was reelected by the largest margin of victory in Massachusetts history. In [[1996 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|1996]], he was the Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate]] in Massachusetts, losing to Democratic incumbent [[John Kerry]]. Weld resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President [[Bill Clinton]] to serve as [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Mexico|United States Ambassador to Mexico]]; due to opposition by socially conservative [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations committee]] Chairman [[Jesse Helms]], he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination. After moving to New York in 2000, Weld sought the Republican nomination for Governor of New York in the [[2006 New York gubernatorial election|2006 election]]; when the Republican Party instead endorsed [[John Faso]], Weld withdrew from the race.\n\nWeld became involved in presidential politics in later years. In 2016, he left the Republican Party to become the Libertarian Party [[running mate]] of former [[Governor of New Mexico]] [[Gary Johnson]]. They received nearly 4.5&nbsp;million votes, the highest number for a Libertarian ticket, and the best for any third-party ticket since [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. \n\nReturning to the Republican Party, Weld announced in April 2019 that he would challenge President [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2020 Republican Party presidential primaries|2020 Republican primaries]], launching his campaign. He won his first and only delegate of the primaries in the [[2020 Iowa Republican caucuses|Iowa caucus]] in February, making him the first Republican since [[Pat Buchanan]] in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] to win a delegate while running against an incumbent president. Weld suspended his campaign on March 18, 2020.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Weld family}}\nWeld was born in [[Smithtown, New York]]. Weld's father, David (1911\u20131972), was an investment banker; his mother, Mary Nichols Weld (1913\u20131986), was a descendant of [[William Floyd]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]].

He worked on a series of high-profile [[public corruption]] cases and later resigned in protest of an ethics scandal and associated investigations into [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edwin Meese]].\n\nWeld was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in [[1990 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|1990]]. In the [[1994 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|1994 election]], he was reelected by the largest margin of victory in Massachusetts history. In [[1996 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|1996]], he was the Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate]] in Massachusetts, losing to Democratic incumbent [[John Kerry]]. Weld resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President [[Bill Clinton]] to serve as [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Mexico|United States Ambassador to Mexico]]; due to opposition by socially conservative [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations committee]] Chairman [[Jesse Helms]], he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination. After moving to New York in 2000, Weld sought the Republican nomination for Governor of New York in the [[2006 New York gubernatorial election|2006 election]]; when the Republican Party instead endorsed [[John Faso]], Weld withdrew from the race.\n\nWeld became involved in presidential politics in later years. In 2016, he left the Republican Party to become the Libertarian Party [[running mate]] of former [[Governor of New Mexico]] [[Gary Johnson]]. They received nearly 4.5&nbsp;million votes, the highest number for a Libertarian ticket, and the best for any third-party ticket since [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. \n\nReturning to the Republican Party, Weld announced in April 2019 that he would challenge President [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2020 Republican Party presidential primaries|2020 Republican primaries]], launching his campaign. He won his first and only delegate of the primaries in the [[2020 Iowa Republican caucuses|Iowa caucus]] in February, making him the first Republican since [[Pat Buchanan]] in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] to win a delegate while running against an incumbent president. Weld suspended his campaign on March 18, 2020.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Weld family}}\nWeld was born in [[Smithtown, New York]].

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname ''[[FitzClarence]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nDorothea (often called '''Dorothy''' or '''Dora''') Bland was born near [[Waterford]] City in [[Ireland]] on 22 November 1761<ref> \"Dorothea Jordan\", Encyclopeadia Britannica Online. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dorothea-Jordan Retrieved 11th February, 2020.</ref>, and was baptised at [[St Martin in the Fields]], Middlesex, on 5 December of that year.<ref name =\"Camp\">[http://anthonyjcamp.com/page13.htm Anthony J. Camp: ''Ancestry of Mrs Jordan''] [retrieved 4 December 2014].</ref> She was the third of six children born from Francis Bland (b. 1736{{snd}}d. Dover, 2 January 1778) and his mistress, Grace Phillips (b. ca. 1740{{snd}}d. Edinburgh, 1789). Her older siblings are George Bland ({{circa|1758}}{{snd}}Boston, Massachusetts, 1807; actor and singer) and Hester Bland (baptised at St Anne Soho, Middlesex, 2 March 1760{{snd}}buried at St David's, as of Trelethin, 8 March 1848), and her younger siblings are Lucy Bland (1763/64{{snd}}Trelethin, St David's, 1778, aged 14), Francis Bland ({{fl.|1813}}; a captain, unmarried and without issue) and Nathaniel Phillips Bland (born 1766/67{{snd}}buried at St David's, Pembrokeshire, 3 June 1830, aged 63).<ref name =\"Camp\"/>\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Nathaniel Bland (Killarney, co. Kerry, 1695/96{{snd}}1760), [[Vicar General]] of [[Ardfert]] and [[Aghada]], and Judge of the [[Prerogative Court]] of [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], and his second wife Lucy (n\u00e9e Heaton).<ref name =\"Camp\"/> The reports about Dorothea's maternal ancestry  are very sketchy, although it is generally stated that Grace Phillips was probably the daughter of a Welsh clergyman (who lived in the early 1750s in Bristol) but he has not been identified with certainty.<ref name =\"Camp\"/>\n\nBefore April 1774, when she was 13, Dorothea's father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family<ref name =\"Camp\"/> to marry an Irish actress. However, he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money. This allowance was on the condition that the children would not use his last name. <ref name=\"odnb\">{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15119|title=Jordan, Dorothy [real name Dorothy Phillips] (1761\u20131816), actress {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15119|access-date=2019-10-24|year=2004}}</ref> Dorothea then adopted her mother's maiden name, Phillips. This situation forced Dorothea to work to help her siblings. Her mother, an actress by profession, saw potential in Dorothea and put her on the stage. Dora became a famous actress and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage.\n\n\n==Theatrical career ==\nThe historical record of Jordan's first stage appearance is not clear. Some sources claim that Jordan made her debut in 1777 in [[Dublin]], as Phoebe in ''[[As You Like It]],'' whilst others that suggest she premiered as Lucy in the Interlude ''The Virgin Unmask'd,'' on the 3rd November 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A biographical dictionary of actors, actresses, musicians, dancers, managers & other stage personnel in London, 1660-1800.

Documentation shows her last appearance in Dublin came on the 16th May 1782 when she spoke the ''The Maid of Oaks'''  Prologue''.'' At the time she was pregnant with the illegitimate child of the married theatre manager of the Smock Alley Theatre, Richard Daly.  \n\nRumours spread and she fled to England, specifically [[Leeds]], where she was employed by [[Tate Wilkinson]], manager of the York Company.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Mrs Jordan, Volume 2 : Including Original Private Correspondence, and Numerous Anecdotes of her Contemporaries|last=James|first=Boaden|isbn=9781139452915|location=Cambridge|oclc=967377202}}</ref> It was during this move that she adopted the surname 'Jordan,' and like all the other women in the company (both unmarried and married), adopted the title \"Mrs.\" Her first performance in England was the tragic role of Calista in ''[[The Fair Penitent]],''  on 11 July 1782 for which she had been tutored for by the scholar Cornelious Swan.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Mrs Jordan's profession|last=Claire.|first=Tomalin|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780241963296|location=London|oclc=779244420}}</ref> Wilkinson paid her 15 shillings a week and she quickly won over the favour of her audiences, packing theatres.  Despite the actresses versatile acting talents, the critics were not pleased with her performing tragedy roles. Dora was faced harsh criticism from these roles as she was not considered socially acceptable to play women of a higher standing.<ref>Mrs Jordan (Dorothy Jordan).

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular breeches roles. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark, was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. She took the offer and performed for Wilkinson's company for a final time on 9 September 1785 before departing to London with her mother, two-year-old daughter and sister Hester.  \n\nThough no specific dates can be sourced, Dora is believed to have performed the role of Lady Teazle in Sheridan's [[The School for Scandal]] before she arrived in London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piozzi letters : correspondence of Hester Lynch Piozzi, 1784-1821 (formerly Mrs. Thrale)|last=Piozzi|first= Hester Lynch|date=|publisher=University of Delaware Press|others=Bloom, Edward A.

She lived frugally but always paid her rent on time. Not having been summoned back to England, she moved to Versailles by the end of the year. Soon after, she moved to [[Saint-Cloud]], near Paris. It is suggested that she made these last two moved to be closer to her son Frederick, who was stationed in Paris as part of the British Army. While in France, she was defrauded by eldest daughter, Frances and son-in-law, Thomas Alsop after they accumulated large sums of debt in her name. During this time, both her mental and physical health was declining. Her health was worsening and she suffered from \u2018bilious attacks, pains in her side, swollen ankles, shortness of breath and increasing general weakness\u2019. She missed her children terribly and confessed in a letter that \u201cits is not, believe me, the feelings of pride, avarice, or the absence of those comforts I have all my life been accustomed to, that is killing me by inches; it is the loss of my only remaining comfort, the hope I used to live on from time to time, of seeing my children\u201d.

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson come to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular breeches roles. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark, was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].

Once the Duke received word of this, he removed their remaining daughters from her care, and took back her yearly stipend. Dora had written letters to British theatre's and newspapers pleading with them to rehire her, acknowledging her prior mistress behaviour, expanding her celebrity status.<ref>Mrs Jordan (Dorothy Jordan).

She lived frugally but always paid her rent on time. Not having been summoned back to England, she moved to Versailles by the end of the year. Soon after, she moved to [[Saint-Cloud]], near Paris. It is suggested that she made these last two moved to be closer to her son Frederick, who was stationed in Paris as part of the British Army. While in France, she was defrauded by eldest daughter, Frances and son-in-law, Thomas Alsop after they accumulated large sums of debt in her name. During this time, both her mental and physical health was declining. Her health was worsening and she suffered from \u2018bilious attacks, pains in her side, swollen ankles, shortness of breath and increasing general weakness\u2019. She missed her children terribly and confessed in a letter that \u201cits is not, believe me, the feelings of pride, avarice, or the absence of those comforts I have all my life been accustomed to, that is killing me by inches; it is the loss of my only remaining comfort, the hope I used to live on from time to time, of seeing my children\u201d.

Outlining her economic views, she writes: {{cquote|\"Russia is a country of a free economy with a strong state sector. All large state corporations should be privatized with antitrust restrictions. The state should not control any sectors of the economy, the state's share in enterprises and industries should be limited to breaking up monopolies. Private property should be protected by law, the review of any ownership and nationalization are possible only on a reimbursable basis on the basis of independent market valuations. Reform of tax and regulatory legislation and practices should stimulate the development of private entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized businesses, technological and innovative development of enterprises, education. The list of licensed branches of the economy should be significantly reduced.\"<ref name=\"vedomosti.ru\">[https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2017/09/30/736005-sobchak-viborah-prezidenta Ksenia Sobchak announced the participation in the presidential elections in Russia] October 18 18:30, Ksenia Sobchak for Vedomosti</ref>}}\n\n=== Views on patriotism and nationalism ===\nSobchak describes herself as a patriot and a nationalist. However, she believes that much of the patriotism in Russia today is artificial. She writes, contrasting patriotism unfavorably with the situation in Israel: \"Israel, in my opinion, is a hymn to the power of the human spirit... Patriotism, not imposed from above, but born within a person. And that's another amazing thing. This sense of the importance of your life for the state [in Israel] is created by many more small, as if imperceptible actions... And these little details are much more valuable than all the spirit-lifting speeches on May Day and Victory Day. And I sit, listen and feel bitter from the fact that in my home country all this is not\".<ref>[https://snob.ru/profile/24691/blog/77683 Israeli lessons of patriotism] K.

In her manifesto, she derides the lack of women's representation in industry and politics. \"Almost 500 heavy professions in Russia are officially closed to women. But among all the others - the salary of a woman is almost 30% less than that of a man. Among the most important companies in the country, women head only about 5%. ...

Outlining her economic views, she writes: {{cquote|\"Russia is a country of a free economy with a strong state sector. All large state corporations should be privatized with antitrust restrictions. The state should not control any sectors of the economy, the state's share in enterprises and industries should be limited to breaking up monopolies. Private property should be protected by law, the review of any ownership and nationalization are possible only on a reimbursable basis on the basis of independent market valuations. Reform of tax and regulatory legislation and practices should stimulate the development of private entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized businesses, technological and innovative development of enterprises, education. The list of licensed branches of the economy should be significantly reduced.\"<ref name=\"vedomosti.ru\">[https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2017/09/30/736005-sobchak-viborah-prezidenta Ksenia Sobchak announced the participation in the presidential elections in Russia] October 18 18:30, Ksenia Sobchak for Vedomosti</ref>}}\n\n=== Views on patriotism and nationalism ===\nSobchak describes herself as a patriot and a nationalist. However, she believes that much of the patriotism in Russia today is artificial. She writes, contrasting patriotism unfavorably with the situation in Israel: \"Israel, in my opinion, is a hymn to the power of the human spirit... Patriotism, not imposed from above, but born within a person. And that's another amazing thing. This sense of the importance of your life for the state [in Israel] is created by many more small, as if imperceptible actions... And these little details are much more valuable than all the spirit-lifting speeches on May Day and Victory Day. And I sit, listen and feel bitter from the fact that in my home country all this is not\".<ref>[https://snob.ru/profile/24691/blog/77683 Israeli lessons of patriotism] K.Sobchak, 16:48, 22.06.14, snob.ru</ref>\n\n=== Views on feminism ===\nSobchak describes herself as a feminist. In her manifesto, she derides the lack of women's representation in industry and politics. \"Almost 500 heavy professions in Russia are officially closed to women. But among all the others - the salary of a woman is almost 30% less than that of a man. Among the most important companies in the country, women head only about 5%. ...

This consolidation caused dissent, especially among faculty,<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/president/pastpresidents/chace.html Past Presidents of Wesleyan: Chace]</ref> but in his  own reflections on his tenure there, Chace cited as one of his prime imperatives the need to improve the quality of the faculty.  He also wanted the faculty to take more responsibility for decision making. Writing about it in \u201cInside Higher Education\u201d, Chace wrote \u201cfaculty members are not so much the employees of the institution as they are its intellectual engine and its most important asset. They are \"capital\" rather than \"labor.\u201d\u201d <ref>[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2006/09/11/chace The Puzzle of Leadership]</ref>\n\nDuring several months of student protests at Wesleyan in 1990, Chace's office was firebombed. He had been accused of being racist and uncommitted to diversity, an irony that the media noted given his early teaching at Stillman and his participation in the civil-rights movement that resulted in being \u201cthrown to the ground by police, threatened with a cattle prod, and locked in jail overnight on charges that included resisting arrest.\u201d<ref name=Turks/> Commenting on the Wesleyan incident, Chace remarked \u201c..when you become president of an institution, for some students it does not make any difference what you were once upon a time. You are 'the man.' You are the symbol or the representative of authority, and you are seen in that way.\u201d<ref name=Turks/>  Later, a group calling itself STRIKE (Students Rebuilding Institutions for Knowledge and Education) claimed responsibility for the act. Chace referred to the act as not political, but criminal.<ref name=Wesleying>|author=Zach Schonfeld |[http://wesleying.org/2010/04/20/activism-or-terrorism-the-chace-firebombing-twenty-years-on/ Activism or Terrorism: The Chace Firebombing 20 years on]</ref> In 2013, Chace said his years at Wesleyan were \"the hardest years of my life,\" calling the college \"a tough place for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Zach|title=\"Where Are They Now?\": An Interview with Former President William Chace|url=http://wesleying.org/2013/05/26/where-are-they-now-an-interview-with-former-president-william-chace/|publisher=Wesleying|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> \n \nDuring his tenure at Emory, the University experienced a tremendous growth as a research institution. Emory also invested $1 billion in campus renovation including a new standalone performing arts center, and a residential complex for students. Emory also worked towards making the campus environmentally sound and encouraging diversity in the student body.<ref>[http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/people/presidents/Chace.htm Emory University website page on Chace]</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Chace oversaw Emory's establishment of a campus-wide domestic partners policy for all employees, setting a trend for schools and businesses in the South,<ref name=FirstYr>[http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1996/October/ERoct.7/10_7_96first_year.html Emory Report: First year of domestic partner benefits runs smoothly]</ref> although by 2002 it remained only one of two schools in Georgia offering same-sex domestic partners benefits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Couples urge partner benefits |author=Morris News Service |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2002/12/16/met_364350.shtml |newspaper=Augusta Chronicle |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> The move prompted criticism from [[United Methodist Church]]'s Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference with which Emory has historic ties, though the conference's resolution passed by only a narrow margin. Chace responded in a lengthy letter to the presiding bishop, arguing that Emory's policy was consistent both with its educational mission and with the call to justice in the Methodist Church's [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]].<ref name=FirstYr/>\n\n==Scholarly writing==\nChace has written two scholarly books\u2013\u2013''The Political Identities of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot''(1973) and ''Lionel Trilling: Criticism and Politics'' (1983)\u2013\u2013  and  edited (with Peter Collier) ''Justice Denied: The Black Man in White America; Making It New'' (poetry anthology with JoAn E. Chace); ''James Joyce: A Collection of Critical Essays;'' and ''An Introduction to Literature'' (again with Peter Collier).\n\nHis scholarly articles include writings on Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, [[Lionel Trilling]], [[Graham Greene]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[T. E. Lawrence]] and James Joyce.  In 2008 ''Common Knowledge'' published the first of several essays and reviews Chace contributed to that magazine, \"On the Margin: Irving Howe Reconsidered\". In 2011, he contributed an essay on Ezra Pound to a volume titled \"AfterWord: Conjuring the Literary Dead\".\n\n==Writing about education==\nChace has written many articles about various aspects of and problems in higher education for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and other publications. Topics covered include [[multiculturalism]], [[political correctness]], [[consumerism]] and university finances.  ''[[The American Interest]]'' published his essay, \u201cApply and Demand,\u201d about the financing of American higher education. These topics are also addressed in his academic memoir ''100 Semesters: My Adventures as Student, Professor, and University President, and What I Learned along the Way.'' and in lectures he gave in 2006 to the [[Association of American Universities]] and the Hechinger Institute at [[Columbia University]].\n\nHis 2009 essay in ''The American Scholar'' entitled \u201cWhere Have All the Students Gone?\u201d was named by [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''The New York Times'' as one of the best essays of the year and was named by that columnist a winner of a \u201c[[Sidney Hook]] Award.\u201d  The American Scholar has also published his essays \u201cAffirmative Action\u2019s Last Chance.\u201d (2010)  and \u201cThe Truth about Campus Cheating.\u201d\n\n==Additional Publications==\n* \"The Unhappiness of Happiness\" in ''The Hedgehog Review''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chace |first=William |last2= |first2= |date= Summer 2016 |title=The Unhappiness of Happiness |url=http://www.iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2016_Summer_ChaceEXC.php |journal=The Hedgehog Review |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= April 3, 2017 }}</ref>\n* \"What I Have Taught and Learned\" in \"The American Scholar\" <ref>{{cite journal |last=Chace |first=William |last2= |first2= |date= Winter 2015 |title=What I Have Taught\u2014and Learned |url=https://theamericanscholar.org/what-i-have-taught-and-learned/#.WOKuGdltmM8 |journal=The American Scholar |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= April 3, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://theamericanscholar.org/the-decline-of-the-english-department/  ''American Scholar'' article by William Chace on Decline of the English Department]\n*[http://theamericanscholar.org/affirmative-inaction/ 'American Scholar'' article by William Chace on need for Affirmative Action in Universities ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100610163204/http://www.cha.uga.edu/news/Spring2010.pdf PDF copy of Spring 2010 issue of University of Georgia newsletter including interview with William Chace and UGA faculty on decline of humanities majors]\n\n{{Wesleyan University presidents}}\n{{Emory University presidents}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chace, William}}\n[[Category:Presidents of Wesleyan University]]\n[[Category:American academics of English literature]]\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Emory University faculty]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Emory University]]\n[[Category:Wesleyan University people]]\n[[Category:People from Newport News, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Haverford College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:Stillman College faculty]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|William Chase (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Infobox scholar\n| image            = William_Chace_at_Emory_University.jpg\n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| name             = William Chace\n| fullname         = \n| other_names      = \n| birth_date       = {{birth date and age|1938|9|3}}\n| birth_place      = [[Newport News, Virginia]]\n| death_date       =  <!-- {{Death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| death_place      = \n| era              = \n| region           = United States\n| school_tradition = \n| main_interests   = English Literature, American Education\n| notable_ideas    = \n| major_works      = ''100 Semesters''\n| influences       = Alfred Satterthwaite, Guy Davenport, Thomas Flanagan, Ralph Rader, [[Frederick Crews]]\n| influenced       = \n}}\n\n'''William Chace''' (born 1938) is a Professor of English Emeritus at [[Emory University]] as well as Honorary Professor of English Emeritus at [[Stanford University]].

He left Stanford to be President of [[Wesleyan University]] from 1988-1994, and subsequently become President of [[Emory University]] from 1994 until 2003. His presidency at Emory was marked by his acrimonious public relationship with Emory professor [[Jeffrey Sonnenfeld]], culminating in Sonnenfeld's resignation. Sonnenfeld subsequently sued Emory in the Federal Court, and during the proceedings it emerged that Chace had anonymously leaked information to the press regarding evidence admitted in the suit, in contravention to university policy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Emory president admits being source in story|author=Associated Press |url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/060799/new_0607990014.shtml |newspaper=Online Athens |date=June 7, 1999 |accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The End Of The Affair Jeffrey Sonnenfeld's battle with Emory University is finally over, but the question remains: Why on earth did Emory's president accuse Sonnenfeld of vandalism?|author=Geoffrey Colvin |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/09/04/286828/index.htm |newspaper=Fortune Magazine |date=September 4, 2000 |accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter his service as president he taught courses on Joyce and on Yeats, \u201cWar and Literature\u201d, and a course on the relationship of modern literature to ancient literature. He currently teaches a number of courses\u2014on Joyce, Yeats, Eliot and Pound\u2014at Stanford University in its Continuing Studies Program. A chair has been named in his honor in this program.\n \nChace also participated in dramatics at Stillman, acting in a production of [[Edward Albee]]'s \u201cThe Death of Bessie Smith\u201d,<ref>{{cite news |title=Stillman Play Called One of Finest Hours |author=J.

This consolidation caused dissent, especially among faculty,<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/president/pastpresidents/chace.html Past Presidents of Wesleyan: Chace]</ref> but in his  own reflections on his tenure there, Chace cited as one of his prime imperatives the need to improve the quality of the faculty.  He also wanted the faculty to take more responsibility for decision making. Writing about it in \u201cInside Higher Education\u201d, Chace wrote \u201cfaculty members are not so much the employees of the institution as they are its intellectual engine and its most important asset. They are \"capital\" rather than \"labor.\u201d\u201d <ref>[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2006/09/11/chace The Puzzle of Leadership]</ref>\n\nDuring several months of student protests at Wesleyan in 1990, Chace's office was firebombed. He had been accused of being racist and uncommitted to diversity, an irony that the media noted given his early teaching at Stillman and his participation in the civil-rights movement that resulted in being \u201cthrown to the ground by police, threatened with a cattle prod, and locked in jail overnight on charges that included resisting arrest.\u201d<ref name=Turks/> Commenting on the Wesleyan incident, Chace remarked \u201c..when you become president of an institution, for some students it does not make any difference what you were once upon a time. You are 'the man.' You are the symbol or the representative of authority, and you are seen in that way.\u201d<ref name=Turks/>  Later, a group calling itself STRIKE (Students Rebuilding Institutions for Knowledge and Education) claimed responsibility for the act. Chace referred to the act as not political, but criminal.<ref name=Wesleying>|author=Zach Schonfeld |[http://wesleying.org/2010/04/20/activism-or-terrorism-the-chace-firebombing-twenty-years-on/ Activism or Terrorism: The Chace Firebombing 20 years on]</ref> In 2013, Chace said his years at Wesleyan were \"the hardest years of my life,\" calling the college \"a tough place for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Zach|title=\"Where Are They Now?\": An Interview with Former President William Chace|url=http://wesleying.org/2013/05/26/where-are-they-now-an-interview-with-former-president-william-chace/|publisher=Wesleying|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> \n \nDuring his tenure at Emory, the University experienced a tremendous growth as a research institution. Emory also invested $1 billion in campus renovation including a new standalone performing arts center, and a residential complex for students. Emory also worked towards making the campus environmentally sound and encouraging diversity in the student body.<ref>[http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/people/presidents/Chace.htm Emory University website page on Chace]</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Chace oversaw Emory's establishment of a campus-wide domestic partners policy for all employees, setting a trend for schools and businesses in the South,<ref name=FirstYr>[http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1996/October/ERoct.7/10_7_96first_year.html Emory Report: First year of domestic partner benefits runs smoothly]</ref> although by 2002 it remained only one of two schools in Georgia offering same-sex domestic partners benefits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Couples urge partner benefits |author=Morris News Service |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2002/12/16/met_364350.shtml |newspaper=Augusta Chronicle |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> The move prompted criticism from [[United Methodist Church]]'s Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference with which Emory has historic ties, though the conference's resolution passed by only a narrow margin. Chace responded in a lengthy letter to the presiding bishop, arguing that Emory's policy was consistent both with its educational mission and with the call to justice in the Methodist Church's [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]].<ref name=FirstYr/>\n\n==Scholarly writing==\nChace has written two scholarly books\u2013\u2013''The Political Identities of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot''(1973) and ''Lionel Trilling: Criticism and Politics'' (1983)\u2013\u2013  and  edited (with Peter Collier) ''Justice Denied: The Black Man in White America; Making It New'' (poetry anthology with JoAn E. Chace); ''James Joyce: A Collection of Critical Essays;'' and ''An Introduction to Literature'' (again with Peter Collier).\n\nHis scholarly articles include writings on Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, [[Lionel Trilling]], [[Graham Greene]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[T. E. Lawrence]] and James Joyce.  In 2008 ''Common Knowledge'' published the first of several essays and reviews Chace contributed to that magazine, \"On the Margin: Irving Howe Reconsidered\". In 2011, he contributed an essay on Ezra Pound to a volume titled \"AfterWord: Conjuring the Literary Dead\".\n\n==Writing about education==\nChace has written many articles about various aspects of and problems in higher education for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and other publications. Topics covered include [[multiculturalism]], [[political correctness]], [[consumerism]] and university finances.  ''[[The American Interest]]'' published his essay, \u201cApply and Demand,\u201d about the financing of American higher education. These topics are also addressed in his academic memoir ''100 Semesters: My Adventures as Student, Professor, and University President, and What I Learned along the Way.'' and in lectures he gave in 2006 to the [[Association of American Universities]] and the Hechinger Institute at [[Columbia University]].\n\nHis 2009 essay in ''The American Scholar'' entitled \u201cWhere Have All the Students Gone?\u201d was named by [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''The New York Times'' as one of the best essays of the year and was named by that columnist a winner of a \u201c[[Sidney Hook]] Award.\u201d  The American Scholar has also published his essays \u201cAffirmative Action\u2019s Last Chance.\u201d (2010)  and \u201cThe Truth about Campus Cheating.\u201d\n\n==Additional Publications==\n* \"The Unhappiness of Happiness\" in ''The Hedgehog Review''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chace |first=William |last2= |first2= |date= Summer 2016 |title=The Unhappiness of Happiness |url=http://www.iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2016_Summer_ChaceEXC.php |journal=The Hedgehog Review |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= April 3, 2017 }}</ref>\n* \"What I Have Taught and Learned\" in \"The American Scholar\" <ref>{{cite journal |last=Chace |first=William |last2= |first2= |date= Winter 2015 |title=What I Have Taught\u2014and Learned |url=https://theamericanscholar.org/what-i-have-taught-and-learned/#.WOKuGdltmM8 |journal=The American Scholar |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= April 3, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://theamericanscholar.org/the-decline-of-the-english-department/  ''American Scholar'' article by William Chace on Decline of the English Department]\n*[http://theamericanscholar.org/affirmative-inaction/ 'American Scholar'' article by William Chace on need for Affirmative Action in Universities ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100610163204/http://www.cha.uga.edu/news/Spring2010.pdf PDF copy of Spring 2010 issue of University of Georgia newsletter including interview with William Chace and UGA faculty on decline of humanities majors]\n\n{{Wesleyan University presidents}}\n{{Emory University presidents}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chace, William}}\n[[Category:Presidents of Wesleyan University]]\n[[Category:American academics of English literature]]\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Emory University faculty]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Emory University]]\n[[Category:Wesleyan University people]]\n[[Category:People from Newport News, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Haverford College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:Stillman College faculty]]\n", "name_user": "Javert2113", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Chace"}
