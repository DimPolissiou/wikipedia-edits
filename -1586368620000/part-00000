A six-speed automatic transmission was also available for this trim level.

It added the following equipment to the base SE trim level: sixteen-inch (16\") aluminum-alloy wheels (2014 and newer models), U Connect Bluetooth with streaming audio, [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio, a six-speaker audio system (four-speaker audio system after mid-2016), air conditioning, keyless entry, and exterior color-keyed door handles and side mirrors.

Swastika was a common geometric ornament in the folk culture of Tatra mountains and for that reason it was adopted by highlander units of Polish army. The usage of swastikas by highlander regiments of the Wojsko Polskie is an ancient slavic symbol which predates the rise of the NSDAP in Germany.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of mountain warfare forces]]\n* [[Mieczys\u0142aw Boruta-Spiechowicz]]\n* [[Tadeusz Klimecki]]\n* France: [[Chasseurs Alpins]]\n* Germany: [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]\n* Italy: [[Alpini]]\n* Romania: [[V\u00e2n\u0103tori de Munte]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Podhale Rifles}}\n* [http://www.wawel.net/images/14_listopad_2004/11_list/htm/6.htm Banner of the 21st Brigade]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050127213039/http://www.pilsudski.krakow.pl/aktual/3maja/3maj4.htm Podhale Rifles in Krak\u00f3w]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212339/http://www.przemysl.pl/serwis/IMGallery/galeria.php?kategoria=15 Podhale Rifles in Przemy\u015bl, 2007]\n* [http://www.nowytarg.pl/picofday.php?cat=38 Podhale Rifles in Nowy S\u0105cz, 2007]\n\n{{Podhale Rifles}}\n\n[[Category:Army units and formations of Poland]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1918]]\n[[Category:Mountain infantry brigades]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist; title linked in text", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podhale_Rifles"}
