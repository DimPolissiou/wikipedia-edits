He built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. Around 1350, a Brahmin dynasty ruled this area.

He built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. Around 1350, a Brahmin dynasty ruled this area. In the middle of the 16th century the Maratha family of Chandarao More defeated the Brahmin dynasty and became rulers of [[Javli]] and Mahabaleshwar, during which period the temple of Old Mahabaleshwar was rebuilt.\n\nIn the 17th century [[Shivaji Maharaj]] took over Javli and Mahabaleshwar and constructed the [[Pratapgad]] fort in 1656.\n\nIn 1819, the British included the hills in the territory of the Raja of Satara. Col. Lodwick (Late General Sir ) stationed at Satara, in April 1824 with a contingent of soldiers and Indian guides climbed up the mountain face reaching what is now known as the Lodwick Point.\n\nStarting with [[Sir John Malcolm]] in 1828, a succession of them from Sir [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], Arthur Malet (for whom the seat at \"Point Arthur\" is named), Carnac, Frere and many others became regular visitors.\n\nPresent day Mahabaleshwar came into existence in the year 1829-30. In old records it is mentioned as Malcolm Peth, but in practise today it is known as Mahabaleshwar.\n\nAdded to the scores of magnificent scenic \"points\", the perennial springs, streams, and waterfalls of Mahabaleshwar plateau, with its year round superb climate, drew the English and others to Mahabaleshwar.

Starring [[Carmen Maura]], [[Olvido Gara|Alaska]], and Eva Siva, the plot follows the wild adventures of three friends: Pepi, an independent modern woman; Luci, a mousy, [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] housewife; and Bom, a lesbian [[punk rock]] singer.\n\n''Pepi, Luci, Bom'' is Almod\u00f3var's first feature film. It was shot in [[16 mm film|16mm]] and blown up to [[35 mm movie film|35mm]] for its theatrical release. It became a [[cult film]], emblematic of [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]], a period characterized by a sense of cultural and sexual freedom.<ref name = \" Edwards\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion''</ref>{{rp|18}}\n\n==Plot==\nPepi, a young independent woman living in Madrid, is filling up her [[Superman]] sticker album when she receives an unexpected visit from a neighbor policeman who has spotted her [[marijuana]] plants whilst spying on her via binoculars from across the street. Pepi tries to buy his silence with an offer of anal sex, but on discovering the plants to be plastic/artificial, the policeman rapes her instead for wasting police time. This ruins her hopes of selling her virginity for a good amount of money. Thirsty for revenge, Pepi arranges for her friend Bom, a teenage punk singer, and her band, Bomitoni (Bom and Toni and also a pun of Vomitoni-vomitona=big puke), to beat up the policeman. Wearing Madrilenian costumes and singing a ''[[zarzuela]]'', Pepi's friends give the man a merciless beating one night. However, the next day Pepi realizes that they had attacked the policeman's innocent twin brother by mistake.\n\nUndaunted, Pepi decides on a more complex form of revenge. She befriends the policeman's docile wife, Luci, from [[Murcia]], with the excuse of receiving knitting lessons. Pepi's idea is to corrupt Luci and take her away from the wife-beating policeman. During the first knitting class, Pepi's friend, Bom, arrives at the apartment heading for the restroom in order to pee. This leads to the suggestion that, since Luci feels hot, Bom should stand on a chair and urinate over Luci's face. Bom's aggressive behavior satisfies Luci's masochism and the two women become lovers. Back home, Luci has an argument with her husband in which she complains about what he had done to Pepi. When he threatens to whip and kick her out, with a renewed sense of liberation Luci leaves her husband and her home, moving in with Bom.\n\nThe three friends, Pepi, Luci and Bom are immersed in Madrid's youth scene, attending parties, clubs, concerts and meeting outrageous characters. In one of the concerts, Bom sings with her band, the Bomitonis, a song called \"Murciana marrana\" (i.e. the slut from Murcia). Luci becomes a proud groupie. The highlight of one of the parties is a penis size contest called General Erections, a competition looking for the biggest, most svelte, most inordinate penis. The winner receives the opportunity to do what he wants, how he wants, with whomever he wants. He selects Luci to give him oral sex, which makes her the most envied woman at the party.\n\nEventually Pepi is forced to find work as her father decides to stop her income. She becomes a creative writer for advertising spots designing ads for sweating, menstruating dolls and multipurpose panties that absorb urine and can double as a dildo. Pepi also begins to write a script which will be the story of lesbian lovers Luci and Bom. The [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] policeman is desperately looking for his wife. Meanwhile, he takes advantage of naive neighbor Charito, who is in love with Juan, his twin brother. Pretending to be Juan, the policeman slaps, then sexually assaults Charito.\n\nFinally, the policeman finds Luci coming out of a disco and kidnaps her from her two friends. He gives Luci a terrible beating that sends her to the hospital, where Pepi and Bom visit her. They quickly realize that they have lost Luci. She has decided to return to the person who mistreats her best \u2013 her sadistic and tyrannical husband. His brutality is what Luci has always wanted or became accustomed to. Bruised and bandaged in her hospital bed, Luci tells Bom she is returning to him for a life of abuse. Bom is lost without Luci and laments that pop is also out of fashion. Pepi has the solution to both problems. Bom should move in with Pepi as her bodyguard and start singing [[bolero]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepi\n* Eva Siva as Luciana \"Luci\"\n* [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]] (Olvido Gara) as Bom\n* F\u00e9lix Rotaeta as Policeman / Juan\n* Concha Gr\u00e9gori as Charito\n* Kiti Manver as Model/singer\n* [[Cecilia Roth]] as Girl in the panties commercial\n* [[Fabio McNamara]] (Fabio de Miguel) as Roxy\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Woman who plays [[The Lady of the Camellias]]\n* Cristina S\u00e1nchez Pascual as Bearded woman\n\nMaura took the leading role of Pepi and F\u00e9lix Rotaeta played the abusive policeman. Both were instrumental in having the film made. Maura was already an established actress, having found film success with [[Fernando Colomo]]'s ''Tigres de Papel''.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo\"/> She became Almod\u00f3var's reference actress in the first half of his career. Bom is played by [[Alaska (singer)|Olvido Gara]], then a teenage [[Punk subculture|punk]] singer, who inspired the character she plays. Gara went on to take the artistic name of Alaska. She has enjoyed a successful artistic career as a singer, first in Alaska and Dinarama and later with [[Fangoria]].<ref name=\"almodovarlandia-entry\">{{cite web | title=Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del mont\u00f3n | url=http://www.almodovarlandia.com/almodovarlandia/movies/filmpepilucibom.htm | accessdate=1 September 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"almodovarlandia-bio\">{{cite web | title=Biography of Pedro Almod\u00f3var | url=http://www.almodovarlandia.com/almodovarlandia/biography.htm | accessdate=1 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nMany actors that appear in minor roles went on to play more important ones in Almod\u00f3var's subsequent films:<ref name = \" Strauss\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var''</ref>{{rp|19}} Kiti Manver (''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'') plays a hot-tempered, Andalusian rock singer; [[Julieta Serrano]] (''[[Dark Habits]]''); [[Cecilia Roth]] (''[[All About My Mother]]''); Fabio MacNamara (''[[Labyrinth of Passion]]''), a singer and painter, plays a transvestite [[Avon Products|Avon]] lady;<ref name = \" Allison\">Allison, ''A Spanish Labyrinth''</ref>{{rp|90}} Cristina S\u00e1nchez Pascual (''[[Dark Habits]]'') appears as a high-pitch bearded woman frustrated in a marriage to a homosexual, in a parody of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|23}} [[Assumpta Serna]] ''([[Matador (film)|Matador]])'' has a non speaking cameo,<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|85}} while Almod\u00f3var himself appears as the host in the general erection contest.\n\n==Production==\n''Pepi, Luci, Bom'' is Almod\u00f3var's first feature film. He had previously made only [[short film]]s in [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]], ''Salome'' a short in 16mm and a feature-length film in super 8 ''Folle, folle, f\u00f3lleme, Tim'' (1978) (Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Tim), none of which had a soundtrack.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nThe genesis of  ''Pepi, Luci, Bom'' was a story written by Almod\u00f3var  called \"General Erections\" published in 1978 in the magazine ''El V\u00edbora'' (''The Viper''). \"General Erections\" was a comic parody of the 1977 general elections in Spain.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|23}} The idea to take that story and develop it into a film was born out of his collaboration with the theatrical group Los Goliardos.<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\">D'Lugo, ''Pedro Almod\u00f3var''</ref>{{rp|19}} Performing with them in a small role in ''Dirty Hands'' by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], Almod\u00f3var met [[Carmen Maura]] and F\u00e9lix Rotaeta, who encouraged him to make a film out of ''General Erections''.<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|20}} Almod\u00f3var rewrote the story and changed the title to \"Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del mont\u00f3n\" (\"Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap\").<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|36}}\n\nThe initial budget was only 500,000 pesetas that Carmen Maura and F\u00e9lix Rotaeta helped to collect.<ref name=\" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|20}} At the time, Almod\u00f3var was working for [[Telef\u00f3nica]], Spain's national telephone company, as an administrative employee therefore the shooting took place on weekends with a group of volunteers.<ref name = \" Strauss\"/>{{rp|22}} Without the backing of a studio, Almod\u00f3var was forced to make extensive use of location shooting.

The crew lacked experience and the cameraman cut off some heads, particularly during the general erections contest scene. The long and chaotic shooting created problems in continuity. When filming started Olvido Gara was fifteen and by the time the filming wrapped she was seventeen.<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|21}} The first scene when Pepi goes to answer the door to the policeman was shot in June 1979, she opened it in December 1979 and they sat together in June 1980.<ref name=\" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|21}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film [[Film premiere|premiered]] on 19 September 1980 at the [[San Sebastian Film Festival]] in the section devoted to new directors.<ref name = \" Smith\">Smith, ''Desire Unlimited''</ref>{{rp|14}}<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|25}} It later toured the independent circuits and then spent four years on the late night showing of the Alphaville Theater in [[Madrid]].\n\nReviews in Spain were mostly negative, objecting to the film's frivolity and vulgar humor.<ref name = \" Pavlovi\u00e1e\"/>{{rp|164}} Pedro Crespo, in the conservative newspaper ABC, described the film a \u201cmerely a variation on the age old tradition of vulgar comedy transformed into a contemporary language\u201d.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|18}} Diego Gal\u00e1n, in ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'', praised the film concluding that \u201cWe are in the presence of an astonishing and up to now, unique work.

The reaction of American critics to the film was, on the whole, hostile. It was generally rebuked for its thematic and formal inconsistency. [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered the film a \u201crough unfunny comedy notable for its bathroom jokes, humorous rape scene and abysmal home movie cinematography\u2019. She found \u201cits humor of a very adolescent variety\u2026 and plot turns that are better described than seen\u201d.<ref name=\"nytimes-review\"/>  Critic Rita Kempley from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it an \u201camateurish directorial debut, a smutty sexual sideshow most safely viewed in a full body condom\u201d.\n\nThe film cost 6 million pesetas (about \u20ac36,000) and made 43 million pesetas (\u20ac260,000) in its initial release in Madrid.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|26}} With its many [[kitsch]] elements, campy style, outrageous humor, and open sexuality, the film became emblematic of a cultural movement of its time, [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]]. It amassed a [[cult following]] and established Almod\u00f3var as an ''[[agent provocateur]]''.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\n==Theme==\nThe central theme of the film \u2013 female resilience, independence, and solidarity \u2013 would be a constant throughout Almod\u00f3var's career, albeit better depicted in his later and more accomplished films. Like the female characters in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', ''[[All About My Mother]]'', and ''[[Volver]]'', Pepi and Bom are self-sufficient, independent and their friendship is shown as more important than any sexual or love attachment.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|23}} By contrast, men are either non-existent or presented unsympathetically like the policeman in ''Pepi, Luci, Bom''; Raimunda's abusive husband in ''Volver'' or Pepa's unfaithful lover in ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''. Although Bom and Luci form a lesbian couple, their story is ultimately less important than Pepi and Bom's friendship. While the friendship of these two remains strong Bom's and Luci affair ends when the latter returns to a heterosexual life of abuse with her husband.\n\nTwo scenes put Pepi and Bom's closeness in the foreground. Contrasting Luci's troubled household, Pepi is presented cooking Bom's favorite dish: Bacalao al pil pil.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|102}} The film aptly closes with the two friends looking ahead to a new life shared together as roommates, helping to support each other. The film also takes on other themes frequent in Almod\u00f3var's filmography: sexual heterodoxy, drug addiction and a love of pop culture.\n\n==Genre==\nAmong Almod\u00f3var's films ''Pepi, Luci, Bom'', his first, is the one who takes more explicitly comedy as a genre. All the others (with the possible exception of ''Los Amantes pasajeros'') incorporate elements of melodrama. The characters are shown as comic archetypes. Pepi is the independent witty modern woman. There is the nasty radical policeman. Bom is shown as a perverse rebellious teenager and Luci as the abused housewife.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|21}}\n\nThe amateurish presentation of the film and its crude humor also sets the film apart from the rest of Almodovar's filmography. Even in ''Labyrinth of Passion'', Almodovar's subsequent film, comic elements are not presented so bluntly. By then, there was also a huge improvement in plot structure and filmography over his first film.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|25}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThe comic book origins of the film are evident in its loose structure, provocative vulgarity and the intertitles made by famous Spanish illustrator, Ceespe, then an unknown member of La Movida Madrile\u00f1a. \nThe film was plagued by financial and technical problems: Almod\u00f3var claimed humorously that \"when a film has only one or two, it is considered an imperfect film, while when there is a profusion of technical flaws, it is called style. That's what I said joking around when I was promoting the film, but I believe 'that that was closer to the truth.\"<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nStylistically the film owes a debt to [[Paul Morrissey]]'s first films and above all to [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]''' [[Pink Flamingos]]''.<ref name = \" Strauss\"/>{{rp|13}} Almod\u00f3var confronts the spectator with unexpected outrageous situations, including a lesbian [[Urolagnia|golden shower]] scene in the middle of a knitting lesson.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|22}}\n\nThe technical and plot defects of the films are apparent, particularly when compared with Almod\u00f3var's subsequent polished and complex works. However the film captured the spirit of its time, La Movida Madrile\u00f1a, presenting [[Madrid]] as an exciting city where anything goes.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\nThe film centers on youth culture, showing it as wild, frivolous, adventurous and free from taboos.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|102}}{{rp|37}}<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|22}} There is political symbolism in the right wing, old macho attitudes of the policeman, who represent the disappearing Francoist society and is presented unsympathetically.<ref name = \" Smith 10\">Smith, ''Desire Unlimited'', p. 10</ref> Pepi and Bom stand for Spain's modern woman, the wild new face of a liberated democratic Spain. Luci is the self-sacrificing Spanish housewife, trapped between the old and new Spain. She is a masochist who yearns for the brutality of the past.\n\nBlurring the limits of sexual identity, transsexual characters appear in many Almod\u00f3var's films.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|95}} Here there is a [[drag queen]] called Roxy, played by Fabio McNamara, Almod\u00f3var's singing partner in a [[glam rock]] parody duo. \nThe comic elements of the film defy good taste and are bluntly presented.<ref name=\" Allison\"/>{{rp|94}} Alm\u00f3dovar does not linger in the oddness of the sexual relationship between a traditional housewife in her forties and a rebellious punk teenager, which is presented without judgment as nothing out of the ordinary. ''Pepi, Luci, Bom'' is clearly an amateurish film; a first-time director, Almod\u00f3var learned his craft as he made it.<ref name=\" Strauss\"/>{{rp|13}}<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|160}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film opens with the song \"Do the Swim\" by [[Nell Campbell|Little Nell]], singing co-star of [[Jim Sharman]]'s cult 1975 film ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|198}} The counterculture song \"Murciana marrana\", written by Fabio McNamara, is prominently featured, performed by Alaska and Los Pegamoides with a mixture of vulgarity and absurdity.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|200}} The film closes with a Latin-American song \"Estaba escrito\" by [[Monna Bell]], a Chilean singer.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|199}}\n\n==DVD release==\n''Pepi, Luci, Bom''  is available in Region 2 DVD in Spanish with English subtitles.

He selects Luci to give him oral sex, which makes her the most envied woman at the party.\n\nEventually Pepi is forced to find work as her father decides to stop her income. She becomes a creative writer for advertising spots designing ads for sweating, menstruating dolls and multipurpose panties that absorb urine and can double as a dildo. Pepi also begins to write a script which will be the story of lesbian lovers Luci and Bom. The [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] policeman is desperately looking for his wife. Meanwhile, he takes advantage of naive neighbor Charito, who is in love with Juan, his twin brother. Pretending to be Juan, the policeman slaps, then sexually assaults Charito.\n\nFinally, the policeman finds Luci coming out of a disco and kidnaps her from her two friends. He gives Luci a terrible beating that sends her to the hospital, where Pepi and Bom visit her. They quickly realize that they have lost Luci. She has decided to return to the person who mistreats her best \u2013 her sadistic and tyrannical husband. His brutality is what Luci has always wanted or became accustomed to. Bruised and bandaged in her hospital bed, Luci tells Bom she is returning to him for a life of abuse. Bom is lost without Luci and laments that pop is also out of fashion. Pepi has the solution to both problems. Bom should move in with Pepi as her bodyguard and start singing [[bolero]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepi\n* Eva Siva as Luciana \"Luci\"\n* [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]] (Olvido Gara) as Bom\n* F\u00e9lix Rotaeta as Policeman / Juan\n* Concha Gr\u00e9gori as Charito\n* Kiti Manver as Model/singer\n* [[Cecilia Roth]] as Girl in the panties commercial\n* [[Fabio McNamara]] (Fabio de Miguel) as Roxy\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Woman who plays [[The Lady of the Camellias]]\n* Cristina S\u00e1nchez Pascual as Bearded woman\n\nMaura took the leading role of Pepi and F\u00e9lix Rotaeta played the abusive policeman.

The reaction of American critics to the film was, on the whole, hostile. It was generally rebuked for its thematic and formal inconsistency. [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered the film a \u201crough unfunny comedy notable for its bathroom jokes, humorous rape scene and abysmal home movie cinematography\u2019. She found \u201cits humor of a very adolescent variety\u2026 and plot turns that are better described than seen\u201d.<ref name=\"nytimes-review\"/>  Critic Rita Kempley from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it an \u201camateurish directorial debut, a smutty sexual sideshow most safely viewed in a full body condom\u201d.\n\nThe film cost 6 million pesetas (about \u20ac36,000) and made 43 million pesetas (\u20ac260,000) in its initial release in Madrid.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|26}} With its many [[kitsch]] elements, campy style, outrageous humor, and open sexuality, the film became emblematic of a cultural movement of its time, [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]]. It amassed a [[cult following]] and established Almod\u00f3var as an ''[[agent provocateur]]''.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\n==Theme==\nThe central theme of the film \u2013 female resilience, independence, and solidarity \u2013 would be a constant throughout Almod\u00f3var\u2019s career, albeit better depicted in his later and more accomplished films. Like the female characters in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', ''[[All About My Mother]]'', and ''[[Volver]]'', Pepi and Bom are self-sufficient, independent and their friendship is shown as more important than any sexual or love attachment.<ref name=\" Edwards\"/>{{rp|23}} By contrast, men are either non-existent or presented unsympathetically like the policeman in ''Pepi, Luci, Bom''; Raimunda\u2019s abusive husband in ''Volver'' or Pepa's unfaithful lover in ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''. Although Bom and Luci form a lesbian couple, their story is ultimately less important than Pepi and Bom\u2019s friendship. While the friendship of these two remains strong Bom's and Luci affair ends when the latter returns to a heterosexual life of abuse with her husband.\n\nTwo scenes put Pepi and Bom's closeness in the foreground. Contrasting Luci's troubled household, Pepi is presented cooking Bom's favorite dish: Bacalao al pil pil.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|102}} The film aptly closes with the two friends looking ahead to a new life shared together as roommates, helping to support each other. The film also takes on other themes frequent in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s filmography: sexual heterodoxy, drug addiction and a love of pop culture.\n\n==Genre==\nAmong Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films ''Pepi, Luci, Bom'', his first, is the one who takes more explicitly comedy as a genre. All the others (with the possible exception of ''Los Amantes pasajeros'') incorporate elements of melodrama. The characters are shown as comic archetypes. Pepi is the independent witty modern woman. There is the nasty radical policeman. Bom is shown as a perverse rebellious teenager and Luci as the abused housewife.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|21}}\n\nThe amateurish presentation of the film and its crude humor also sets the film apart from the rest of Almodovar's filmography. Even in ''Labyrinth of Passion'', Almodovar's subsequent film, comic elements are not presented so bluntly. By then, there was also a huge improvement in plot structure and filmography over his first film.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|25}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThe comic book origins of the film are evident in its loose structure, provocative vulgarity and the intertitles made by famous Spanish illustrator, Ceespe, then an unknown member of La Movida Madrile\u00f1a. \nThe film was plagued by financial and technical problems: Almod\u00f3var claimed humorously that \"when a film has only one or two, it is considered an imperfect film, while when there is a profusion of technical flaws, it is called style. That's what I said joking around when I was promoting the film, but I believe 'that that was closer to the truth.\"<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nStylistically the film owes a debt to [[Paul Morrissey]]'s first films and above all to [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]''' [[Pink Flamingos]]''.<ref name = \" Strauss\"/>{{rp|13}} Almod\u00f3var confronts the spectator with unexpected outrageous situations, including a lesbian [[Urolagnia|golden shower]] scene in the middle of a knitting lesson.<ref name = \" Edwards\"/>{{rp|22}}\n\nThe technical and plot defects of the films are apparent, particularly when compared with Almod\u00f3var's subsequent polished and complex works. However the film captured the spirit of its time, La Movida Madrile\u00f1a, presenting [[Madrid]] as an exciting city where anything goes.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\nThe film centers on youth culture, showing it as wild, frivolous, adventurous and free from taboos.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|102}}{{rp|37}}<ref name = \" D\u2019Lugo\"/>{{rp|22}} There is political symbolism in the right wing, old macho attitudes of the policeman, who represent the disappearing Francoist society and is presented unsympathetically.<ref name = \" Smith 10\">Smith, ''Desire Unlimited'', p. 10</ref> Pepi and Bom stand for Spain's modern woman, the wild new face of a liberated democratic Spain. Luci is the self-sacrificing Spanish housewife, trapped between the old and new Spain. She is a masochist who yearns for the brutality of the past.\n\nBlurring the limits of sexual identity, transsexual characters appear in many Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films.<ref name = \" Allison\"/>{{rp|95}} Here there is a [[drag queen]] called Roxy, played by Fabio McNamara, Almod\u00f3var's singing partner in a [[glam rock]] parody duo. \nThe comic elements of the film defy good taste and are bluntly presented.<ref name=\" Allison\"/>{{rp|94}} Alm\u00f3dovar does not linger in the oddness of the sexual relationship between a traditional housewife in her forties and a rebellious punk teenager, which is presented without judgment as nothing out of the ordinary.

In the AMTEC, [[sodium]] is driven around a closed [[thermodynamic cycle]] between a high-temperature [[heat reservoir]] and a cooler reservoir at the heat rejection temperature. The unique feature of the AMTEC cycle is that sodium ion conduction between a high-pressure or -activity region and a low-pressure or -activity region on either side of a highly ionically conducting refractory solid electrolyte is thermodynamically nearly equivalent to an [[isothermal expansion]] of sodium vapor between the same high and low pressures.  Electrochemical oxidation of neutral sodium at the anode leads to sodium [[ions]], which traverse the solid electrolyte, and [[electron]]s, which travel from the anode through an external circuit, where they perform electrical work, to the low-pressure cathode, where they recombine with the ions to produce low-pressure sodium gas. The sodium gas generated at the cathode then travels to a condenser at the heat-rejection temperature of perhaps 400\u2013700 K, where liquid sodium reforms.  The AMTEC thus is an electrochemical [[concentration cell]], which converts the work generated by expansion of sodium vapor directly into electric power.\n\nThe converter is based on the [[electrolyte]] used in the [[Molten salt battery|sodium\u2013sulfur battery]], sodium beta\u2033-alumina, a crystalline phase of somewhat variable composition containing aluminum oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, in a nominal ratio of 5:1, and a small amount of the oxide of a small-cation metal, usually lithium or magnesium, which stabilizes the beta\u2033 crystal structure. The sodium beta\u2033-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) [[ceramic]] is nearly insulating with respect to transport of electrons and is a thermodynamically stable phase in contact with both liquid sodium and sodium at low pressure.\n\nSingle-cell AMTECs with open voltages as high as 1.55 [[volt|V]] and maximum power density as high as 0.50 [[watt|W]]/[[centimeter|cm]]<sup>2</sup> of solid electrolyte area at a temperature of 1173 K (900&nbsp;\u00b0C) have been obtained with long-term stable refractory metal electrodes.<ref name=\"ref3\">R.

Kummer and Neill Weber at [[Ford]] in 1966, and is described in US Patents {{US patent|3404036|3404036}}, {{US patent|3458356|3458356}}, {{US patent|3535163|3535163}} and {{US patent|4049877|4049877}}. It is a [[Heat engine|thermally regenerative]] [[electrochemical]] device for the direct conversion of [[heat]] to [[electricity|electrical energy]].<ref name=\"ref1\">N.

In the AMTEC, [[sodium]] is driven around a closed [[thermodynamic cycle]] between a high-temperature [[heat reservoir]] and a cooler reservoir at the heat rejection temperature. The unique feature of the AMTEC cycle is that sodium ion conduction between a high-pressure or -activity region and a low-pressure or -activity region on either side of a highly ionically conducting refractory solid electrolyte is thermodynamically nearly equivalent to an [[isothermal expansion]] of sodium vapor between the same high and low pressures.  Electrochemical oxidation of neutral sodium at the anode leads to sodium [[ions]], which traverse the solid electrolyte, and [[electron]]s, which travel from the anode through an external circuit, where they perform electrical work, to the low-pressure cathode, where they recombine with the ions to produce low-pressure sodium gas. The sodium gas generated at the cathode then travels to a condenser at the heat-rejection temperature of perhaps 400\u2013700 K, where liquid sodium reforms.  The AMTEC thus is an electrochemical [[concentration cell]], which converts the work generated by expansion of sodium vapor directly into electric power.\n\nThe converter is based on the [[electrolyte]] used in the [[Molten salt battery|sodium\u2013sulfur battery]], sodium beta\u2033-alumina, a crystalline phase of somewhat variable composition containing aluminum oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, in a nominal ratio of 5:1, and a small amount of the oxide of a small-cation metal, usually lithium or magnesium, which stabilizes the beta\u2033 crystal structure. The sodium beta\u2033-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) [[ceramic]] is nearly insulating with respect to transport of electrons and is a thermodynamically stable phase in contact with both liquid sodium and sodium at low pressure.\n\nSingle-cell AMTECs with open voltages as high as 1.55 [[volt|V]] and maximum power density as high as 0.50 [[watt|W]]/[[centimeter|cm]]<sup>2</sup> of solid electrolyte area at a temperature of 1173 K (900&nbsp;\u00b0C) have been obtained with long-term stable refractory metal electrodes.<ref name=\"ref3\">R.
