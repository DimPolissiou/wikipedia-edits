Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and [[individualism]] as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. <!-- Please do not adjust these dates without raising the matter on the talk page first -->  It was partly a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013060413/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2005 |title=''Romanticism''.

Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.<ref>\"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old Romantics!

The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], \"the artist's feeling is his law\".<ref>Novotny, 96</ref> For [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\", which the poet then \"recollect[s] in tranquility\", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.<ref>From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2</ref>\n\nTo express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from \"artificial\" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination\u2014at least of a good creative artist\u2014would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.<ref>Day, 3</ref> As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.<ref name=\"Ruthven01p40\">Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: \"Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius.\"</ref><ref name=\"Spearing87\">Spearing (1987) quote: \"Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality.\"</ref><ref name=\"Eco94\">Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:\nMuch art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the \"modern\" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of \"creation from nothingness\", with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.</ref> This idea is often called \"romantic originality\".<ref>Waterhouse (1926), throughout; Smith (1924); Millen, Jessica ''Romantic Creativity and the Ideal of Originality: A Contextual Analysis'', in [http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections/vol6/pdf/ch07.pdf ''Cross-sections'', The Bruce Hall Academic Journal \u2013 Volume VI, 2010 PDF]; Forest Pyle, The Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford University Press, 1995) p. 28.</ref> Translator and prominent Romantic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] argued in his ''Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters'' that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=European Romanticism: A Brief History with Documents|last=1963\u2013|first=Breckman, Warren|date=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|others=Rogers D.

This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, \"much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves\".<ref>Day 3\u20134; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied \"a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals\".<ref>Berlin, 92</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century \"romantic\" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), \"I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\"<ref>Ferber, 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\">Ferber, 7</ref>  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\",<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\"/> but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, \"I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago\".<ref>Christiansen, 241.</ref>  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 242.</ref>\n\n===Period===\nThe period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\",<ref>in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1</ref> and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.<ref>Day, 1\u20135</ref> Others have proposed 1780\u20131830.<ref>{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780\u20131830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace & Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1-4130-2253-7|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}</ref> In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946\u201348.<ref>Edward F. Kravitt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpR6Ja9eQzYC&pg=PA47&dq=%22Four+Last+Songs%22+%22Late+Romantic%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FC92T8K_JIWA8gPP3JCeDQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Four%20Last%20Songs%22%20%22Late%20Romantic%22&f=false The Lied: Mirror of Late Romanticism]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1996): 47. {{ISBN|0-300-06365-2}}.</ref> However, in most fields the Romantic period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.\n\nThe early period of the Romantic era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) followed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, \"The Romantic Period \u2013 Volume D\" (New York: W.W. Norton & Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref> The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795\u20131805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been \"conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums\".<ref>Johnson, 147, inc. quotation</ref> According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.<ref>Barzun, 469</ref>\n\n===Context and place in history===\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,<ref>Day, 1\u20133; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].</ref> and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\",<ref>Berlin, 57</ref> and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.<ref>Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34\u201347, 57\u201359, 183\u2013206, 207\u201337.</ref> For the Romantics, Berlin says, <blockquote>in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups\u2014states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice\u2014church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste\u2014is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.<ref>Berlin, 57\u201358</ref><!-- yes, 2 semi-colons & about 15 commas in the quote --></blockquote>\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]\n\n[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],<ref>[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]</ref> and some like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism\u2014a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"\u2014<ref>''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,</ref><ref>[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M.

An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the \"Salon des curiosit\u00e9s Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] in literature and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\n==Literature==\n{{See also|Romantic poetry}}\n[[File:Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Wallis]], ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' 1856, by suicide at 17 in 1770]]\n\nIn literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of \"[[sensibility]]\" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.<ref>[[James Runcieman Sutherland|Sutherland, James]] (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.</ref> The Romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].\n\nSome authors cite 16th-century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered \"an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism\",<ref>Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193</ref> differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].\n\nThe precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref name=\"John Keats page 106\">John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics</ref> Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.<ref name=\"Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11\">Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11</ref> Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759\u201367), introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]\nAn early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]]. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and the [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|brothers]] [[Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.\n\nImportant motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806\u201308.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition=1st |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-90081-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 7\u20138] |url=https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 }}</ref> Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.

The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]\n\nIn contrast, [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron \"undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century\".<ref>Christiansen, 215.</ref> Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four \"Turkish tales\", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the \"[[Byronic hero]]\", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 192\u201396.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]]. The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland, and [[Thomas Moore]] from Ireland, reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.\n\nThough they have modern critical champions such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]''.<ref>Christiansen, 197\u2013200.</ref> Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.<ref>Christiansen, 213\u201320.</ref> Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.\n\nThe most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics such as [[Claudia L. Johnson]] have detected tremors under the surface of many works, such as ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817),''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).<ref>Christiansen, 188\u201389.</ref> But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Bront\u00eb family]] appeared. Most notably [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more Gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.\n\nByron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan \"improvements\" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';<ref>Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689.

[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686\u20131758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].<ref>J.

''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>J.

Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and \"[[Scots Wha Hae]]\" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.<ref>L.

Towards the end of the century there were \"[[closet drama]]s\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762\u20131851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] Romanticism.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30>I.

The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[Ren\u00e9 (novella)|Ren\u00e9]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[The Genius of Christianity|G\u00e9nie du christianisme]]'', 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[M\u00e9moires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' (\"Memoirs from beyond the grave\").<ref>Christiansen, 202\u201303, 241\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The \"battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]\n\nAfter the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that \"Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington\" (\"Shakespeare is [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]]\").<ref>Christiansen, 239\u201346, 240 quoted.</ref> [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\u2014a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.<ref>Christiansen, 244\u201346.</ref> Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play ''Cromwell'' gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that \"there are no rules, or models\". The career of [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] and several others;<ref>Christiansen</ref> she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].\n\nFrench Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[G\u00e9rard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.\n\n[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wa\u0144kowicz]], 1828]]\n{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}\n[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.<ref>Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183</ref> Polish Romanticism revived the old \"Sarmatism\" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.<ref>Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760\u20131850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742</ref> Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the \"[[Great Emigration]]\", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n[[File:Juliusz S\u0142owacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|\"Three National Bards\" of Polish literature]]\u2014a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]\n\nTheir art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].\n\n[[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedia''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&oldid=41481531|language = pl}}</ref> (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy'') and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion''), as well as in the later ''Psalmy przysz\u0142o\u015bci'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.\n\n=== Russia ===\nEarly Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820\u20131821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825\u20131832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799\u20131837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecker]].\n\nInfluenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio Mar\u00eda Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])<ref>{{cite web |title=El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}</ref>]]\n[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]] and the dramatists [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] and [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Quintana]].<ref>Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13</ref>  The plays of [[Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures.

Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Cam\u00f5es''{{'}} preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']].

In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' (\"A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]\"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Lu\u00eds de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a \"Romantic drama\" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' (\"Traditional Portuguese Ballads\") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as \"romances\" or \"rimances\", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett \u2013 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=Jo\u00e3o Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-972-48-0192-6|location=Porto|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Almeida Garrett|last=Infop\u00e9dia|website=Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rios Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\">{{Cite book|title=Hist\u00f3ria da literatura portuguesa|last=Jos\u00e9.|first=Saraiva, Ant\u00f3nio|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-972-0-30170-3|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism.

He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play.

His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.\n\nBrazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gon\u00e7alves Dias]], renowned by the poem \"[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do ex\u00edlio]]\" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[\u00c1lvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]]. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes [[Castro Alves]], [[Tobias Barreto]] and [[Pedro Lu\u00eds Pereira de Sousa]].<ref>Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda and Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Brazilian Literature'' (1996) vol. 2 p. 367</ref>\n[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dennis Malone Carter]], ''Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat'', 1878.

American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by \"[[noble savage]]s\", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque \"local color\" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]\u2014nearly unread in her own time\u2014and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.\n\n====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====\nThe European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\">George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613</ref>\n\nRomanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\"/><ref>\"Romanticism, American\", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t238.e1140 online]</ref>\n\nAmerican Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.<ref>The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem \"[[Another Weeping Woman]]\" and its commentary.</ref>\n\nThe works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nRomantic architecture appeared in the late 18th century in a reaction against the rigid forms of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architecture. reached its peak in the mid-19th century, and continued to appear until the end of the 19th century. It was designed to evoke an emotional reaction, either respect for tradition or nostalgia for a bucolic past. It was frequently inspired by the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]], especially [[Gothic architecture]], It was strongly influenced by romanticism in literature, particularly the historical novels of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Walter Scott]]. It sometimes moved into the domain of [[eclecticism]], with features assembled from different historic periods and regions of the world.<ref>Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Gothic Revival architecture]] was a popular variant of the romantic style, particularly in the construction of churches, Cathedrals, and university buildings. Notable examples include the completion of [[Cologne Cathedral]] in Germany, by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The cathedral had been begun in 1248, but work was halted in 1473. The original plans for the fa\u00e7ade were discovered in 1840, and it was decided to recommence. Schinkel followed the original design as much as possible, but used modern construction technology, including an iron frame for the roof. The building was finished in 1880.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64</ref>\n\nIn Britain, notable examples include the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]], a romantic version of traditional [[Indian architecture]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823), and the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, built in a Gothic revival style by [[Charles Barry]] between 1840 and 1876.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn France, one of the earliest examples of romantic architecture is the [[Hameau de la Reine]], the small rustic hamlet created at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the romantic painter [[Hubert Robert]]. It consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in [[Normandy]]. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing at being peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.{{Sfn|Saule|2014|page=92}}\n\nFrench romantic architecture in the 19th century was strongly influenced by two writers; [[Victor Hugo]], whose novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' inspired a resurgence in interest in the Middle Ages; and [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], who wrote celebrated romantic novels and short stories and was also the first head of the commission of Historic Monuments in France, responsible for publicizing and restoring (and sometimes romanticizing) many French cathedrals and monuments desecrated and ruined after the [[French Revolution]]. His projects were carried out by the architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. These included the restoration (sometimes creative) of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the fortified city of [[Carcassonne]], and the unfinished medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]].<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\"/><ref>Poisson, Georges; ''Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc'' (in French) (2014)</ref>\n\nThe romantic style continued in the second half of the 19th century. The [[Palais Garnier]], the Paris opera house designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] was a highly romantic and eclectic combination of artistic styles.  Another notable example of late 19th century romanticism is the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]], who drew upon the model of [[Byzantine architecture]] for his elongated domes (1875\u20131914).<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\"/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125\">\nFile:Marie Antoinette amusement at Versailles.JPG|[[Hameau de la Reine]], [[Palace of Versailles]] (1783\u20131785)\nFile:Brighton royal pavilion Qmin.jpg|[[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823)\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|[[Cologne Cathedral]] (1840\u201380)\nFile:Monumental stairway of the palais Garnier opera in Paris.jpg|Grand Staircase of the [[Paris Opera]] by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1861\u201375)\nFile:Le sacre coeur.jpg|[[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]] (1875\u20131914)\n</gallery>\n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]\n\nIn the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest \"six-footers\" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up\u2014challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]], a [[Rococo|late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to. Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, \"making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death\".<ref>Novotny, 96\u2013101, 99 quoted</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800\u201302]]\n\nOther groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th-century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.<ref>Novotny, 112\u201321</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\".<ref>Honour, 184\u2013190, 187 quoted</ref> A new generation of the French school,<ref>Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.</ref> developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] (1791\u20131824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly \"[[history painting]]\", literally \"story painting\", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] was called \"the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\".<ref>Novotny, 142</ref>  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.<ref>Novotny, 133\u201342</ref> But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.<ref>Hughes, 279\u201380</ref> He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.\n[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Pr\u00e9ault]], [[Pont d'I\u00e9na]], Paris]]\n\n[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture\u2014with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]\u2014<ref>McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995</ref> rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]].

Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri R\u00e9voil]] (1776\u20131842) and [[Fleury-Fran\u00e7ois Richard]] (1777\u20131852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].<ref>Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124\u2013155</ref>\n\n[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]\n\nAnother trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791\u20131882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]]. His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of \"Troubadour\" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[Rococo|late Baroque]] Italian masters.\n\nLiterary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[William Cullen Bryant|W. C. Bryant]]'s poem ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.\n\nSome American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the \"[[noble savage]]\" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Childhood, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|[[Thomas Cole]], ''[[The Voyage of Life#Childhood|Childhood]]'', one of the four scenes in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'', 1842\nFile:William Blake - Albion Rose - from A Large Book of Designs 1793-6.jpg|[[William Blake]], ''[[Albion (Blake)|Albion]] Rose'', 1794\u201395\nFile:Le poeme de lAme-14-Louis Janmot-MBA Lyon-IMG 0497.jpg|[[Louis Janmot]], from his series ''The Poem of the Soul'', before 1854\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Old Age, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|Thomas Cole, 1842, ''The Voyage of Life<br />[[The Voyage of Life#Old Age|Old Age]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|Romantic music|Musical nationalism|List of Romantic-era composers}}\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\nMusical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon\u2014so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of \"The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism\".<ref>Boyer 1961, 585.</ref> Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally \"can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians\", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], \"a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect\". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, \"whether by imitation or by reaction\", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful \"perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters\".<ref>Ferchault 1957.</ref>\n[[File:NiccoloPaganini.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Portrait of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'', 1819]]\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in 1838 by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]]]\n\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''M\u00e9moires'' of [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try]].<ref>Gr\u00e9tre 1789.</ref> This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\">Samson 2001.</ref> In 1810 [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] named [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\".<ref>Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.</ref> This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.<ref>Boyer 1961, 585\u201386.</ref>\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"<ref>Wagner 1995, 77.</ref>\n\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])\u2014itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age\u2014attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, [[Robert Schumann]], Hector Berlioz and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/>\n\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]<ref>Einstein 1947.</ref> to extend the musical \"[[Romantic music|Romantic era]]\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Warrack 2002.</ref> and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout]]'s ''History of Western Music''<ref>Grout 1960, 492.</ref> but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949\u201386), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre-World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].<ref>Blume 1970; Samson 2001.</ref> This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/> and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.<ref>Wehnert 1998.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|[[Felix Mendelssohn]], 1839\nFile:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|[[Robert Schumann]], 1839\nFile:Barabas-liszt.jpg|[[Franz Liszt]], 1847\nFile:Postcard-1910 Daniel Fransois Auber.jpg|[[Daniel Auber]], c. 1868\nFile:Hector Berlioz.jpg|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1850\nFile:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|[[Giovanni Boldini]], ''Portrait of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'', 1886\nFile:Richardwagner1.jpg|[[Richard Wagner]], c. 1870s\nFile:Giacomo Meyerbeer nuorempana.jpg|[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], 1847\n</gallery>\n\nIn the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers.

Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required \"an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response\".<ref>Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.</ref> He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature. Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism. It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.<ref>Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed.

Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97668-3}}</ref>   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].

Example of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]\n\nOne of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.\n\nEarly Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau, and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address \"To the German Nation\" in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality\u2014then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.<ref name=\"Fichte\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref> ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brunhild|Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===\n[[File:Night november.jpg|thumb|The [[November Uprising]] (1830\u201331), in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], against the [[Russian Empire]]]]\n\nRomanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a \"[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]\" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (directed against the Russians), where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote \"Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters\". In ''Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage'' Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of the poem.

Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.<ref>\"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old Romantics!

The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], \"the artist's feeling is his law\".<ref>Novotny, 96</ref> For [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\", which the poet then \"recollect[s] in tranquility\", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.<ref>From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2</ref>\n\nTo express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from \"artificial\" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination\u2014at least of a good creative artist\u2014would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.<ref>Day, 3</ref> As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.<ref name=\"Ruthven01p40\">Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: \"Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius.\"</ref><ref name=\"Spearing87\">Spearing (1987) quote: \"Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality.\"</ref><ref name=\"Eco94\">Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:\nMuch art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the \"modern\" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of \"creation from nothingness\", with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.</ref> This idea is often called \"romantic originality\".<ref>Waterhouse (1926), throughout; Smith (1924); Millen, Jessica ''Romantic Creativity and the Ideal of Originality: A Contextual Analysis'', in [http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections/vol6/pdf/ch07.pdf ''Cross-sections'', The Bruce Hall Academic Journal \u2013 Volume VI, 2010 PDF]; Forest Pyle, The Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford University Press, 1995) p. 28.</ref> Translator and prominent Romantic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] argued in his ''Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters'' that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=European Romanticism: A Brief History with Documents|last=1963\u2013|first=Breckman, Warren|date=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|others=Rogers D.

This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, \"much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves\".<ref>Day 3\u20134; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied \"a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals\".<ref>Berlin, 92</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century \"romantic\" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), \"I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\"<ref>Ferber, 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\">Ferber, 7</ref>  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\",<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\"/> but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, \"I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago\".<ref>Christiansen, 241.</ref>  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 242.</ref>\n\n===Period===\nThe period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\",<ref>in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1</ref> and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.<ref>Day, 1\u20135</ref> Others have proposed 1780\u20131830.<ref>{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780\u20131830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace & Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1-4130-2253-7|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}</ref> In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946\u201348.<ref>Edward F. Kravitt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpR6Ja9eQzYC&pg=PA47&dq=%22Four+Last+Songs%22+%22Late+Romantic%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FC92T8K_JIWA8gPP3JCeDQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Four%20Last%20Songs%22%20%22Late%20Romantic%22&f=false The Lied: Mirror of Late Romanticism]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1996): 47. {{ISBN|0-300-06365-2}}.</ref> However, in most fields the Romantic period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.\n\nThe early period of the Romantic era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) followed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, \"The Romantic Period \u2013 Volume D\" (New York: W.W. Norton & Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref> The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795\u20131805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been \"conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums\".<ref>Johnson, 147, inc. quotation</ref> According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.<ref>Barzun, 469</ref>\n\n===Context and place in history===\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,<ref>Day, 1\u20133; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].</ref> and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\",<ref>Berlin, 57</ref> and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.<ref>Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34\u201347, 57\u201359, 183\u2013206, 207\u201337.</ref> For the Romantics, Berlin says, <blockquote>in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups\u2014states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice\u2014church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste\u2014is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.<ref>Berlin, 57\u201358</ref><!-- yes, 2 semi-colons & about 15 commas in the quote --></blockquote>\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]\n\n[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],<ref>[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]</ref> and some like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism\u2014a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"\u2014<ref>''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,</ref><ref>[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M.

An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the \"Salon des curiosit\u00e9s Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] in literature and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\n==Literature==\n{{See also|Romantic poetry}}\n[[File:Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Wallis]], ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' 1856, by suicide at 17 in 1770]]\n\nIn literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of \"[[sensibility]]\" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.<ref>[[James Runcieman Sutherland|Sutherland, James]] (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1.

By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics</ref> Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.<ref name=\"Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11\">Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11</ref> Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759\u201367), introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]\nAn early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]]. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and the [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|brothers]] [[Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.\n\nImportant motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806\u201308.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition=1st |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-90081-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 7\u20138] |url=https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 }}</ref> Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.

The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]\n\nIn contrast, [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron \"undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century\".<ref>Christiansen, 215.</ref> Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four \"Turkish tales\", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the \"[[Byronic hero]]\", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 192\u201396.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]]. The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland, and [[Thomas Moore]] from Ireland, reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.\n\nThough they have modern critical champions such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]''.<ref>Christiansen, 197\u2013200.</ref> Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.<ref>Christiansen, 213\u201320.</ref> Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.\n\nThe most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics such as [[Claudia L. Johnson]] have detected tremors under the surface of many works, such as ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817),''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).<ref>Christiansen, 188\u201389.</ref> But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Bront\u00eb family]] appeared. Most notably [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more Gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.\n\nByron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan \"improvements\" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';<ref>Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689.

[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686\u20131758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].<ref>J.

''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>J.

Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement.

Towards the end of the century there were \"[[closet drama]]s\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762\u20131851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] Romanticism.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30>I.

The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[Ren\u00e9 (novella)|Ren\u00e9]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[The Genius of Christianity|G\u00e9nie du christianisme]]'', 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[M\u00e9moires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' (\"Memoirs from beyond the grave\").<ref>Christiansen, 202\u201303, 241\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The \"battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]\n\nAfter the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that \"Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington\" (\"Shakespeare is [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]]\").<ref>Christiansen, 239\u201346, 240 quoted.</ref> [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\u2014a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.<ref>Christiansen, 244\u201346.</ref> Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play ''Cromwell'' gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that \"there are no rules, or models\". The career of [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] and several others;<ref>Christiansen</ref> she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].\n\nFrench Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[G\u00e9rard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.\n\n[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wa\u0144kowicz]], 1828]]\n{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}\n[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.<ref>Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183</ref> Polish Romanticism revived the old \"Sarmatism\" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.<ref>Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760\u20131850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742</ref> Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the \"[[Great Emigration]]\", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n[[File:Juliusz S\u0142owacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|\"Three National Bards\" of Polish literature]]\u2014a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]\n\nTheir art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].\n\n[[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority.

However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820\u20131821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825\u20131832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799\u20131837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecker]].\n\nInfluenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio Mar\u00eda Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])<ref>{{cite web |title=El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}</ref>]]\n[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]] and the dramatists [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] and [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Quintana]].<ref>Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13</ref>  The plays of [[Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosal\u00eda de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixen\u00e7a]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.<ref>Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364</ref>\n\nThere are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a \"metaphysical crisis\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8153-3563-4|location=New York|page=78}}</ref> These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after.

Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Cam\u00f5es''{{'}} preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Sta\u00ebl, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' (\"A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]\"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Lu\u00eds de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a \"Romantic drama\" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' (\"Traditional Portuguese Ballads\") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as \"romances\" or \"rimances\", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett \u2013 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=Jo\u00e3o Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-972-48-0192-6|location=Porto|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Almeida Garrett|last=Infop\u00e9dia|website=Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rios Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\">{{Cite book|title=Hist\u00f3ria da literatura portuguesa|last=Jos\u00e9.|first=Saraiva, Ant\u00f3nio|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-972-0-30170-3|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism.

He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presb\u00edtero'' (\"Eurico, the Priest\") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' (\"Legends and Narratives\").

He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and [[J\u00falio Dinis]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio Augusto Soares de Passos|Soares de Passos]], Bulh\u00e3o Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\"/>\n\nRomantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the [[Portuguese Renaissance]], such as [[Teixeira de Pascoaes|Teixeira de Pascoais]], [[Jaime Cortes\u00e3o]], M\u00e1rio Beir\u00e3o, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\"/>\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Isabella di Morra.jpg|thumb|Italian poet [[Isabella di Morra]], sometimes cited as a precursor of Romantic poets<ref>Gaetana Marrone, Paolo Puppa, ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A\u2013J'', [[Taylor & Francis]], 2007, p. 1242</ref>]]\nRomanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement although some important works were produced; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called \"Sulla maniera e l'utilit\u00e0 delle traduzioni\", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries.

His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.\n\nBrazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gon\u00e7alves Dias]], renowned by the poem \"[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do ex\u00edlio]]\" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[\u00c1lvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]]. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes [[Castro Alves]], [[Tobias Barreto]] and [[Pedro Lu\u00eds Pereira de Sousa]].<ref>Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda and Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Brazilian Literature'' (1996) vol. 2 p. 367</ref>\n[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dennis Malone Carter]], ''Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat'', 1878.

American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by \"[[noble savage]]s\", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque \"local color\" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]\u2014nearly unread in her own time\u2014and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.\n\n====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====\nThe European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\">George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613</ref>\n\nRomanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\"/><ref>\"Romanticism, American\", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t238.e1140 online]</ref>\n\nAmerican Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.<ref>The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem \"[[Another Weeping Woman]]\" and its commentary.</ref>\n\nThe works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nRomantic architecture appeared in the late 18th century in a reaction against the rigid forms of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architecture. reached its peak in the mid-19th century, and continued to appear until the end of the 19th century. It was designed to evoke an emotional reaction, either respect for tradition or nostalgia for a bucolic past. It was frequently inspired by the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]], especially [[Gothic architecture]], It was strongly influenced by romanticism in literature, particularly the historical novels of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Walter Scott]]. It sometimes moved into the domain of [[eclecticism]], with features assembled from different historic periods and regions of the world.<ref>Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Gothic Revival architecture]] was a popular variant of the romantic style, particularly in the construction of churches, Cathedrals, and university buildings. Notable examples include the completion of [[Cologne Cathedral]] in Germany, by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The cathedral had been begun in 1248, but work was halted in 1473. The original plans for the fa\u00e7ade were discovered in 1840, and it was decided to recommence. Schinkel followed the original design as much as possible, but used modern construction technology, including an iron frame for the roof. The building was finished in 1880.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64</ref>\n\nIn Britain, notable examples include the [[Royal Pavillion]] in [[Brighton]], a romantic version of traditional [[Indian architecture]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823), and the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, built in a Gothic revival style by [[Charles Barry]] between 1840 and 1876.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn France, one of the earliest examples of romantic architecture is the [[Hameau de la Reine]], the small rustic hamlet created at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the romantic painter [[Hubert Robert]]. It consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in [[Normandy]]. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing at being peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.{{Sfn|Saule|2014|page=92}}\n\nFrench romantic architecture in the 19th century was strongly influenced by two writers; [[Victor Hugo]], whose novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' inspired a resurgence in interest in the Middle Ages; and [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], who wrote celebrated romantic novels and short stories and was also the first head of the commission of Historic Monuments in France, responsible for publicizing and restoring (and sometimes romanticizing) many French cathedrals and monuments desecrated and ruined after the [[French Revolution]]. His projects were carried out by the architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. These included the restoration (sometimes creative) of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the fortified city of [[Carcassonne]], and the unfinished medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]].<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\"/><ref>Poisson, Georges; ''Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc'' (in French) (2014)</ref>\n\nThe romantic style continued in the second half of the 19th century. The [[Palais Garnier]], the Paris opera house designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] was a highly romantic and eclectic combination of artistic styles.  Another notable example of late 19th century romanticism is the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]], who drew upon the model of [[Byzantine architecture]] for his elongated domes (1875\u20131914).<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\"/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125\">\nFile:Marie Antoinette amusement at Versailles.JPG|[[Hameau de la Reine]], [[Palace of Versailles]] (1783\u20131785)\nFile:Brighton royal pavilion Qmin.jpg|[[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823)\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|[[Cologne Cathedral]] (1840\u201380)\nFile:Monumental stairway of the palais Garnier opera in Paris.jpg|Grand Staircase of the [[Paris Opera]] by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1861\u201375)\nFile:Le sacre coeur.jpg|[[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]] (1875\u20131914)\n</gallery>\n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]\n\nIn the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest \"six-footers\" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up\u2014challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]], a [[Rococo|late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to. Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, \"making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death\".<ref>Novotny, 96\u2013101, 99 quoted</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800\u201302]]\n\nOther groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th-century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.<ref>Novotny, 112\u201321</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\".<ref>Honour, 184\u2013190, 187 quoted</ref> A new generation of the French school,<ref>Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.</ref> developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] (1791\u20131824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly \"[[history painting]]\", literally \"story painting\", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] was called \"the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\".<ref>Novotny, 142</ref>  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.<ref>Novotny, 133\u201342</ref> But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.<ref>Hughes, 279\u201380</ref> He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.\n[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Pr\u00e9ault]], [[Pont d'I\u00e9na]], Paris]]\n\n[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture\u2014with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]\u2014<ref>McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995</ref> rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]. Pr\u00e9ault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Pr\u00e9ault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.<ref>Novotny, 397, 379\u201384</ref> In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', 1814\nFile:JEAN LOUIS TH\u00c9ODORE G\u00c9RICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|[[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', 1819\nFile:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830\nFile:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|[[J.

Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri R\u00e9voil]] (1776\u20131842) and [[Fleury-Fran\u00e7ois Richard]] (1777\u20131852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].<ref>Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124\u2013155</ref>\n\n[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]\n\nAnother trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791\u20131882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]]. His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of \"Troubadour\" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[Rococo|late Baroque]] Italian masters.\n\nLiterary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[William Cullen Bryant|W. C. Bryant]]'s poem ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.\n\nSome American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the \"[[noble savage]]\" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Childhood, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|[[Thomas Cole]], ''[[The Voyage of Life#Childhood|Childhood]]'', one of the four scenes in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'', 1842\nFile:William Blake - Albion Rose - from A Large Book of Designs 1793-6.jpg|[[William Blake]], ''[[Albion (Blake)|Albion]] Rose'', 1794\u201395\nFile:Le poeme de lAme-14-Louis Janmot-MBA Lyon-IMG 0497.jpg|[[Louis Janmot]], from his series ''The Poem of the Soul'', before 1854\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Old Age, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|Thomas Cole, 1842, ''The Voyage of Life<br />[[The Voyage of Life#Old Age|Old Age]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|Romantic music|Musical nationalism|List of Romantic-era composers}}\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\nMusical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon\u2014so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of \"The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism\".<ref>Boyer 1961, 585.</ref> Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally \"can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians\", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], \"a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect\". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, \"whether by imitation or by reaction\", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful \"perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters\".<ref>Ferchault 1957.</ref>\n[[File:NiccoloPaganini.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Portrait of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'', 1819]]\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in 1838 by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]]]\n\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''M\u00e9moires'' of [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try]].<ref>Gr\u00e9tre 1789.</ref> This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\">Samson 2001.</ref> In 1810 [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] named [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\".<ref>Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.</ref> This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.<ref>Boyer 1961, 585\u201386.</ref>\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"<ref>Wagner 1995, 77.</ref>\n\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])\u2014itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age\u2014attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, [[Robert Schumann]], Hector Berlioz and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/>\n\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]<ref>Einstein 1947.</ref> to extend the musical \"[[Romantic music|Romantic era]]\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Warrack 2002.</ref> and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout]]'s ''History of Western Music''<ref>Grout 1960, 492.</ref> but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949\u201386), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre-World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].<ref>Blume 1970; Samson 2001.</ref> This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/> and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.<ref>Wehnert 1998.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|[[Felix Mendelssohn]], 1839\nFile:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|[[Robert Schumann]], 1839\nFile:Barabas-liszt.jpg|[[Franz Liszt]], 1847\nFile:Postcard-1910 Daniel Fransois Auber.jpg|[[Daniel Auber]], c. 1868\nFile:Hector Berlioz.jpg|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1850\nFile:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|[[Giovanni Boldini]], ''Portrait of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'', 1886\nFile:Richardwagner1.jpg|[[Richard Wagner]], c. 1870s\nFile:Giacomo Meyerbeer nuorempana.jpg|[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], 1847\n</gallery>\n\nIn the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers.

Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required \"an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response\".<ref>Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.</ref> He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature. Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism. It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.<ref>Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed.

Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97668-3}}</ref>   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].

Example of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]\n\nOne of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.\n\nEarly Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau, and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address \"To the German Nation\" in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality\u2014then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.<ref name=\"Fichte\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref> ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brunhild|Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===\n[[File:Night november.jpg|thumb|The [[November Uprising]] (1830\u201331), in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], against the [[Russian Empire]]]]\n\nRomanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a \"[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]\" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (directed against the Russians), where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote \"Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters\". In ''Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage'' Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of the poem. Zdzis\u0142aw K\u0119pi\u0144ski, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.\n\n==Gallery==\n;Emerging Romanticism in the 18th century\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Shipwrec-vernet.jpg|[[Joseph Vernet]], 1759, ''Shipwreck''; the 18th-century \"sublime\"\nFile:Joseph Wright 004.jpg|[[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1774, ''Cave at evening'', [[Smith College|Smith College Museum of Art]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]\nFile:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|[[Henry Fuseli]], 1781, ''[[The Nightmare]]'', a classical artist whose themes often anticipate the Romantic\nFile:Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg d.

After high school, he applied to West Point, like his father, but was unsuccessful.

He was the commander of the [[3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division|3rd Brigade]] of the 1st Cavalry Division, and the Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Maneuver (later Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Support) of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in Germany. He deployed as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] from July 1996 to August 1997. He and the Rear Command Post staff were based in [[Slavonski Brod]], Croatia. Casey took command of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in July 1999.\n\nAfter relinquishing command of the division in July 2001, Casey served in a senior staff position in [[the Pentagon]] as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5), the [[Joint Staff]] from October 2001 to January 2003. His next position was [[Director of the Joint Staff]] in Washington, D.C. from January 2003 to October 2003. Following these assignments, Casey was nominated and confirmed as the 30th [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Vice Chief of Staff of the Army]], serving in that post until June 2004.\n\n===Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq===\nCasey served as the senior coalition commander in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2007.

For his part as a military commander, he focused on training Iraqi forces, limiting the role of American forces, and transferring the burden for providing security to Iraqi forces. Meanwhile, [[Foreign Service Officer|U.S. diplomats]] would focus on building and strengthening the Iraqi government and help the Iraqis hold elections. He expressed his view that a large and intrusive American presence in Iraq would not solve the political and security problems in that country and could even fuel the insurgency.\n\nIn 2005, Casey was hopeful that the [[December 2005 Iraqi elections]] could lead to a more unified and moderate Iraq which\u2014in conjunction with the training of Iraqi security forces\u2014could pave the way for U.S. troop reductions in early 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070716/1a_iedcoverxx.art.htm|title=Pentagon balked at pleas from officers in field for safer vehicles- Iraqi troops got MRAPs; Americans waited |author=Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook |work=USA Today |date=July 16, 2007}}</ref> In August 2005, Casey used specific troop numbers in his public discussion of a possible drawdown. He said the troop level of 138,000 could be reduced by 30,000 in the early months of 2006 as Iraqi security forces took on a greater role. President [[George W. Bush]] publicly called the talk \"speculation\" and rebuked the general. The bombing of the [[al-Askari Mosque]], a sacred [[Shia]] religious site in [[Samarra]], is believed to have stoked sectarian tensions and derailed coalition plans to speedily transfer significant security responsibility to the Iraqi government by the end of 2006.<ref name=Telegraph_20050814>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1496197/Bush-slaps-down-top-general-after-he-calls-for-troops-to-be-pulled-out-of-Iraq.html |title=Bush slaps down top general after he calls for troops to be pulled out of Iraq |accessdate=2010-01-30|author=Sherwell, Philip |date=August 14, 2005 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113130646/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fwirq14.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fixworld.html |archivedate=November 13, 2005 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Casey implied his opposition to a [[troop surge]]:\n\n{{quote|... the longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.

Casey officially succeeded General [[Peter Schoomaker]] as Chief of Staff of the Army on April 10, 2007.\n\nAs the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 2007 to 2011, Casey led what is arguably the world's largest and most complex organization\u20141.1&nbsp;million people strong, with a $200+ billion annual budget\u2014during one of the most extraordinary periods in military and global political history. He became Chief of Staff of an Army that was stretched from 6 years of continuous war. Over his tenure he stabilized and transformed the army to meet the challenges of the 21st century while continuing to meet the demands of two wars. Casey transformed an army trained and prepared for conventional war, to an agile force more suited to modern challenges.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCasey accelerated the growth of the army, instituted Retention Bonuses for young officers, increased the funding for soldier and family programs, improved the way the army cared for its wounded soldiers and surviving family members and drove down the stigma associated with behavioral health counseling to stabilize an army stretched by war. He also improved the leadership training for the army's General Officer Corps, advanced the transformation of the army's business and decision making processes, moved the army onto a rotational deployment program much like the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps']] and oversaw a substantial improvement in the capabilities of the Army National Guard and Army Reserves.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] committed by United States Army psychiatrist [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], Casey expressed concern about jumping to conclusions before the investigation was completed, telling CNN's [[John King (journalist)|John King]] that \"this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers\" and \"As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/08/casey-im-concerned-about-possible-backlash-against-muslim-soldiers/?fbid=N63XSrE7Gga |title=Casey: I'm 'concerned' about backlash against Muslim soldiers |date=8 November 2009 |publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Several months later, in a February 2010 interview, Casey said: \"Our diversity not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.

He was the commander of the [[3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division|3rd Brigade]] of the 1st Cavalry Division, and the Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Maneuver (later Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Support) of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in Germany. He deployed as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] from July 1996 to August 1997. He and the Rear Command Post staff were based in [[Slavonski Brod]], Croatia. Casey took command of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in July 1999.\n\nAfter relinquishing command of the division in July 2001, Casey served in a senior staff position in [[the Pentagon]] as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5), the [[Joint Staff]] from October 2001 to January 2003. His next position was [[Director of the Joint Staff]] in Washington, D.C. from January 2003 to October 2003.

For his part as a military commander, he focused on training Iraqi forces, limiting the role of American forces, and transferring the burden for providing security to Iraqi forces. Meanwhile, [[Foreign Service Officer|U.S. diplomats]] would focus on building and strengthening the Iraqi government and help the Iraqis hold elections. He expressed his view that a large and intrusive American presence in Iraq would not solve the political and security problems in that country and could even fuel the insurgency.\n\nIn 2005, Casey was hopeful that the [[December 2005 Iraqi elections]] could lead to a more unified and moderate Iraq which\u2014in conjunction with the training of Iraqi security forces\u2014could pave the way for U.S. troop reductions in early 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070716/1a_iedcoverxx.art.htm|title=Pentagon balked at pleas from officers in field for safer vehicles- Iraqi troops got MRAPs; Americans waited |author=Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook |work=USA Today |date=July 16, 2007}}</ref> In August 2005, Casey used specific troop numbers in his public discussion of a possible drawdown. He said the troop level of 138,000 could be reduced by 30,000 in the early months of 2006 as Iraqi security forces took on a greater role. President [[George W. Bush]] publicly called the talk \"speculation\" and rebuked the general. The bombing of the [[al-Askari Mosque]], a sacred [[Shia]] religious site in [[Samarra]], is believed to have stoked sectarian tensions and derailed coalition plans to speedily transfer significant security responsibility to the Iraqi government by the end of 2006.<ref name=Telegraph_20050814>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1496197/Bush-slaps-down-top-general-after-he-calls-for-troops-to-be-pulled-out-of-Iraq.html |title=Bush slaps down top general after he calls for troops to be pulled out of Iraq |accessdate=2010-01-30|author=Sherwell, Philip |date=August 14, 2005 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113130646/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fwirq14.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fixworld.html |archivedate=November 13, 2005 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Casey implied his opposition to a [[troop surge]]:\n\n{{quote|... the longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.

Casey officially succeeded General [[Peter Schoomaker]] as Chief of Staff of the Army on April 10, 2007.\n\nAs the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 2007 to 2011, Casey led what is arguably the world's largest and most complex organization\u20141.1&nbsp;million people strong, with a $200+ billion annual budget\u2014during one of the most extraordinary periods in military and global political history. He became Chief of Staff of an Army that was stretched from 6 years of continuous war. Over his tenure he stabilized and transformed the army to meet the challenges of the 21st century while continuing to meet the demands of two wars. Casey transformed an army trained and prepared for conventional war, to an agile force more suited to modern challenges.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCasey accelerated the growth of the army, instituted Retention Bonuses for young officers, increased the funding for soldier and family programs, improved the way the army cared for its wounded soldiers and surviving family members and drove down the stigma associated with behavioral health counseling to stabilize an army stretched by war. He also improved the leadership training for the army's General Officer Corps, advanced the transformation of the army's business and decision making processes, moved the army onto a rotational deployment program much like the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps']] and oversaw a substantial improvement in the capabilities of the Army National Guard and Army Reserves.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] committed by United States Army psychiatrist [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], Casey expressed concern about jumping to conclusions before the investigation was completed, telling CNN's [[John King (journalist)|John King]] that \"this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers\" and \"As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/08/casey-im-concerned-about-possible-backlash-against-muslim-soldiers/?fbid=N63XSrE7Gga |title=Casey: I'm 'concerned' about backlash against Muslim soldiers |date=8 November 2009 |publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Several months later, in a February 2010 interview, Casey said: \"Our diversity not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.

Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. It admits students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects discussion in class are sometimes very intens and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usual offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=November 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{original research|date=September 2007}}\n{{Copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n|name                   = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena\n|native_name            =\n|latin_name             =\n|logo                   =\n|seal_image             =\n|image                  = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena.jpg\n|image_size             =\n|alt                    =\n|caption                =\n|motto                  =\n|motto_translation      =\n|location               =\n|streetaddress          = Erich-Kuithan-Str. 7\n|region                 =\n|city                   = [[Jena]]\n|state                  = [[Thuringia]]\n|province               =\n|county                 =\n|postcode               =\n|postalcode             =\n|zipcode                =\n|country                = Germany\n|country1               =\n|coordinates            = {{Coord|50|57|08|N|11|36|33|E|region:DE_type:edu_source:dewiki|display=inline,title}}\n|schooltype             =\n|fundingtype            =\n|type                   = German elite [[Gymnasium school|''Gymnasium'']] for maths, science, and technology\n|religious_affiliation  =\n|religion               =\n|denomination           =\n|patron                 =\n|established            = 1963\n|founded                =\n|opened                 =\n|founder                =\n|status                 =\n|closed                 =\n|locale                 =\n|schoolboard            =\n|district               =\n|LEA                    =\n|authority              =\n|category               =\n|category_label         =\n|oversight              =\n|oversight_label        =\n|authorizer             =\n|superintendent         =\n|trustee                =\n|specialist             =\n|session                =\n|schoolnumber           =\n|school code            =\n|MOE                    =\n|ofsted                 =\n|ceeb                   =\n|president              =\n|chair                  =\n|chairman               =\n|chairperson            =\n|dean                   =\n|administrator          =\n|rector                 =\n|director               =\n|principal              = Dr. Carsten M\u00fcller\n|principal_label        =\n|principal1             =\n|principal2             =\n|principal3             =\n|principal4             =\n|viceprincipal          =\n|viceprincipal_label    =\n|viceprincipal1         =\n|viceprincipal2         =\n|viceprincipal3         =\n|viceprincipal4         =\n|asst principal         =\n|assistant_principals   =\n|campus director        =\n|headmistress           =\n|headmaster             =\n|head of school         =\n|head_teacher           =\n|executive_headteacher  =\n|acting_headteacher     =\n|head                   =\n|head_label             =\n|chaplain               =\n|custodian              =\n|staff                  =\n|faculty                =\n|teaching_staff         =\n|employees              =\n|key_people             =\n|grades                 =\n|years                  =\n|gender                 = [[Coeducational]]\n|lower_age              =\n|upper_age              =\n|age range              =\n|enrollment              = ca. 500\n|website                = {{URL|http://carl-zeiss-gymnasium.de/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' is a state-funded German elite [[Gymnasium school|Gymnasium]] ''(grammar school)'' for highly gifted students in the fields of math, science, and technology. Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. It admits students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]].

[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] walks by an overturned Tiger II. The overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rim roadwheel arrangement is visible.]]\nThe Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives.

Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers.

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side. On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this is presumably at the ideal 90 degrees angle.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Kingtiger Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=185532282X|pages=34\u201336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATawrvkJBAUC&pg=PA35}}</ref> Some sources {{who|date=July 2018}} claimed that there is no proof that the glacis armour of the Tiger II was ever penetrated in combat.<ref>{{cite web |title = PzKpfw VI Tiger II |url = http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/tiger2.htm |work = The Armor Site! |publisher=Fabio Prado |accessdate = 23 November 2015}}</ref>{{better source|fprado.com is a tertiary source with unknown editorial oversight|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe expanded firing test states that the [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420]] projectiles from the [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B's turret at ranges of 1000\u20131500 metres, which suggests a quality factor of 0.86 for the Tiger Ausf B's turret. The firing test against the Tiger B turret front, however, was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings, such as vision slits and gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100&nbsp;mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics - Armour and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=90|<!-- accessdate=22 January 2015 -->}}</ref> Some {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the tank's hull and turret side plates were penetrated by [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420 shot]] from domestic 85&nbsp;mm and American 76&nbsp;mm guns at ranges of {{convert|800|-|2000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} The [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500\u2013600 metres after 3\u20134 shots.<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref>\n\nSome {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the large 122&nbsp;mm OF-471 (\u041e\u0424-471) [[High explosive|HE]] projectiles, equipped with a 3.8&nbsp;kg [[TNT]] charge, would easily crack and could even completely tear off the front armor plate at the seam weld, blow off the turret and driver sprocket<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA41&dq=is-2+powerful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsremgMvSAhUIU7wKHaX5DswQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=is-2%20powerful&f=false The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Chris Bishop, P. 41]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}, mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks without any armor penetration<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RLjQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=122mm+shell+effect&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=122mm%20shell%20effect&f=false Soviet Heavy Tanks: World War 2 In Review Special]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\n[[File:Koenigstiger Saumur F.jpg|thumb|alt=The side of a large tank with wide, wavy green and grey striped camouflage, as it drives past, the commander sitting in the cupola.|The working Tiger II of the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' being displayed to the public, 2005]]The only working example is displayed at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]]'', [[Saumur]], France.

Another design contract followed in 1939, and was given to [[Ferdinand Porsche|Porsche]].<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\">Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3.</ref> Both prototype series used the same turret design from [[Krupp]]; the main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Chambois1.jpg|thumb|left|[[SHAEF]] commander Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] walks by an overturned Tiger II. The overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rim roadwheel arrangement is visible.]]\nThe Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Munster Koenigstiger Porscheturm Modell detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank turret with a front face which curves up and down.

The rough [[Zimmerit]] coating is evident, used to prevent magnetic mines from adhering to the tank's armour.]]\n\nHenschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17</ref> Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the Tiger II (P), after the \"Porsche\" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their [[VK 4502 (P)|prototype]]; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes.<ref name=\":0\" /> This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs\u2014slightly more than the 1,347 [[Tiger I]] tanks produced\u2014but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids.<ref name=\"Manchester68-498\">Manchester 1968, p. 498.</ref> Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant.

The 503rd then took part in the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. The 503rd remained in the Hungarian theater of operations for 166 days, during which it accounted for at least 121 Soviet tanks, 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, five aircraft and a train. This was set against the loss of 25 Tiger IIs; ten were knocked out by Soviet troops and burned out, two were sent back to Vienna for a factory overhaul, while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons, usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. [[Kurt Knispel]], the highest scoring tank ace of all time (162 enemy [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s destroyed), also served with the 503rd, and was killed in action on 29 April 1945 in his Tiger II.<ref name=\"Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber147\">Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber, 2000. p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was also used in significant numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] (also known as the Battle of the Bulge) of December 1944.<ref>Schneider 2005, pp. 214\u2013216.</ref> At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, nearly a third of total production, and most were lost during the course of the offensive.<ref>Green, Michael. \"German Tanks of World War II\".

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side. On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this is presumably at the ideal 90 degrees angle.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Kingtiger Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=185532282X|pages=34\u201336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATawrvkJBAUC&pg=PA35}}</ref> Some sources {{who|date=July 2018}} claimed that there is no proof that the glacis armour of the Tiger II was ever penetrated in combat.<ref>{{cite web |title = PzKpfw VI Tiger II |url = http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/tiger2.htm |work = The Armor Site! |publisher=Fabio Prado |accessdate = 23 November 2015}}</ref>{{better source|fprado.com is a tertiary source with unknown editorial oversight|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe expanded firing test states that the [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420]] projectiles from the [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B's turret at ranges of 1000\u20131500 metres, which suggests a quality factor of 0.86 for the Tiger Ausf B's turret. The firing test against the Tiger B turret front, however, was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings, such as vision slits and gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100&nbsp;mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics - Armour and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=90|<!-- accessdate=22 January 2015 -->}}</ref> Some {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the tank's hull and turret side plates were penetrated by [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420 shot]] from domestic 85&nbsp;mm and American 76&nbsp;mm guns at ranges of {{convert|800|-|2000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} The [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500\u2013600 metres after 3\u20134 shots.<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref>\n\nSome {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the large 122&nbsp;mm OF-471 (\u041e\u0424-471) [[High explosive|HE]] projectiles, equipped with a 3.8&nbsp;kg [[TNT]] charge, would easily crack and could even completely tear off the front armor plate at the seam weld, blow off the turret and driver sprocket<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA41&dq=is-2+powerful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsremgMvSAhUIU7wKHaX5DswQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=is-2%20powerful&f=false The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Chris Bishop, P. 41]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}, mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks without any armor penetration<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RLjQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=122mm+shell+effect&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=122mm%20shell%20effect&f=false Soviet Heavy Tanks: World War 2 In Review Special]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\n[[File:Koenigstiger Saumur F.jpg|thumb|alt=The side of a large tank with wide, wavy green and grey striped camouflage, as it drives past, the commander sitting in the cupola.|The working Tiger II of the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' being displayed to the public, 2005]]The only working example is displayed at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]]'', [[Saumur]], France.

Hospitals with intermediate numbers of patients had outcomes between these extremes. [[ICU delirium]], formerly and inaccurately referred to as ICU psychosis, is a syndrome common in intensive care and cardiac units where patients who are in unfamiliar, monotonous surroundings develop symptoms of delirium (Maxmen & Ward, 1995).

US board certification in critical care medicine is available through all five specialty boards.  Intensivists with a primary training in internal medicine sometimes pursue combined fellowship training in another subspecialty such as pulmonary medicine, cardiology, infectious disease, or nephrology.  The American  [[Society of Critical Care Medicine]] is a well-established multiprofessional society for practitioners working in the ICU including nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians. Most medical research has demonstrated that ICU care provided by intensivists produces better outcomes and more cost-effective care.<ref>\"Association between Critical Care Physician Management and Patient Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit\".  ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]''. 3 June 2008. Volume 148, Issue 11. pp. 801\u2013809.</ref> This has led the [[Leapfrog Group]] to make a primary recommendation that all ICU patients be managed or co-managed by a dedicated intensivist who is exclusively responsible for patients in one ICU. \n\nIn Australia, the training in intensive care medicine is through College of Intensive Care Medicine.\n\nIn the UK doctors can only enter intensive care medicine training after completing two foundation years, and core training in either emergency medicine, anaesthetics, acute medicine or core medicine. Most trainees dual train with one of these specialties however it has recently become possible to train purely in intensive care medicine. It has also possible to train in sub-specialties of intensive care medicine including pre-hospital emergency medicine. \n\n=== Nursing ===\nNurses that work in the critical care setting are typically registered nurses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of critical care|others=Hall, Jesse B.,, Schmidt, Gregory A.,, Kress, John P.|isbn=9780071738811|edition=Fourth|location=New York|oclc=906700899|date = 2 June 2015}}</ref> [[Nurse]]s may pursue additional education and training in critical care medicine leading to certification as a CCRN by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses a standard that was begun in 1975.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Pediatric critical care|others=Fuhrman, Bradley P.,, Zimmerman, Jerry J.,, Clark, Robert S.
