The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html top 10 best games]''' through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html creating a game world best top games in the word]''' and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. ''Control'' was released on 27 August 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jeff |first1=Cork |title=Control Is Coming Out This August |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/21/control-is-coming-out-this-august |website=Game Informer |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with some gaming publications naming it one of the top 10 games of 2019. ''Control'' was followed by a downloadable expansion, ''The Foundation'', which was released on March 26, 2020.

As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

They range from standard humans carrying firearms to heavily mutated variations which possess a variety of superpowers. Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Control'' revolves around a clandestine U.S. government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which is responsible for the investigation of \"paranatural\" phenomena which defy the known laws of reality. These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

During the war years, [[Pratt & Whitney]] continued to develop new ideas to upgrade the engine, including [[water injection (engines)|water injection]] for takeoff in cargo and passenger planes and to give emergency power in combat.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nFirst run in 1937,<ref name=P&W>[http://www.pw.utc.com/about_us/classic_engines/r2800_double_wasp.asp]</ref> near the time that the larger (54.9 litres) competing 18-cylinder [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright Duplex-Cyclone]]'s development had been started (May of that year), the 46-liter displacement R-2800 was first-flown by 1940, one year before the Duplex-Cyclone. The Double Wasp was more powerful than the world's only other modern 18-cylinder engine, the [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 18L]] of 3,442&nbsp;in\u00b3 (56.4&nbsp;L). {{#tag:ref|The American [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright Duplex-Cyclone]] radial of 3,347&nbsp;in\u00b3 (54.86&nbsp;L) was also under development at the time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.468thbombgroup.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sPINPiUsDfI%3D&tabid=36&mid=467 |title=B-29 Design/Devemopment - Engines |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=468thbombgroup.org |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref> and promised to be more powerful than either the P&W or Gnome-Rhone radials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enginehistory.org/NoShortDays/Introduction.pdf |title=No Short Days - The Struggle to Develop the R-2800 \"Double Wasp\" Crankshaft - Introduction |last=McCutcheon |first=Kimble |date= |website= |publisher=enginehistory.org |page=4 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>|group=nb}} The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins.<ref name=avhist>[http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/pr-2800.htm Pratt and Whitney R-2800] The Aviation History Online Museum.

The design of conventional air-cooled radial engines had become so scientific and systematic by then, that the Double Wasp was introduced with a smaller incremental power increase than was typical of earlier engines. Nevertheless, in 1941 the power output of production models increased to {{convert|2100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and to {{convert|2400|hp|kW|abbr=on}} late in the war. Even more was coaxed from experimental models, with fan-cooled subtypes like the R-2800-57 producing {{convert|2800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, but in general the R-2800 was a rather highly developed powerplant right from the beginning.<ref name=avhist/>\n\n[[File:XF4U-1 NACA 1940.jpeg|thumb|right|The first prototype F4U Corsair, the earliest aircraft specifically designed to use the Double Wasp]]\n\nThe R-2800 powered several types of fighters and medium bombers during the war, including the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] [[Vought F4U Corsair]], with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.f4ucorsair.com/history.html |title=Chance Vought F4U Corsair - XF4U-1 - Genesis |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=f4ucorsair.com |publisher=f4ucorsair.com |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713093920/http://www.f4ucorsair.com/history.html |archivedate=July 13, 2013 }}</ref> in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.f4ucorsair.com/history.html |title=Chance Vought F4U Corsair - XF4U-1 - Testing |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=f4ucorsair.com |publisher=f4ucorsair.com |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713093920/http://www.f4ucorsair.com/history.html |archivedate=July 13, 2013 }}</ref> and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed 400&nbsp;mph (640&nbsp;km/h) in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair's naval rival, the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]], the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces']] [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] (which uniquely, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric [[turbocharger]]), the twin-engine [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] and [[Douglas A-26 Invader]], as well as the first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]]. When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher [[octane rating]] ([[Engine knocking|anti-knock]] value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of {{convert|2800|hp|kW|abbr=on}} on [[Octane rating|115-grade]] fuel with water injection.<ref name=avhist/>\n\nAfter World War II, the engine was used in the [[Korean War]], and surplus World War II aircraft powered by the Double Wasp served with other countries well past the Korean War, some being retired as late as the latter part of the 1960s when the aircraft were replaced.<ref name=utc>[http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=3c6ff3b8f77fb010VgnVCM1000000881000aRCRD Pratt & Whitney R-2800 page] Retrieved: 25 October 2008</ref>\n\n===Peacetime===\nEngines grow in power with development, but a major war demands the utmost performance from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service was unlikely to exceed 50 hours flying, over a period of only a month or two. In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800's reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the [[Douglas DC-6]], [[Martin 4-0-4]], and [[Convair 240]] transports. The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] and the first [[Lockheed Constellation|Constellations]].<ref name=avhist/>\n\nToday, three-quarters of a century after the first prototype Double Wasp, it still flies in restored vintage [[warbird]] aircraft displayed at [[air show]]s, and sees service worldwide on aircraft such as the [[Canadair CL-215]] water-bomber. In addition, R-2800s continue to power DC-6 cargo and fuel-carrying aircraft in locations such as [[Alaska]].

Power ratings quoted are usually maximum \"military\" power that the engine could generate on takeoff and at altitude: 100 Octane fuel was used, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe R-2800 was developed and modified into a basic sequence of subtypes, \"A\" through \"E\" series, each of which indicated major internal and external modifications and improvements, such that the \"E\" series engines had very few parts in common with the \"A\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n;Note:Suffixes such as '''-S14A-G''' denote engines developed for export to other countries.\n\n''Data from White (Airlife)<ref>White 2001 225-292.</ref> unless otherwise noted:''\n\n===Military===\n;Notes:\nThe dash number for each military type (e.g.: '''-21''') was allocated to identify the complete engine model in accordance with the specification under which the engine was manufactured, thus it did not necessarily indicate the sequence in which the engines were manufactured; for example: the -18W was a \"C\" series engine, built from 1945, whereas the -21 was a \"B\" series engine, built from 1943.\n\nUntil 1940 the armed forces adhered strictly to the convention that engines built for the Army Air Forces used engine model numbers with odd numeric suffixes (e.g.: -5), while those built for the US Navy used even (e.g.: -8). After 1940, however, in the interests of standardization, engines were sometimes built to a joint Army-Navy contract, in which case the engines used a common numeric suffix (e.g.: the -10 was used by both Army and Naval aircraft.)\n\nThe suffix '''W''' e.g.: '''-10W''' denotes a sub-series modified to use [[Water injection (engines)|A.D.I Anti-Detonant Injection or water injection]] equipment, using various mixes of water and [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) injected into the carburetor to increase power for short periods: several models of R-2800s were fitted as standard with A.D.I and did not use the '''W''' suffix.{{#tag:ref|P&W authorised the use of 50% methanol, 50% water or combinations of 60% methyl-40% water; or 25% methyl-25% [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]-50% water; or 60% methol-39% water plus 1% anti-corrosive oil.<ref>White 2001, p. 218.</ref>|group=nb}} Few commercial aircraft used water injection.\n\n''\"A\" Series:''\n* '''R-2800-1'''\n: 1,500&nbsp;hp  (1,118&nbsp;kW) at 2,400&nbsp;rpm at {{convert|7,500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins.<ref name=avhist>[http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/pr-2800.htm Pratt and Whitney R-2800] The Aviation History Online Museum.

When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher [[octane rating]] ([[Engine knocking|anti-knock]] value) to give considerably more power.

In addition, R-2800s continue to power DC-6 cargo and fuel-carrying aircraft in locations such as [[Alaska]]. A total of 125,334 R-2800 engines were produced between 1939 and 1960.<ref name=P&W/>\n\n==Variants==\nThis is a list of representative R-2800 variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Double-Wasp. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum \"military\" power that the engine could generate on takeoff and at altitude: 100 Octane fuel was used, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe R-2800 was developed and modified into a basic sequence of subtypes, \"A\" through \"E\" series, each of which indicated major internal and external modifications and improvements, such that the \"E\" series engines had very few parts in common with the \"A\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n;Note:Suffixes such as '''-S14A-G''' denote engines developed for export to other countries.\n\n''Data from White (Airlife)<ref>White 2001 225-292.</ref> unless otherwise noted:''\n\n===Military===\n;Notes:\nThe dash number for each military type (e.g.: '''-21''') was allocated to identify the complete engine model in accordance with the specification under which the engine was manufactured, thus it did not necessarily indicate the sequence in which the engines were manufactured; for example: the -18W was a \"C\" series engine, built from 1945, whereas the -21 was a \"B\" series engine, built from 1943.\n\nUntil 1940 the armed forces adhered strictly to the convention that engines built for the Army Air Forces used engine model numbers with odd numeric suffixes (e.g.: -5), while those built for the US Navy used even (e.g.: -8). After 1940, however, in the interests of standardization, engines were sometimes built to a joint Army-Navy contract, in which case the engines used a common numeric suffix (e.g.: the -10 was used by both Army and Naval aircraft.)\n\nThe suffix '''W''' e.g.: '''-10W''' denotes a sub-series modified to use [[Water injection (engines)|A.D.I Anti-Detonant Injection or water injection]] equipment, using various mixes of water and [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) injected into the carburetor to increase power for short periods: several models of R-2800s were fitted as standard with A.D.I and did not use the '''W''' suffix.{{#tag:ref|P&W authorised the use of 50% methanol, 50% water or combinations of 60% methyl-40% water; or 25% methyl-25% [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]-50% water; or 60% methol-39% water plus 1% anti-corrosive oil.<ref>White 2001, p. 218.</ref>|group=nb}} Few commercial aircraft used water injection.\n\n''\"A\" Series:''\n* '''R-2800-1'''\n: 1,500&nbsp;hp  (1,118&nbsp;kW) at 2,400&nbsp;rpm at {{convert|7,500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Harrison's backing musicians on the song include [[Eric Clapton]] and the entire [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]] band, with whom he had toured during the final months of [[the Beatles]]. Harrison co-produced the recording with [[Phil Spector]], whose [[Wall of Sound]] production also employed a prominent string arrangement by [[John Barham]] and multiple acoustic rhythm guitars, played by Harrison's fellow [[Apple Records]] signings [[Badfinger]].\n\nAn uptempo composition in the [[Soul music|soul]] genre, \"What Is Life\" is one of several Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at both a woman and a deity. Harrison wrote the song in 1969 and originally intended it as a track for his friend and Apple prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Billy Preston]] to record. Built around a descending [[guitar riff]], it is one of Harrison's most popular compositions and was a regular inclusion in his live performances. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine has variously described it as a \"classic\"<ref name=\"RS 500 Albums\" /> and an \"exultant song of surrender\".<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" />\n\n\"What Is Life\" has appeared in the soundtrack for feature films such as ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'' (1998), ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999), ''[[Away We Go (film)|Away We Go]]'' (2009), ''[[This Is 40]]'' (2012) and ''[[Instant Family]]'' (2018). Harrison's original recording was included on the compilations ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' and ''[[Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison|Let It Roll]]'', and live versions appear on his album ''[[Live in Japan (George Harrison album)|Live in Japan]]'' (1992) and in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]''. In 1972, [[Olivia Newton-John]] had a UK hit with her version of the song. [[Ronnie Aldrich]], [[the Ventures]] and [[Shawn Mullins]] are among the other artists who have covered the track.\n\n==Background and composition==\nEven before his temporary departure from [[the Beatles]] in January 1969 (documented in the song \"[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]\"),<ref>Rodriguez, p. 379.</ref> their [[Apple Records]] label was an \"emancipating force\" for Harrison from the creative restrictions imposed on him within the band, according to his musical biographer, Simon Leng.<ref>Leng, pp. 55, 85.</ref> In his \"definitive\" article on ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' for ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] has written of Harrison's \"journey\" as a solo artist beginning in November 1968 \u2013 when he spent time in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]] \u2013 and incorporating a series of other collaborations through the following eighteen months, including various Apple projects and a support role on [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Friends' brief European tour.<ref>Harris, pp. 68\u201373.</ref> One of these projects, carried out intermittently from April to July 1969,<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 80.</ref> was his production of ''[[That's the Way God Planned It]]'', an album by [[Billy Preston]], whom Harrison had met during the Beatles' [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Hamburg years]] and had recently recruited to guest on the band's troubled [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|''Get Back'']] sessions.<ref name=\"Irvin/Mojo p 82\">Jim Irvin, \"Close to the Edge\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', December 2003, p. 82.</ref><ref>[http://applerecords.com/#!/albums/Album_EncouragingWords \"Encouraging Words\"], [[Apple Records]] (retrieved 16 February 2012).</ref> It was while driving up to a Preston session in London from his [[Kinfauns (Surrey)|home]] in [[Esher|Esher, Surrey]], that Harrison came up with the song \"What Is Life\".<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\">Spizer, p. 222.</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine (book)|I, Me, Mine]]'', Harrison describes it as having been written \"very quickly\" and recalls that he thought it would be a perfect, \"catchy pop song\" for Preston to record.<ref name=\"IMM p 162\">George Harrison, p. 162.</ref> His lyrics, while simple, were similarly uplifting and universal:<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\">Inglis, p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" />\n\n{{quote|''What I feel, I can't say <br> But my love is there for you any time of day <br> But if it's not love that you need <br> Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed. <br> <br>Tell me, what is my life without your love? <br> And tell me, who am I without you, by my side?''}}\n\nThese lyrics have caused some debate among biographers and music critics, as to whether \"What Is Life\" should be viewed as a straightforward love song \u2013 perhaps a \"lovingly crafted paen\" to Harrison's wife [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie]], as [[Alan Clayson]] puts it<ref>Clayson, p. 298.</ref> \u2013 or a [[devotional song]] like many of Harrison's compositions.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" /><ref>Allison, p. 158.</ref> Ian Inglis writes that the song title suggests a \"philosophical debate about the meaning of life\", yet its rendering as \"''what is my life''\" in the choruses \"reshapes [the meaning] completely\".<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\" /> Theologian [[Dale Allison]] finds no religious content in \"What Is Life\" but notes the \"failure of words to express feelings\" implied in the opening line (\"''What I feel, I can't say''\"), a recurring theme of Harrison's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] songs such as \"[[That Is All (song)|That Is All]]\", \"[[Mystical One]]\" and \"[[Pisces Fish]]\".<ref>Allison, pp. 124, 158.</ref> Joshua Greene, another religious academic, identifies the song as part of its parent album's \"intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey\": where \"[[Awaiting on You All]]\" shows Harrison \"convinced of his union with God\", \"What Is Life\" reveals him to be \"uncertain that he deserved such divine favor\".<ref>Greene, p. 181.</ref>\n\nThe song's second verse repeats what Inglis refers to as the \"somewhat confusing promise\" from Harrison (in lines 3 and 4) should his love be \"rejected\":<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\" />\n\n{{quote|''What I know, I can do <br> If I give my love out to everyone like you <br> But if it's not love that you need <br> Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed.''}}\n\nMusically, Simon Leng describes \"What Is Life\" as \"[[Motown]]-spiced\" and a comparatively rare example of its composer's willingness to embrace the role of \"entertainer\" in his songwriting.<ref>Leng, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn ''I Me Mine'', Harrison recalls that he changed his mind about offering \"What Is Life\" to Preston once he'd arrived at [[Olympic Studios]] and found the singer busy working on more typical material \u2013 or \"playing his funky stuff\" as Harrison puts it.<ref name=\"IMM p 162\" /><ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" /> Rather than attempt it with the Beatles during the band's concurrent ''[[Abbey Road]]'' sessions, he stockpiled the track with his many other unused songs from the period \u2013 \"[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]\", \"[[Let It Down]]\", \"[[I'd Have You Anytime]]\" and \"[[Run of the Mill (George Harrison song)|Run of the Mill]]\" among them<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 187.</ref> \u2013 and revisited it a year later, after completing work on Preston's second Apple album, ''[[Encouraging

as well as participating in the \"[[blue-eyed soul]]\"<ref>Clayson, p. 274.</ref> Delaney & Bonnie European tour, along with [[Eric Clapton]], the previous December, Harrison was well placed to record \"What Is Life\", Leng observes.<ref name=\"Leng p 88\">Leng, p. 88.</ref> With [[Phil Spector]] as co-producer and all the Friends team on hand, the song was among the first tracks taped for Harrison's debut post-Beatles solo album;<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter p 429\" /> recording took place at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, during late May or early June.<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter

97\u201398, 99.</ref>\n\nThe recording is defined by Harrison's descending, [[distortion (music)|fuzztone]] guitar [[riff]],<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" /> which also serves as the [[motif (music)|motif]] for the chorus.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\">Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/song/what-is-life-t743156 \"George Harrison 'What Is Life'\"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 22 February 2012).</ref> The track opens with this riff,<ref name=\"Gallucci/UCR\" /> which is then joined by Radle's bass and \"churning\" rhythm guitar from Clapton, before Gordon's drums bring the full band in.<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" /><ref name=\"Leng p 87\" /> During the verses, Gordon moves to a square, Motown-style beat \u2013 or \"rock-steady [[Northern soul]] [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]]\" in Leng's words<ref name=\"Leng p 88\" /> \u2013 before returning to the \"galloping rhythm\" of the more open, \"knockout\" choruses,<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" /> and the song is driven equally by [[Badfinger]] drummer [[Mike Gibbins]]' powerful tambourine work.<ref name=\"Clayson p 296\" />\n\nOn \"What Is Life\", Spector provided what music critic [[David Fricke]] terms \"echo-drenched theater\", in the form of [[reverberation|reverb]]-heavy brass, soaring strings (arranged by [[John Barham]]) and \"a choir of multitracked Harrisons\".<ref name=\"Eds

In many countries, it was issued as the second [[single (music)|single]] from the album, in February 1971, becoming a top-ten hit in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, and topping singles charts in Australia and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, \"What Is Life\" appeared as the [[B-side]] to \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", which was the best-selling single there of 1971. Harrison's backing musicians on the song include [[Eric Clapton]] and the entire [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]] band, with whom he had toured during the final months of [[the Beatles]]. Harrison co-produced the recording with [[Phil Spector]], whose [[Wall of Sound]] production also employed a prominent string arrangement by [[John Barham]] and multiple acoustic rhythm guitars, played by Harrison's fellow [[Apple Records]] signings [[Badfinger]].\n\nAn uptempo composition in the [[Soul music|soul]] genre, \"What Is Life\" is one of several Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at both a woman and a deity. Harrison wrote the song in 1969 and originally intended it as a track for his friend and Apple prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Billy Preston]] to record. Built around a descending [[guitar riff]], it is one of Harrison's most popular compositions and was a regular inclusion in his live performances. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine has variously described it as a \"classic\"<ref name=\"RS 500 Albums\" /> and an \"exultant song of surrender\".<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" />\n\n\"What Is Life\" has appeared in the soundtrack for feature films such as ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'' (1998), ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999), ''[[Away We Go (film)|Away We Go]]'' (2009), ''[[This Is 40]]'' (2012) and ''[[Instant Family]]'' (2018). Harrison's original recording was included on the compilations ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' and ''[[Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison|Let It Roll]]'', and live versions appear on his album ''[[Live in Japan (George Harrison album)|Live in Japan]]'' (1992) and in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]''. In 1972, [[Olivia Newton-John]] had a UK hit with her version of the song. [[Ronnie Aldrich]], [[the Ventures]] and [[Shawn Mullins]] are among the other artists who have covered the track.\n\n==Background and composition==\nEven before his temporary departure from [[the Beatles]] in January 1969 (documented in the song \"[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]\"),<ref>Rodriguez, p. 379.</ref> their [[Apple Records]] label was an \"emancipating force\" for Harrison from the creative restrictions imposed on him within the band, according to his musical biographer, Simon Leng.<ref>Leng, pp. 55, 85.</ref> In his \"definitive\" article on ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' for ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] has written of Harrison's \"journey\" as a solo artist beginning in November 1968 \u2013 when he spent time in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]] \u2013 and incorporating a series of other collaborations through the following eighteen months, including various Apple projects and a support role on [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Friends' brief European tour.<ref>Harris, pp. 68\u201373.</ref> One of these projects, carried out intermittently from April to July 1969,<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 80.</ref> was his production of ''[[That's the Way God Planned It]]'', an album by [[Billy Preston]], whom Harrison had met during the Beatles' [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Hamburg years]] and had recently recruited to guest on the band's troubled [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|''Get Back'']] sessions.<ref name=\"Irvin/Mojo p 82\">Jim Irvin, \"Close to the Edge\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', December 2003, p. 82.</ref><ref>[http://applerecords.com/#!/albums/Album_EncouragingWords \"Encouraging Words\"], [[Apple Records]] (retrieved 16 February 2012).</ref> It was while driving up to a Preston session in London from his [[Kinfauns (Surrey)|home]] in [[Esher|Esher, Surrey]], that Harrison came up with the song \"What Is Life\".<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\">Spizer, p. 222.</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine (book)|I, Me, Mine]]'', Harrison describes it as having been written \"very quickly\" and recalls that he thought it would be a perfect, \"catchy pop song\" for Preston to record.<ref name=\"IMM p 162\">George Harrison, p. 162.</ref> His lyrics, while simple, were similarly uplifting and universal:<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\">Inglis, p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" />\n\n{{quote|''What I feel, I can't say <br> But my love is there for you any time of day <br> But if it's not love that you need <br> Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed. <br> <br>Tell me, what is my life without your love? <br> And tell me, who am I without you, by my side?''}}\n\nThese lyrics have caused some debate among biographers and music critics, as to whether \"What Is Life\" should be viewed as a straightforward love song \u2013 perhaps a \"lovingly crafted paen\" to Harrison's wife [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie]], as [[Alan Clayson]] puts it<ref>Clayson, p. 298.</ref> \u2013 or a [[devotional song]] like many of Harrison's compositions.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" /><ref>Allison, p. 158.</ref> Ian Inglis writes that the song title suggests a \"philosophical debate about the meaning of life\", yet its rendering as \"''what is my life''\" in the choruses \"reshapes [the meaning] completely\".<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\" /> Theologian [[Dale Allison]] finds no religious content in \"What Is Life\" but notes the \"failure of words to express feelings\" implied in the opening line (\"''What I feel, I can't say''\"), a recurring theme of Harrison's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] songs such as \"[[That Is All (song)|That Is All]]\", \"[[Mystical One]]\" and \"[[Pisces Fish]]\".<ref>Allison, pp. 124, 158.</ref> Joshua Greene, another religious academic, identifies the song as part of its parent album's \"intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey\": where \"[[Awaiting on You All]]\" shows Harrison \"convinced of his union with God\", \"What Is Life\" reveals him to be \"uncertain that he deserved such divine favor\".<ref>Greene, p. 181.</ref>\n\nThe song's second verse repeats what Inglis refers to as the \"somewhat confusing promise\" from Harrison (in lines 3 and 4) should his love be \"rejected\":<ref name=\"Inglis p 26\" />\n\n{{quote|''What I know, I can do <br> If I give my love out to everyone like you <br> But if it's not love that you need <br> Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed.''}}\n\nMusically, Simon Leng describes \"What Is Life\" as \"[[Motown]]-spiced\" and a comparatively rare example of its composer's willingness to embrace the role of \"entertainer\" in his songwriting.<ref>Leng, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn ''I Me Mine'', Harrison recalls that he changed his mind about offering \"What Is Life\" to Preston once he'd arrived at [[Olympic Studios]] and found the singer busy working on more typical material \u2013 or \"playing his funky stuff\" as Harrison puts it.<ref name=\"IMM p 162\" /><ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" /> Rather than attempt it with the Beatles during the band's concurrent ''[[Abbey Road]]'' sessions, he stockpiled the track with his many other unused songs from the period \u2013 \"[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]\", \"[[Let It Down]]\", \"[[I'd Have You Anytime]]\" and \"[[Run of the Mill (George Harrison song)|Run of the Mill]]\" among them<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 187.</ref> \u2013 and revisited it a year later, after completing work on Preston's second Apple album, ''[[Encouraging Words]]''.<ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 426.</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nBy May 1970, having recently collaborated with \"genuine [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] heavy-weights\" such as [[Doris Troy]] and Preston, as well as participating in the \"[[blue-eyed soul]]\"<ref>Clayson, p. 274.</ref> Delaney & Bonnie European tour, along with [[Eric Clapton]], the previous December, Harrison was well placed to record \"What Is Life\", Leng observes.<ref name=\"Leng p 88\">Leng, p. 88.</ref> With [[Phil Spector]] as co-producer and all the Friends team on hand, the song was among the first tracks taped for Harrison's debut post-Beatles solo album;<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter p 429\" /> recording took place at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, during late May or early June.<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter p 429\" /><ref>Badman, p. 10.</ref> The same core of musicians \u2013 [[Bobby Whitlock]], [[Carl Radle]], [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], [[Bobby Keys]] and [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]] \u2013 would similarly elevate other ''All Things Must Pass'' tracks such as \"Awaiting on You All\", \"[[Art of Dying (song)|Art of Dying]]\" and \"[[Hear Me Lord]]\".<ref>Leng, pp. 95\u201396, 97\u201398, 99.</ref>\n\nThe recording is defined by Harrison's descending, [[distortion (music)|fuzztone]] guitar [[riff]],<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" /> which also serves as the [[motif (music)|motif]] for the chorus.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\">Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/song/what-is-life-t743156 \"George Harrison 'What Is Life'\"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 22 February 2012).</ref> The track opens with this riff,<ref name=\"Gallucci/UCR\" /> which is then joined by Radle's bass and \"churning\" rhythm guitar from Clapton, before Gordon's drums bring the full band in.<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" /><ref name=\"Leng p 87\" /> During the verses, Gordon moves to a square, Motown-style beat \u2013 or \"rock-steady [[Northern soul]] [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]]\" in Leng's words<ref name=\"Leng p 88\" /> \u2013 before returning to the \"galloping rhythm\" of the more open, \"knockout\" choruses,<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\" /> and the song is driven equally by [[Badfinger]] drummer [[Mike Gibbins]]' powerful tambourine work.<ref name=\"Clayson p 296\" />\n\nOn \"What Is Life\", Spector provided what music critic [[David Fricke]] terms \"echo-drenched theater\", in the form of [[reverberation|reverb]]-heavy brass, soaring strings (arranged by [[John Barham]]) and \"a choir of multitracked Harrisons\".<ref name=\"Eds of RS p 201\">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 201.</ref> The vocals and Barham's contribution, along with a brief [[Slide guitar|slide-guitar]] commentary from Harrison over the final verse,<ref

When Adam was about to marry them (Abel with Iqlimiya and Qabil with Layudha, red.) Qabil protested and disobeyed because Habil's sister is ugly and his own sister is beautiful. So he wants his twin sister for himself because he feels he is more entitled to his twin sister. Based on the revelations from Allah, Adam ordered both to sacrifice, who received the [[kurbanya]] then he was entitled to virtue (marrying the twin sister of Qabil).\n\nWhile according to a [[Shia]] Islamic version, from reports of the Shia [[Imamah (Shia)|Imams]], it has been the tradition from the Prophets Adam to Muhammad that it is a sin for a brother to marry a sister and the protest and jealousy of Qabil was due to the acceptance of Habil's sacrifice and Habil being chosen as Adam's successor on Earth and Allah sent down [[houri]] from heaven to marry the sons of Adam. As such, according to a report from the 6th Shia [[Imam Jafar al-Sadiq]], he narrated, \u201cTwo thousand years before the creation of Adam, Allah ordered the Pen (al-Qalam) to inscribe on The Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) all that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment. It included all the divine books. And in the books, Allah has made unlawful the sisters for their brothers. And at present all the four books. We see in Torah, Injeel, Zabur and Qur\u2019an that were revealed by Allah to His Prophets through The Preserved Tablet that nowhere has Allah made the sister lawful for her brother.\" The Imam continued to narrate that, \"When Qabil killed Habil, Adam was very shocked that he cried for five hundred years and did not touch his wife. When he overcame his sorrow he cohabited and Allah gave him a son, Shith ([[Seth]]) who was born a single child. Shith was named Hibtullah (Gift of Allah). He was the first successor to whom a will was made. After Shith, Yafith was also born singly. When both grew up and Allah wanted to multiply human beings and as the Qalam had made the sisters unlawful for their brothers, Allah on a Thursday after Asr (afternoon time) sent a houri, Nazala and ordered Adam to marry Shith to her. Next day another houri, Mauzela was sent and Allah ordered that Yafith be married to her. Adam did as was told. Shith got a son and Yafith a daughter. When both attained maturity Allah ordered Adam to marry them and Adam obeyed. Thus, the lineage of Prophets and Messengers of Allah began.\" In another narration, when asked for Qabil's reason of killing Habil, the 6th Imam replied, \"Because Adam had appointed Habil as his successor. Allah revealed to Adam to hand over the successorship and the Grand Name to Habil while Qabil was the elder. When he knew this, he was angered and said that he was the rightful heir to the successorship and bounties. Under divine instructions, Adam asked both of them to present a sacrifice to Allah. Allah accepted Habil\u2019s sacrifice and rejected Qabil\u2019s so he envied Habil and killed him.\"\n[[File:Cain and abel islamic manuscript.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Cain burying Abel from an [[illuminated manuscript]] version of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'']]\n==In the Qur\u2019an==\n{{Main|Al-Ma'ida}}\nOf Adam's first children, Cain was the elder son and Abel the younger. Each of them presented a sacrifice to God but it was accepted only from Abel, because of the latter's righteous attitude and his faith and firm belief in God. After the offering of their sacrifices, Cain, the wicked sibling, taunted Abel out of envy and told him that he would surely slay him. Abel justly warned Cain that God only accepted the sacrifice of those that are righteous in their doings. He further went on to tell Cain that if Cain did indeed try to slay him,<ref>{{Cite quran|5|28|s=ns}}: \"'If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee': for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds.'\"</ref> Abel would not retaliate and slay him because the God-fearing would never murder for the sake of envy. Abel then told Cain that in murdering him, he would carry the weight not only of his sin but also of the sins of his victim.<ref>{{Cite quran|5|29|s=ns}}: \"'For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.'\"</ref> The victim, as a result, in suffering the injustice, would be forgiven his own sins and the murderer, while being warned, would consequently increase his own sin. Abel preached powerfully and reminded Cain that the punishment for murder would be that he would spend the afterlife in the fires of [[Jahannam|Hell]].\n\nThe innocent pleading and preaching of Abel had no effect upon Cain, for he was full of arrogance, pride and jealousy. He subsequently slew<ref>{{Cite quran|5|30|s=ns}}: \"The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones.\"</ref> the righteous Abel, but in doing so, he ruined himself and became of those who remain lost. This would be the earliest example of the murder of a righteous man taking place upon the earth. In the future, many other evildoers would slay the wise and pious believers.\n\nAfter the murder, Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show Cain how to hide the disgrace of his brother. Cain, in his shame, began to curse himself<ref>{{Cite quran|5|31|s=ns}}: \"Then Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. 'O Woe to me!' said he. 'Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother?' Then he became full of regrets.\"</ref> and he became full of guilt. The thought of the crime at last came to the murderer, as he realized indeed how dreadful it was to slay anyone, the more so as the victim was an innocent and righteous man. Full of regrets, Cain was marked with deep sorrow. The Qur'an states, \"And he became of the regretful.\" 5:31 (Chapter 5, verse 31)\n\n==Message==\n{{See also|Islam and violence}}\n\nThe Qur\u2019an states that the story of Cain and Abel was a message<ref>{{Cite quran|5|32|s=ns}}: \"On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people.

But the Qur\u2019an states that still people rejected the message of the story, and continued to commit grave sins, such as slaying prophets and other righteous people. All the prophets who preached since the time of Adam were persecuted, insulted or reviled in one way or another. With some righteous men, however, the Qur\u2019an states that people went one step further, in attempting to slay them or indeed slaying them. As for the slaying of the righteous, it says \"As to those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty\".<ref>{{Cite quran|3|21|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat|The first martyr of the followers of Muhammad]]\n* [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali]]\n* [[Adam in Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Qur'anic people}}\n{{Muslim saints}}\n{{Cain and Abel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cain And Abel In Islam}}\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adam and Eve]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Cain and Abel]]\n[[Category:Biblical people in Islam]]\n[[Category:Articles about multiple people in the Quran]]\n", "text_old": "{{Islam}}\n{{Religious text primary|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Cain and abel islamic manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Cain burying Abel from an [[illuminated manuscript]] version of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'']]\n'''Q\u0101b\u012bl''' and '''H\u0101b\u012bl''' ({{lang-ar|\u0642\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, [[Cain and Abel]]) are believed by [[Muslims]] to have been the first two sons of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0622\u062f\u0645|links=no}}) and [[Eve#Islamic view|Hawwa\u2019]] ({{lang-ar|\u062d\u0640\u0648\u0627\u0621|links=no}}, Eve) mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur\u2019an]]. \n\nThe events of the story in the Qur\u2019an<ref>{{Cite quran|5|27|s=ns}}: \"Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam.

As for the slaying of the righteous, it says \"As to those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty\".<ref>{{Cite quran|3|21|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat|The first martyr of the followers of Muhammad]]\n* [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali]]\n* [[Adam in Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Qur'anic people}}\n{{Muslim saints}}\n{{Cain and Abel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cain And Abel In Islam}}\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adam and Eve]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Cain and Abel]]\n[[Category:Biblical people in Islam]]\n[[Category:Articles about multiple people in the Quran]]\n", "name_user": "Lotje", "label": "safe", "comment": "Layout", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel_in_Islam"}

FAT file systems instead used alternating tables, as this allowed recovery of the file system if the media was ejected during a write (which occurs frequently in practice with removable media). The optional [[TexFAT]] component adds support for additional backup tables and maps, but may not be supported.\n\nThe exFAT format allows individual files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4&nbsp;GiB limit in less than an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4&nbsp;GiB. With the increase of capacity and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10&nbsp;MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the FAT.

For each file, exFAT uses two separate 64-bit length fields in the directory: the Valid Data Length (VDL) which indicates the real size of the file, and the physical data length.\n\nTo provide improvement in the allocation of cluster storage for a new file, Microsoft incorporated a method to pre-allocate contiguous clusters and bypass the use of updating the FAT table and on December 10, 2013 the US patent office granted patent US8606830.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|8606830}}, ''\"Contiguous File Allocation in an Extensible File System\"''</ref> One feature of exFAT (used in the exFAT implementation within embedded systems) provides atomic transactions for the multiple steps of updating the file system metadata. The feature, called ''Transaction Safe FAT'', or [[TexFAT]], was granted a patent by the US patent office under US7613738 on November 3, 2009.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|7613738}}, ''\"FAT Directory Structure for use in Transaction Safe File System\"''</ref>\n\n=== Directory file set ===\nexFAT and the rest of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses [[B-trees]] for file searching. When a file is accessed, the directory must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.\n\n=== Metadata and checksums ===\nexFAT introduces metadata integrity through the use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a 12 sector region that contains the boot records, BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (Flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining if the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a boot sector virus, but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file and this is called a file set. This file set has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire file set and a mismatch would occur if the directory file set was accidentally or maliciously changed. When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, and to make sure that none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and Allocation Bitmap are required and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.\n\nThe file system provides extensibility through template-based metadata definitions using generic layouts and generic patterns.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|2009164440|Patent Application}}, ''\"Quick Filename Lookup Using Name Hash\"''; Microsoft Corp; contains exFAT specification revision 1.00.

The offsets for the FAT and the cluster heap is adjustable at format-time, so that writes to these areas will happen in as few flash blocks as possible.\n* An \"OEM Parameters\" field can be used to record features such as block size of the underlying storage.<ref name=CE-flash>{{cite web |title=OEM Parameter Definition with exFAT (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee490605(v=winembedded.60) |website=Microsoft documentation |language=en-us}}</ref>\n* The lack of a [[Journaling file system|journal]], so that less data are written\n\nHowever, Microsoft's own implementation on Windows is not truly optimized for flash drives. The OEM parameters are ignored by Windows CE,<ref name=CE-flash/> and it is unknown whether the desktop version performs [[TRIM]] at all.\n\n== Other implementations ==\n{{update-section|date=September 2019}}\nexFAT is a proprietary file system and Microsoft only released the specification for it in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Larabel |first1=Michael |title=Microsoft Publishes exFAT Specification, Encourages Linux Support |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Microsoft-exFAT-Specification |website=Phoronix |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref> This lack of documentation hampered the development of [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] drivers for exFAT. Accordingly, exFAT support was effectively limited to Microsoft's own products and those of Microsoft's licensees, which in turn inhibited exFAT's adoption as a universal exchange format. \n\n[[Interoperability]] requires that certain results be achieved in a particular, predefined way (an [[algorithm]]).

However, since the true theoretical maximum volume size under the current specification cannot exceed 128&nbsp;PiB, a file can never reach that file length. Another reason for the limit is that current IDE/ATA disk addressing is LBA-48, and uses a 48 bit block address to address a sector. A 512 byte sector size would make the maximum addressable file system 512 \u00d7 2{{sup|48}} = 2{{sup|57}}, which is 128&nbsp;PiB.

Most of the vendors signing on for licences are manufacturers of embedded systems or device manufacturers that produce media formatted with exFAT. The entire [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) family, exFAT included, is used for embedded systems because it is lightweight and is better suited for solutions that have low memory and low power requirements, and can be easily implemented in [[firmware]].\n\n== Features ==\n{{list to prose|section|date=October 2019}}\nThe specifications, features, and requirements of the exFAT file system include:\n\n* [[Large file support|File size limit]] of {{nowrap|16 [[exbibyte|exbibytes]]}} ({{nowrap|2<sup>64</sup>\u22121 bytes}}, or about {{nowrap|10<sup>19</sup> bytes}}, which is otherwise limited by a maximum volume size of {{nowrap|128 [[pebibyte|PiB]]<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Size_File\" />}}, or {{nowrap|2<sup>57</sup>\u22121 bytes}}), raised from {{nowrap|4 [[gibibyte|GiB]]}} ({{nowrap|2<sup>32</sup>\u22121 bytes}}) in a standard FAT32 file system.<ref name=\"xpkb\" /> Therefore, for the typical user, seamless interoperability between Windows and {{nowrap|macOS}} platforms for files in excess of 4&nbsp;GiB.\n* Scalability to large disk sizes: ca. 128&nbsp;[[Pebibyte|PiB]] ({{nowrap|2<sup>57</sup>\u22121 bytes}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee681827(v=vs.85).aspx|title=File System Functionality Comparison|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}.</ref><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Size_Volume\" /> maximum, 512&nbsp;[[Tebibyte|TiB]] ({{nowrap|2<sup>49</sup>\u22121 bytes}}) recommended maximum, raised from the 32-bit limit (2&nbsp;TiB for a sector size of 512 bytes) of standard FAT32 partitions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314463 | title=Limitations of the FAT32 File System in Windows XP | accessdate=February 11, 2011 | date=December 1, 2007 | publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>\n* Support for up to 2,796,202 files per [[Folder (computing)|directory]].<ref name=\"uspatent\" /><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Count_Files\" /> Microsoft documents a limit of 65,534 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22122) files per sub-directory for their FAT32 implementation, but other operating systems have no special limit for the number of files in a FAT32 directory.

FAT file systems instead used alternating tables, as this allowed recovery of the file system if the media was ejected during a write (which occurs frequently in practice with removable media). The optional [[TexFAT]] component adds support for additional backup tables and maps, but may not be supported.\n\nThe exFAT format allows individual files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4&nbsp;GiB limit in less than an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4&nbsp;GiB. With the increase of capacity and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10&nbsp;MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the FAT. A single bit in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous, telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT. This optimization is analogous to an [[Extent (file systems)|extent]] in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.\n\n== Adoption ==\nexFAT is supported in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] with update KB955704,<ref name=\"xpkb\" /> [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]], [[Windows Vista#Service Pack 1|Windows Vista with Service Pack 1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx#_Toc175944550|title=Vista SP1 Whitepaper|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=August 28, 2007|first=Brandon|last=LeBlanc|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> [[Windows Server 2008]],<ref name=\"Server2008exFATsupport\" /> [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows Server 2008 R2|Windows Server 2008 R2 (except Windows Server 2008 Server Core)]], [[Windows 10]], [[Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X]] starting from 10.6.5 and [[iPadOS]].<ref name=\"Mac OS X 10.6.5 Notes\" /><ref name=\"fsck_exfat man\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/07/how-to-use-external-storage-on-ipad-and-iphone-with-ios-13|title=How to use external storage on iPad and iPhone with iOS 13|last=Friday|first=rew O'Hara|last2=June 07|website=AppleInsider|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26|last3=2019|last4=PT|first4=12:11 pm}}</ref>\n\nCompanies can integrate exFAT into a specific group of consumer devices, including cameras, camcorders, and digital photo frames for a [[flat fee]].

For each file, exFAT uses two separate 64-bit length fields in the directory: the Valid Data Length (VDL) which indicates the real size of the file, and the physical data length.\n\nTo provide improvement in the allocation of cluster storage for a new file, Microsoft incorporated a method to pre-allocate contiguous clusters and bypass the use of updating the FAT table and on December 10, 2013 the US patent office granted patent US8606830.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|8606830}}, ''\"Contiguous File Allocation in an Extensible File System\"''</ref> One feature of exFAT (used in the exFAT implementation within embedded systems) provides atomic transactions for the multiple steps of updating the file system metadata. The feature, called ''Transaction Safe FAT'', or [[TexFAT]], was granted a patent by the US patent office under US7613738 on November 3, 2009.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|7613738}}, ''\"FAT Directory Structure for use in Transaction Safe File System\"''</ref>\n\n=== Directory file set ===\nexFAT and the rest of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses [[B-trees]] for file searching. When a file is accessed, the directory must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.\n\n=== Metadata and checksums ===\nexFAT introduces metadata integrity through the use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a 12 sector region that contains the boot records, BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (Flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining if the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a boot sector virus, but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file and this is called a file set. This file set has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire file set and a mismatch would occur if the directory file set was accidentally or maliciously changed. When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, and to make sure that none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and Allocation Bitmap are required and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.\n\nThe file system provides extensibility through template-based metadata definitions using generic layouts and generic patterns.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|2009164440|Patent Application}}, ''\"Quick Filename Lookup Using Name Hash\"''; Microsoft Corp; contains exFAT specification revision 1.00.

However, since the true theoretical maximum volume size under the current specification cannot exceed 128&nbsp;PiB, a file can never reach that file length.

By assuming that title, the sovereign of [[Moscow]] tried to emphasize that he was a major ruler or [[emperor]] (''tsar'' ({{lang-ru | \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c}}) represents the Slavic adaptation of the Roman Imperial title/name [[Caesar (title) | ''Caesar'']]<ref>\n {{OEtymD| tsar | accessdate= 2019-06-13}}\n</ref>) on a par with the [[List of Byzantine emperors| Byzantine emperor]] or with the Mongol [[Khan (title) |khan]]. Indeed, after [[Ivan III of Russia |Ivan III]] married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the late Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], in 1472, the Moscow court adopted [[Byzantine Empire| Byzantine]] terms, rituals, titles, and emblems such as the [[double-headed eagle]], which survives in the [[Coat of Arms of Russia]].\n\nAt first, the Byzantine term ''[[autokrator]]'' expressed only the literal meaning of an independent ruler, but in the reign of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (1533-1584) it came to imply unlimited ([[autocratic]]) rule. In 1547 the Grand Duke Ivan IV was crowned Tsar and thus was recognized - at least by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] - as Emperor. Notably, the hegumen [[Philotheus of Pskov]] claimed in 1510 that after [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the Russian Tsar remained the only legitimate Orthodox ruler, and that [[Moscow, third Rome|Moscow was the Third Rome]], becoming the final lineal successor to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and[[Byzantine Empire| Constantinople]], the two centers of [[Christianity]] and of the Roman Empires ([[Western Roman Empire |Western]] and[[Eastern Roman Empire | Eastern]]) of earlier periods. The [[Third Rome concept|\"Third Rome\" concept]] would resonate in the self-image of the Russian people in future centuries.\n\n==Early reign of Ivan IV==\nThe development of the Tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign of Ivan IV, and he gained the sobriquet \"Grozny\". The English word ''terrible'' is usually used to translate the Russian word ''grozny'' in Ivan's nickname, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word ''grozny'' reflects the older English usage of ''terrible'' as in \"inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable\". It does not convey the more modern connotations of English ''terrible'', such as \"defective\" or \"evil\". [[Vladimir Dal]] defined ''grozny'' specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: \"Courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience\".<ref>Dal, Vladimir, [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]], article ''\u0413\u0420\u041e\u0417\u0418\u0422\u042c''.

The [[Shuysky]] and [[Belsky family (Gediminid)|Belsky]] factions of the [[boyar]]s competed for control of the regency until Ivan assumed the throne in 1547. Reflecting Moscow's new imperial claims, Ivan's coronation as Tsar was a ritual modeled after those of the Byzantine emperors. With the continuing assistance of a group of boyars, Ivan began his reign with a series of useful reforms. In the 1550s, he declared a new law code, revamped the military, and reorganized local government. These reforms undoubtedly were intended to strengthen the state in the face of continuous warfare. The key documents prepared by the so-called [[Izbrannaya Rada|Select Council]] of advisors and promulgated during this period are as follows:\n\n{{Muscovite Constitution}}\n\n==Foreign policies of Ivan IV==\n{{Main|Muscovite\u2013Lithuanian Wars|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Clocher d'Ivan le Grand.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], raised to the present height during the reign of [[Boris Godunov]]]]\n\n[[Muscovy (Grand Duchy)]] remained a fairly unknown society in Western Europe until Baron [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] published his [[Notes on Muscovite Affairs|Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]] (literally ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs'') in 1549. This provided a broad view of what had been a rarely visited and poorly reported state. In the 1630s, the Russian Tsardom was visited by [[Adam Olearius]], whose lively and well-informed writings were soon translated into all the major languages of [[Europe]].\n\nFurther information about Russia was circulated by English and Dutch [[merchant]]s. One of them, [[Richard Chancellor]], sailed to the [[White Sea]] in 1553 and continued overland to Moscow. Upon his return to England, the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by himself, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]], and several London merchants. Ivan IV used these merchants to exchange letters with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nDespite the domestic turmoil of the 1530s and 1540s, Russia continued to wage wars and to expand. It grew from 2.8 to 5.4 million square kilometers from 1533 to 1584.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, p. 80</ref> Ivan [[Russo-Kazan Wars|defeated and annexed]] the [[Khanate of Kazan]] on the middle [[Volga River|Volga]] in 1552 and later the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], where the Volga meets the [[Caspian Sea]]. These victories transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state, which it continues to be today. The tsar now controlled the entire Volga River and gained access to Central Asia.\n\nExpanding to the northwest toward the [[Baltic Sea]] proved to be much more difficult. In 1558, Ivan invaded [[Livonia]], eventually involving himself in a [[Livonian War|twenty-five-year war]] against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]. Despite occasional successes, Ivan's army was pushed back, and the nation failed to secure a coveted position on the Baltic Sea.\n\nHoping to make profit from Russia's concentration on Livonian affairs, [[Devlet I Giray]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], accompanied by as many as 120,000 horsemen, [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|repeatedly devastated the Moscow region]], until the [[Battle of Molodi]] put a stop to such northward incursions. But for decades to come, the southern borderland was annually pillaged by the [[Nogai Horde]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]], who took local inhabitants with them as slaves. Tens of thousands of soldiers protected the [[Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Belt]] \u2014 a burden for a state whose social and economic development was stagnating.\n\n==Oprichnina==\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n[[File:Apostol 1564 Frontispis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Apostle'' (1564) by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], one of the first Russian printed books]]\n\nDuring the late 1550s, Ivan developed a hostility toward his advisers, the government, and the [[boyar]]s. Historians have not determined whether policy differences, personal animosities, or mental imbalance caused his wrath. In 1565, he divided Russia into two parts: his private domain (or [[oprichnina]]) and the public realm (or [[zemshchina]]). For his private domain, Ivan chose some of the most prosperous and important districts of Russia. In these areas, Ivan's agents attacked boyars, merchants, and even common people, summarily executing some and confiscating land and possessions. Thus began a decade of terror in Russia that culminated in the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] (1570).\n\nAs a result of the policies of the ''oprichnina'', Ivan broke the economic and political power of the leading [[boyar]] families, thereby destroying precisely those persons who had built up Russia and were the most capable of administering it. Trade diminished, and peasants, faced with mounting taxes and threats of violence, began to leave Russia. [[George's Day in Autumn|Efforts to curtail the mobility of the peasants]] by tying them to their land brought Russia closer to legal [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]]. In 1572, Ivan finally abandoned the practices of the oprichnina.\n\nAccording to a popular theory,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{by whom|date=October 2015}} the oprichnina was started by Ivan in order to mobilize resources for the wars and to quell opposition. Regardless of the reason, Ivan's domestic and foreign policies had a devastating effect on Russia and led to a period of social struggle and civil war, the [[Time of Troubles]] (''Smutnoye vremya'', 1598-1613).\n\n==Time of Troubles==\n{{Main|Time of Troubles|Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)}}\nIvan IV was succeeded by his son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]], who was mentally deficient. Actual power went to Feodor's brother-in-law, the boyar [[Boris Godunov]] (who is credited with abolishing [[George's Day in Autumn|Yuri's Day]], the only time of the year when serfs were free to move from one landowner to another). Perhaps the most important event of Feodor's reign was the proclamation of the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1589. The creation of the patriarchate climaxed the evolution of a separate and totally independent [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn 1598, Feodor died without an heir, ending the [[Rurik]] Dynasty. Boris Godunov then convened a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'', a national assembly of boyars, church officials, and commoners, which proclaimed him tsar, although various boyar factions refused to recognize the decision. Widespread crop failures caused the [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]], and during the ensuing discontent, a man emerged who claimed to be [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Demetrius]], Ivan IV's son who had died in 1591. This pretender to the throne, who came to be known as [[False Dmitriy I]], gained support in Poland and marched to Moscow, gathering followers among the boyars and other elements as he went. Historians speculate<ref>[[Ruslan Skrynnikov]]. ''Boris Godunov''. Moscow: Nauka, 1983. Reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|5-17-010892-3}}.</ref> that Godunov would have weathered this crisis had he not died in 1605. As a result, False Dmitriy I entered Moscow and was crowned tsar that year, following the murder of Tsar [[Feodor II of Russia|Feodor II]], Godunov's son.\n\nSubsequently, Russia entered a period of continuous chaos, known as ''The [[Time of Troubles]]'' (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f). Despite the Tsar's persecution of the boyars, the townspeople's dissatisfaction, and the gradual enserfment of the peasantry, efforts at restricting the power of the Tsar were only halfhearted. Finding no institutional alternative to the autocracy, discontented Russians rallied behind various pretenders to the throne. During that period, the goal of political activity was to gain influence over the sitting autocrat or to place one's own candidate on the throne. The boyars fought among themselves, the lower classes revolted blindly, and foreign armies occupied [[the Kremlin]] in Moscow, prompting many to accept [[Tsarist autocracy]] as a necessary means to restoring order and unity in Russia.\n\n[[File:Lissner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Poles]] surrender the [[Moscow Kremlin]] to [[Prince Pozharsky]] in 1612. Painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]\nThe Time of Troubles included a civil war in which a struggle over the throne was complicated by the machinations of rival boyar factions, the intervention of regional powers Poland and Sweden, and intense popular discontent, led by [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]. False Dmitriy I and his Polish garrison were overthrown, and a boyar, [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]], was proclaimed tsar in 1606. In his attempt to retain the throne, Shuysky allied himself with the Swedes, unleashing the [[Ingrian War]] with Sweden. [[False Dmitry II]], allied with the Poles, appeared under the walls of Moscow and set up a mock court in the village of [[Tushino]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Poland intervened into Russian affairs officially]], captured Shuisky, and occupied the Kremlin. A group of Russian boyars signed in 1610 a treaty of peace, recognising [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|Ladislaus IV of Poland]], son of Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], as tsar. In 1611, [[False Dmitry III]] appeared in the Swedish-occupied territories, but was soon apprehended and executed. The Polish presence led to a patriotic revival among the Russians, and a volunteer army, financed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchants and blessed by the Orthodox Church, was formed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and, led by Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]], drove the Poles out of the Kremlin. In 1613, a [[zemsky Sobor]] proclaimed the boyar [[Michael of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]] as tsar, beginning the 300-year reign of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family.\n\n==Romanovs==\n[[File:Tsar boyar duma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Andrei Ryabushkin]]: ''Tsar Michael at the Session of the [[Boyar Duma]]'' (1893)]]\nThe immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore order. However, Russia's major enemies, Poland and Sweden, were engaged in a conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617. The [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)]] was ended with the [[Truce of Deulino]] in 1618, restoring temporarily Polish and Lithuanian rule over some territories, including [[Smolensk]], lost by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1509.\n\nThe early [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were weak rulers. Under Mikhail, state affairs were in the hands of the tsar's father, [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Filaret]], who in 1619 became Patriarch of Moscow. Later, Mikhail's son [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey]] (r. 1645-1676) relied on a boyar, [[Boris Morozov]], to run his government. Morozov abused his position by exploiting the populace, and in 1648 Aleksey dismissed him in the wake of the [[Salt Riot]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter [[Smolensk War|an unsuccessful attempt to regain Smolensk]] from Poland in 1632, Russia made peace with Poland in 1634. Polish king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], whose father and predecessor was [[Sigismund III Vasa]], had been elected by Russian boyars as tsar of Russia during the Time of Troubles, renounced all claims to the title as a condition of the peace treaty.\n\n==Legal code of 1649==\nThe [[autocracy]] survived the [[Time of Troubles]] and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central [[bureaucracy]]. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the ruler's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] or the [[boyar]] faction controlling the throne. In the 17th century, the bureaucracy expanded dramatically. The number of government departments (''prikazy'' ; sing., ''[[prikaz]]'' ) increased from twenty-two in 1613 to eighty by mid-century. Although the departments often had overlapping and conflicting [[jurisdiction]]s, the central government, through [[province|provincial]] governors, was able to control and regulate all social groups, as well as trade, manufacturing, and even the [[Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Godfrey Kneller - Portrait of P.Potemkin (1682, Hermitage) - contrast.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Russian diplomat and [[voivode]] [[Pyotr Potemkin]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nThe [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye]], a comprehensive [[legal code]] introduced in 1649, illustrates the extent of state control over [[Russia]]n society. By that time, the boyars had largely merged with the new elite, who were obligatory servitors of the state, to form a new [[nobility]], the [[dvoryanstvo]]. The state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military because of permanent warfare on southern and western borders and attacks of [[nomad]]s. In return, the nobility received land and [[peasant]]s. In the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one [[landlord]] to another; the 1649 code officially attached peasants to their [[home]].\n\nThe state fully sanctioned [[serfdom]], and runaway peasants became state [[fugitive]]s. Landlords had complete power over their peasants<!--and bought, sold, traded, and [[mortgage]]d them-->. Peasants living on state-owned land, however, were not considered serfs. They were organized into [[commune]]s, which were responsible for taxes and other obligations. Like serfs, however, state peasants were attached to the land they farmed. Middle-class urban [[tradesmen]] and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes. By chaining much of Russian society to specific domiciles, the legal code of 1649 curtailed movement and subordinated the people to the interests of the state.\n\nUnder this code, increased state taxes and regulations altered the social discontent that had been simmering since the Time of Troubles. In the 1650s and 1660s, the number of peasant escapes increased dramatically. A favourite refuge was the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] region, domain of the [[Don Cossacks]]. A major uprising occurred in the [[Volga]] region in 1670 and 1671. [[Stenka Razin]], a Cossack who was from the Don River region, led a revolt that drew together wealthy Cossacks who were well established in the region and escaped serfs seeking free land. The unexpected uprising swept up the Volga River valley and even threatened Moscow. Tsarist troops finally defeated the rebels after they had occupied major cities along the Volga in an operation whose panache captured the imaginations of later generations of Russians. Razin was publicly tortured and executed.\n\n==Acquisition of Ukrainian lands==\n[[File:Russian clothes Soln.jpeg|thumb|A warrior of the Russian noble cavalry (''\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430'') during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War of 1654\u20131667]]. The drawing is based on the pieces preserved in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].]]\n\nThe Tsardom of Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century. In the southwest, it claimed eastern [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] lands, which had been under [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] rule and sought assistance from the Tsardom to leave the rule of the Commonwealth. The [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], warriors organized in military formations, lived in the frontier areas bordering Poland, the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] lands. Although part of them was serving in the Polish army as [[Registered Cossacks]], the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] remained fiercely independent and staged several rebellions against the Poles. In 1648, the peasants of what is now Ukraine joined the Cossacks in rebellion during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. Initially, Cossacks were allied with [[Crimean Tatars]], which had helped them to throw off Polish rule. Once the Poles convinced the Tartars to switch sides, the Zaporozhian Cossacks needed military help to maintain their position.\n\nIn 1648, the  [[Hetman]] (leader) of the [[Zaporozhian host|Zaporozhian Host]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to ally with the Russian [[tsar]], [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer, which was ratified in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654, led to [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|a protracted war between Poland and Russia]]. The [[Truce of Andrusovo]], which did not involve the Hetmanate ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]) as a participating party of the agreement ended the war in 1667. Cossacks considered it as a Moscow betrayal. As a result, it split Ukrainian territory along the [[Dnieper River]], reuniting the western sector (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) with Poland and leaving the eastern sector ([[Left-bank Ukraine]]) self-governing under the sovereignty of the tsar. However, the self-government did not last long and Eastern Ukrainian territory was eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire (after the [[Battle of Poltava]]) during the 18th century.\n\n==Raskol (Schism)==\n{{Main|Raskol}}\n[[File:PhilipandNikon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Patriarch Nikon]] and Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] in the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]]]]\n\nRussia's southwestern expansion, particularly its incorporation of eastern Ukraine, had [[unintended consequence]]s. Most Ukrainians were Orthodox, but their close contact with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Polish also brought them Western intellectual currents. Through the Ukrainian [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Academy in Kiev]], Russia gained links to Polish and Central European influences and to the wider Orthodox world. Although the Ukrainian link induced creativity in many areas, it also weakened traditional Russian religious practices and culture. The Russian Orthodox Church discovered that its isolation from [[Constantinople]] had caused variations to appear between their [[liturgical book]]s and practices.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox patriarch, [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], was determined to bring the Russian texts back into conformity with the [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and practices of the time. But Nikon encountered opposition among the many Russians who viewed the corrections as improper foreign intrusions. When the Orthodox Church forced Nikon's reforms, a schism resulted in 1667. Those who did not accept the reforms came to be called the [[Old Believers]]; they were officially pronounced heretics and were persecuted by the church and the state. The chief opposition figure, the protopope [[Avvakum]], was burned at the stake. The split afterwards became permanent, and many merchants and peasants joined the Old Believers.\n\nThe tsar's court also felt the impact of Ukraine and the West. Kiev was a major transmitter of new ideas and insight through the famed scholarly [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|academy]] that [[Peter Mogila|Metropolitan Mohyla]] founded there in 1631. Other more direct channels to the West opened as international trade increased and more foreigners came to Russia. The Tsar's court was interested in the West's more advanced technology, particularly when military applications were involved. By the end of the 17th century, Ukrainian, Polish, and West European penetration had weakened the Russian cultural synthesis\u2014at least among the elite\u2014and had prepared the way for an even more radical transformation.\n\n==Conquest of Siberia==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n[[File:Surikov Pokoreniye Sibiri Yermakom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Vasily Surikov]]: ''Yermak's Conquest of Siberia'' (1895)]]\nRussia's eastward expansion encountered little resistance. In 1581, the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchant family, interested in the fur trade, hired a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] leader, [[Yermak Timofeyevich]], to lead an expedition into western [[Siberia]]. Yermak defeated the [[Khanate of Sibir]] and claimed the territories west of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh]] Rivers for Russia.\n\nFrom such bases as [[Mangazeya]], merchants, traders, and explorers pushed eastward from the [[Ob River]] to the [[Yenisei River]], then on to the [[Lena River]] and the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Cossack [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the passage between America and Asia. By the middle of the 17th century, Russians had reached the [[Amur River]] and the outskirts of the [[Late Imperial China|Chinese Empire]].\n\nAfter a period of conflict with the [[Qing dynasty]], Russia made peace with [[China]] in 1689. By the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], Russia ceded its claims to the Amur Valley, but it gained access to the region east of [[Lake Baikal]] and the trade route to [[Beijing]]. Peace with China strengthened the initial breakthrough to the Pacific that had been made in the middle of the century.\n\n==Reign of Peter the Great and establishment of the Russian Empire==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Main|Peter the Great|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity Church at Putinki]], an example of the 17th-century Russian [[uzorochye]] style]]\n\n[[Peter the Great]] (1672\u20131725), who became ruler in his own right in 1696, was destined to bring the Tsardom of Russia, which had little contact with Europe and was mostly seen as a regional power, into the mainstream of European culture and politics. After suppressing numerous rebellions with considerable bloodshed, Peter embarked on [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|a tour of Western Europe incognito]]. He became impressed with what he saw and was awakened to the backwardness of Russia. Peter began requiring the nobility to wear Western clothing and shave off their beards, an action that the [[boyar]]s protested bitterly. Arranged marriages among nobility were banned and the Orthodox Church brought under state control. Military academies were established to create a modern European-style army and officer corps in place of the disorganized levies that Muscovite rulers had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes did not win Peter many friends and in fact caused great political division in the country. These along with his notorious cruelties (such as the torture death of [[Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|his own son]] for plotting a rebellion) and the immense human suffering that accompanied many of his projects such as the construction of [[Saint Petersburg]] led many pious Russians to believe that he was the [[Antichrist]]. The [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]] consumed much of Peter's attention for years, however the Swedes were eventually defeated and peace agreed to in 1721. Russia annexed the Baltic coast from Sweden and parts of [[Finland]], which would become the site of the new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. The Russian victory in the Great Northern War marked a watershed in European politics, as it not only brought about the eclipse of Sweden and Poland as great powers, but also Russia's decisive emergence as a permanent factor in Europe. Expansion into Siberia also continued and [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u201323)|war]] with [[Persia]] brought about the acquisition of territory in the [[Caucasus]], although Russia surrendered those gains after Peter's death in 1725.\n\n==State flags==\nThere was no single flag during the Tsardom.

By assuming that title, the sovereign of [[Moscow]] tried to emphasize that he was a major ruler or [[emperor]] (''tsar'' ({{lang-ru | \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c}}) represents the Slavic adaptation of the Roman Imperial title/name [[Caesar (title) | ''Caesar'']]<ref>\n {{OEtymD| tsar | accessdate= 2019-06-13}}\n</ref>) on a par with the [[List of Byzantine emperors| Byzantine emperor]] or with the Mongol [[Khan (title) |khan]]. Indeed, after [[Ivan III of Russia |Ivan III]] married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the late Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], in 1472, the Moscow court adopted [[Byzantine Empire| Byzantine]] terms, rituals, titles, and emblems such as the [[double-headed eagle]], which survives in the [[Coat of Arms of Russia]].\n\nAt first, the Byzantine term ''[[autokrator]]'' expressed only the literal meaning of an independent ruler, but in the reign of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (1533-1584) it came to imply unlimited ([[autocratic]]) rule. In 1547 the Grand Duke Ivan IV was crowned Tsar and thus was recognized - at least by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] - as Emperor. Notably, the hegumen [[Philotheus of Pskov]] claimed in 1510 that after [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the Russian Tsar remained the only legitimate Orthodox ruler, and that [[Moscow, third Rome|Moscow was the Third Rome]], becoming the final lineal successor to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire| Constantinople]], the two centers of [[Christianity]] and of the Roman Empires ([[Western Roman Empire |Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire | Eastern]]) of earlier periods. The [[Third Rome concept|\"Third Rome\" concept]] would resonate in the self-image of the Russian people in future centuries.\n\n==Early reign of Ivan IV==\nThe development of the Tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign of Ivan IV, and he gained the sobriquet \"Grozny\". The English word ''terrible'' is usually used to translate the Russian word ''grozny'' in Ivan's nickname, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word ''grozny'' reflects the older English usage of ''terrible'' as in \"inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable\". It does not convey the more modern connotations of English ''terrible'', such as \"defective\" or \"evil\". [[Vladimir Dal]] defined ''grozny'' specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: \"Courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience\".<ref>Dal, Vladimir, [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]], article ''\u0413\u0420\u041e\u0417\u0418\u0422\u042c''.

The [[Shuysky]] and [[Belsky family (Gediminid)|Belsky]] factions of the [[boyar]]s competed for control of the regency until Ivan assumed the throne in 1547. Reflecting Moscow's new imperial claims, Ivan's coronation as Tsar was a ritual modeled after those of the Byzantine emperors. With the continuing assistance of a group of boyars, Ivan began his reign with a series of useful reforms. In the 1550s, he declared a new law code, revamped the military, and reorganized local government. These reforms undoubtedly were intended to strengthen the state in the face of continuous warfare. The key documents prepared by the so-called [[Izbrannaya Rada|Select Council]] of advisors and promulgated during this period are as follows:\n\n{{Muscovite Constitution}}\n\n==Foreign policies of Ivan IV==\n{{Main|Muscovite\u2013Lithuanian Wars|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Clocher d'Ivan le Grand.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], raised to the present height during the reign of [[Boris Godunov]]]]\n\n[[Muscovy (Grand Duchy)]] remained a fairly unknown society in Western Europe until Baron [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] published his [[Notes on Muscovite Affairs|Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]] (literally ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs'') in 1549. This provided a broad view of what had been a rarely visited and poorly reported state. In the 1630s, the Russian Tsardom was visited by [[Adam Olearius]], whose lively and well-informed writings were soon translated into all the major languages of [[Europe]].\n\nFurther information about Russia was circulated by English and Dutch [[merchant]]s. One of them, [[Richard Chancellor]], sailed to the [[White Sea]] in 1553 and continued overland to Moscow. Upon his return to England, the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by himself, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]], and several London merchants. Ivan IV used these merchants to exchange letters with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nDespite the domestic turmoil of the 1530s and 1540s, Russia continued to wage wars and to expand. It grew from 2.8 to 5.4 million square kilometers from 1533 to 1584.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, p. 80</ref> Ivan [[Russo-Kazan Wars|defeated and annexed]] the [[Khanate of Kazan]] on the middle [[Volga River|Volga]] in 1552 and later the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], where the Volga meets the [[Caspian Sea]]. These victories transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state, which it continues to be today. The tsar now controlled the entire Volga River and gained access to Central Asia.\n\nExpanding to the northwest toward the [[Baltic Sea]] proved to be much more difficult. In 1558, Ivan invaded [[Livonia]], eventually involving himself in a [[Livonian War|twenty-five-year war]] against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]. Despite occasional successes, Ivan's army was pushed back, and the nation failed to secure a coveted position on the Baltic Sea.\n\nHoping to make profit from Russia's concentration on Livonian affairs, [[Devlet I Giray]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], accompanied by as many as 120,000 horsemen, [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|repeatedly devastated the Moscow region]], until the [[Battle of Molodi]] put a stop to such northward incursions. But for decades to come, the southern borderland was annually pillaged by the [[Nogai Horde]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]], who took local inhabitants with them as slaves. Tens of thousands of soldiers protected the [[Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Belt]] \u2014 a burden for a state whose social and economic development was stagnating.\n\n==Oprichnina==\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n[[File:Apostol 1564 Frontispis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Apostle'' (1564) by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], one of the first Russian printed books]]\n\nDuring the late 1550s, Ivan developed a hostility toward his advisers, the government, and the [[boyar]]s. Historians have not determined whether policy differences, personal animosities, or mental imbalance caused his wrath. In 1565, he divided Russia into two parts: his private domain (or [[oprichnina]]) and the public realm (or [[zemshchina]]). For his private domain, Ivan chose some of the most prosperous and important districts of Russia. In these areas, Ivan's agents attacked boyars, merchants, and even common people, summarily executing some and confiscating land and possessions. Thus began a decade of terror in Russia that culminated in the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] (1570).\n\nAs a result of the policies of the ''oprichnina'', Ivan broke the economic and political power of the leading [[boyar]] families, thereby destroying precisely those persons who had built up Russia and were the most capable of administering it. Trade diminished, and peasants, faced with mounting taxes and threats of violence, began to leave Russia. [[George's Day in Autumn|Efforts to curtail the mobility of the peasants]] by tying them to their land brought Russia closer to legal [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]]. In 1572, Ivan finally abandoned the practices of the oprichnina.\n\nAccording to a popular theory,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{by whom|date=October 2015}} the oprichnina was started by Ivan in order to mobilize resources for the wars and to quell opposition. Regardless of the reason, Ivan's domestic and foreign policies had a devastating effect on Russia and led to a period of social struggle and civil war, the [[Time of Troubles]] (''Smutnoye vremya'', 1598-1613).\n\n==Time of Troubles==\n{{Main|Time of Troubles|Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)}}\nIvan IV was succeeded by his son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]], who was mentally deficient. Actual power went to Feodor's brother-in-law, the boyar [[Boris Godunov]] (who is credited with abolishing [[George's Day in Autumn|Yuri's Day]], the only time of the year when serfs were free to move from one landowner to another). Perhaps the most important event of Feodor's reign was the proclamation of the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1589. The creation of the patriarchate climaxed the evolution of a separate and totally independent [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn 1598, Feodor died without an heir, ending the [[Rurik]] Dynasty. Boris Godunov then convened a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'', a national assembly of boyars, church officials, and commoners, which proclaimed him tsar, although various boyar factions refused to recognize the decision. Widespread crop failures caused the [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]], and during the ensuing discontent, a man emerged who claimed to be [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Demetrius]], Ivan IV's son who had died in 1591. This pretender to the throne, who came to be known as [[False Dmitriy I]], gained support in Poland and marched to Moscow, gathering followers among the boyars and other elements as he went. Historians speculate<ref>[[Ruslan Skrynnikov]]. ''Boris Godunov''. Moscow: Nauka, 1983. Reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|5-17-010892-3}}.</ref> that Godunov would have weathered this crisis had he not died in 1605. As a result, False Dmitriy I entered Moscow and was crowned tsar that year, following the murder of Tsar [[Feodor II of Russia|Feodor II]], Godunov's son.\n\nSubsequently, Russia entered a period of continuous chaos, known as ''The [[Time of Troubles]]'' (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f). Despite the Tsar's persecution of the boyars, the townspeople's dissatisfaction, and the gradual enserfment of the peasantry, efforts at restricting the power of the Tsar were only halfhearted. Finding no institutional alternative to the autocracy, discontented Russians rallied behind various pretenders to the throne. During that period, the goal of political activity was to gain influence over the sitting autocrat or to place one's own candidate on the throne. The boyars fought among themselves, the lower classes revolted blindly, and foreign armies occupied [[the Kremlin]] in Moscow, prompting many to accept [[Tsarist autocracy]] as a necessary means to restoring order and unity in Russia.\n\n[[File:Lissner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Poles]] surrender the [[Moscow Kremlin]] to [[Prince Pozharsky]] in 1612. Painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]\nThe Time of Troubles included a civil war in which a struggle over the throne was complicated by the machinations of rival boyar factions, the intervention of regional powers Poland and Sweden, and intense popular discontent, led by [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]. False Dmitriy I and his Polish garrison were overthrown, and a boyar, [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]], was proclaimed tsar in 1606. In his attempt to retain the throne, Shuysky allied himself with the Swedes, unleashing the [[Ingrian War]] with Sweden. [[False Dmitry II]], allied with the Poles, appeared under the walls of Moscow and set up a mock court in the village of [[Tushino]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Poland intervened into Russian affairs officially]], captured Shuisky, and occupied the Kremlin. A group of Russian boyars signed in 1610 a treaty of peace, recognising [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|Ladislaus IV of Poland]], son of Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], as tsar. In 1611, [[False Dmitry III]] appeared in the Swedish-occupied territories, but was soon apprehended and executed. The Polish presence led to a patriotic revival among the Russians, and a volunteer army, financed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchants and blessed by the Orthodox Church, was formed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and, led by Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]], drove the Poles out of the Kremlin. In 1613, a [[zemsky Sobor]] proclaimed the boyar [[Michael of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]] as tsar, beginning the 300-year reign of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family.\n\n==Romanovs==\n[[File:Tsar boyar duma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Andrei Ryabushkin]]: ''Tsar Michael at the Session of the [[Boyar Duma]]'' (1893)]]\nThe immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore order. However, Russia's major enemies, Poland and Sweden, were engaged in a conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617. The [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)]] was ended with the [[Truce of Deulino]] in 1618, restoring temporarily Polish and Lithuanian rule over some territories, including [[Smolensk]], lost by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1509.\n\nThe early [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were weak rulers. Under Mikhail, state affairs were in the hands of the tsar's father, [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Filaret]], who in 1619 became Patriarch of Moscow. Later, Mikhail's son [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey]] (r. 1645-1676) relied on a boyar, [[Boris Morozov]], to run his government. Morozov abused his position by exploiting the populace, and in 1648 Aleksey dismissed him in the wake of the [[Salt Riot]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter [[Smolensk War|an unsuccessful attempt to regain Smolensk]] from Poland in 1632, Russia made peace with Poland in 1634. Polish king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], whose father and predecessor was [[Sigismund III Vasa]], had been elected by Russian boyars as tsar of Russia during the Time of Troubles, renounced all claims to the title as a condition of the peace treaty.\n\n==Legal code of 1649==\nThe [[autocracy]] survived the [[Time of Troubles]] and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central [[bureaucracy]]. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the ruler's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] or the [[boyar]] faction controlling the throne. In the 17th century, the bureaucracy expanded dramatically. The number of government departments (''prikazy'' ; sing., ''[[prikaz]]'' ) increased from twenty-two in 1613 to eighty by mid-century. Although the departments often had overlapping and conflicting [[jurisdiction]]s, the central government, through [[province|provincial]] governors, was able to control and regulate all social groups, as well as trade, manufacturing, and even the [[Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Godfrey Kneller - Portrait of P.Potemkin (1682, Hermitage) - contrast.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Russian diplomat and [[voivode]] [[Pyotr Potemkin]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nThe [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye]], a comprehensive [[legal code]] introduced in 1649, illustrates the extent of state control over [[Russia]]n society. By that time, the boyars had largely merged with the new elite, who were obligatory servitors of the state, to form a new [[nobility]], the [[dvoryanstvo]]. The state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military because of permanent warfare on southern and western borders and attacks of [[nomad]]s. In return, the nobility received land and [[peasant]]s. In the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one [[landlord]] to another; the 1649 code officially attached peasants to their [[home]].\n\nThe state fully sanctioned [[serfdom]], and runaway peasants became state [[fugitive]]s. Landlords had complete power over their peasants<!--and bought, sold, traded, and [[mortgage]]d them-->. Peasants living on state-owned land, however, were not considered serfs. They were organized into [[commune]]s, which were responsible for taxes and other obligations. Like serfs, however, state peasants were attached to the land they farmed. Middle-class urban [[tradesmen]] and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes. By chaining much of Russian society to specific domiciles, the legal code of 1649 curtailed movement and subordinated the people to the interests of the state.\n\nUnder this code, increased state taxes and regulations altered the social discontent that had been simmering since the Time of Troubles. In the 1650s and 1660s, the number of peasant escapes increased dramatically. A favourite refuge was the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] region, domain of the [[Don Cossacks]]. A major uprising occurred in the [[Volga]] region in 1670 and 1671. [[Stenka Razin]], a Cossack who was from the Don River region, led a revolt that drew together wealthy Cossacks who were well established in the region and escaped serfs seeking free land. The unexpected uprising swept up the Volga River valley and even threatened Moscow. Tsarist troops finally defeated the rebels after they had occupied major cities along the Volga in an operation whose panache captured the imaginations of later generations of Russians. Razin was publicly tortured and executed.\n\n==Acquisition of Ukrainian lands==\n[[File:Russian clothes Soln.jpeg|thumb|A warrior of the Russian noble cavalry (''\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430'') during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War of 1654\u20131667]]. The drawing is based on the pieces preserved in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].]]\n\nThe Tsardom of Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century. In the southwest, it claimed eastern [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] lands, which had been under [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] rule and sought assistance from the Tsardom to leave the rule of the Commonwealth. The [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], warriors organized in military formations, lived in the frontier areas bordering Poland, the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] lands. Although part of them was serving in the Polish army as [[Registered Cossacks]], the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] remained fiercely independent and staged several rebellions against the Poles. In 1648, the peasants of what is now Ukraine joined the Cossacks in rebellion during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. Initially, Cossacks were allied with [[Crimean Tatars]], which had helped them to throw off Polish rule. Once the Poles convinced the Tartars to switch sides, the Zaporozhian Cossacks needed military help to maintain their position.\n\nIn 1648, the  [[Hetman]] (leader) of the [[Zaporozhian host|Zaporozhian Host]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to ally with the Russian [[tsar]], [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer, which was ratified in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654, led to [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|a protracted war between Poland and Russia]]. The [[Truce of Andrusovo]], which did not involve the Hetmanate ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]) as a participating party of the agreement ended the war in 1667. Cossacks considered it as a Moscow betrayal. As a result, it split Ukrainian territory along the [[Dnieper River]], reuniting the western sector (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) with Poland and leaving the eastern sector ([[Left-bank Ukraine]]) self-governing under the sovereignty of the tsar. However, the self-government did not last long and Eastern Ukrainian territory was eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire (after the [[Battle of Poltava]]) during the 18th century.\n\n==Raskol (Schism)==\n{{Main|Raskol}}\n[[File:PhilipandNikon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Patriarch Nikon]] and Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] in the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]]]]\n\nRussia's southwestern expansion, particularly its incorporation of eastern Ukraine, had [[unintended consequence]]s. Most Ukrainians were Orthodox, but their close contact with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Polish also brought them Western intellectual currents. Through the Ukrainian [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Academy in Kiev]], Russia gained links to Polish and Central European influences and to the wider Orthodox world. Although the Ukrainian link induced creativity in many areas, it also weakened traditional Russian religious practices and culture. The Russian Orthodox Church discovered that its isolation from [[Constantinople]] had caused variations to appear between their [[liturgical book]]s and practices.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox patriarch, [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], was determined to bring the Russian texts back into conformity with the [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and practices of the time. But Nikon encountered opposition among the many Russians who viewed the corrections as improper foreign intrusions. When the Orthodox Church forced Nikon's reforms, a schism resulted in 1667. Those who did not accept the reforms came to be called the [[Old Believers]]; they were officially pronounced heretics and were persecuted by the church and the state. The chief opposition figure, the protopope [[Avvakum]], was burned at the stake. The split afterwards became permanent, and many merchants and peasants joined the Old Believers.\n\nThe tsar's court also felt the impact of Ukraine and the West. Kiev was a major transmitter of new ideas and insight through the famed scholarly [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|academy]] that [[Peter Mogila|Metropolitan Mohyla]] founded there in 1631. Other more direct channels to the West opened as international trade increased and more foreigners came to Russia. The Tsar's court was interested in the West's more advanced technology, particularly when military applications were involved. By the end of the 17th century, Ukrainian, Polish, and West European penetration had weakened the Russian cultural synthesis\u2014at least among the elite\u2014and had prepared the way for an even more radical transformation.\n\n==Conquest of Siberia==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n[[File:Surikov Pokoreniye Sibiri Yermakom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Vasily Surikov]]: ''Yermak's Conquest of Siberia'' (1895)]]\nRussia's eastward expansion encountered little resistance. In 1581, the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchant family, interested in the fur trade, hired a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] leader, [[Yermak Timofeyevich]], to lead an expedition into western [[Siberia]]. Yermak defeated the [[Khanate of Sibir]] and claimed the territories west of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh]] Rivers for Russia.\n\nFrom such bases as [[Mangazeya]], merchants, traders, and explorers pushed eastward from the [[Ob River]] to the [[Yenisei River]], then on to the [[Lena River]] and the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Cossack [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the passage between America and Asia. By the middle of the 17th century, Russians had reached the [[Amur River]] and the outskirts of the [[Late Imperial China|Chinese Empire]].\n\nAfter a period of conflict with the [[Qing dynasty]], Russia made peace with [[China]] in 1689. By the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], Russia ceded its claims to the Amur Valley, but it gained access to the region east of [[Lake Baikal]] and the trade route to [[Beijing]]. Peace with China strengthened the initial breakthrough to the Pacific that had been made in the middle of the century.\n\n==Reign of Peter the Great and establishment of the Russian Empire==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Main|Peter the Great|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity Church at Putinki]], an example of the 17th-century Russian [[uzorochye]] style]]\n\n[[Peter the Great]] (1672\u20131725), who became ruler in his own right in 1696, was destined to bring the Tsardom of Russia, which had little contact with Europe and was mostly seen as a regional power, into the mainstream of European culture and politics. After suppressing numerous rebellions with considerable bloodshed, Peter embarked on [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|a tour of Western Europe incognito]]. He became impressed with what he saw and was awakened to the backwardness of Russia. Peter began requiring the nobility to wear Western clothing and shave off their beards, an action that the [[boyar]]s protested bitterly. Arranged marriages among nobility were banned and the Orthodox Church brought under state control. Military academies were established to create a modern European-style army and officer corps in place of the disorganized levies that Muscovite rulers had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes did not win Peter many friends and in fact caused great political division in the country. These along with his notorious cruelties (such as the torture death of [[Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|his own son]] for plotting a rebellion) and the immense human suffering that accompanied many of his projects such as the construction of [[Saint Petersburg]] led many pious Russians to believe that he was the [[Antichrist]]. The [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]] consumed much of Peter's attention for years, however the Swedes were eventually defeated and peace agreed to in 1721. Russia annexed the Baltic coast from Sweden and parts of [[Finland]], which would become the site of the new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. The Russian victory in the Great Northern War marked a watershed in European politics, as it not only brought about the eclipse of Sweden and Poland as great powers, but also Russia's decisive emergence as a permanent factor in Europe. Expansion into Siberia also continued and [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u201323)|war]] with [[Persia]] brought about the acquisition of territory in the [[Caucasus]], although Russia surrendered those gains after Peter's death in 1725.\n\n==State flags==\nThere was no single flag during the Tsardom. Instead, there were multiple flags:\n*Standards used by the Tsar:<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n** '''Standard of the Tsar of Russia''' (1693\u20131700): white-blue-red tricolor with golden [[double-headed eagle]] in the center.<ref name=\"Civil\" /> Replaced by the Imperial standard in 1700 (see below).<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n**'''[[Russian Imperial Standard|Imperial Standard]] of the Tsar of Russia''': black double-headed eagle carrying St. Vladimir Red Coat of Arms, on a golden rectangular field, adopted in 1700 instead of the older white-blue-red Standard of the Tsar of Moscow.<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n*'''Civil Flag''': The early [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Tsars instituted the two-headed eagle Imperial Flag of the Tsar, which origin dates back to 1472, as a Civil Flag, it remained the Civil Flag of Russia until replaced during the Empire in 1858.<ref>Yenne, Bill.
