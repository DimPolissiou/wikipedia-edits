Before Good's work, few hydrogen ion buffers between pH 6 and 8 had been accessible to biologists, and very inappropriate, toxic, reactive and inefficient buffers had often been used. Many Good's buffers became and remain crucial tools in modern biological laboratories.\n\n==Selection criteria==\nGood sought to identify buffering compounds which met several criteria likely to be of value in biological research.\n\n#[[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]]:  Because most biological reactions take place near-neutral [[pH]] between 6 and 8, ideal buffers would have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values in this region to provide maximum buffering capacity there.\n#Solubility:  For ease in handling and because biological systems are in aqueous systems, good solubility in water was required.  Low solubility in [[nonpolarity|nonpolar]] solvents (fats, oils, and organic solvents) was also considered beneficial, as this would tend to prevent the buffer compound from accumulating in nonpolar compartments in biological systems: [[cell membrane]]s and other cell compartments.\n#Membrane impermeability:  Ideally, a buffer will not readily pass through cell membranes, this will also reduce the accumulation of buffer compound within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.\n#Minimal salt effects:  Highly ionic buffers may cause problems or complications in some biological systems.\n#Influences on dissociation:  There should be a minimum influence of buffer concentration, temperature, and ionic composition of the medium on the dissociation of the buffer.\n#Well-behaved cation interactions:  If the buffers form [[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es with [[cation]]ic [[ligand]]s, the complexes formed should remain soluble.  Ideally, at least some of the buffering compounds will not form complexes.\n#Stability:  The buffers should be chemically stable, resisting [[enzyme|enzymatic]] and non-enzymatic degradation.\n#Biochemical inertness: The buffers should not influence or participate in any biochemical reactions.\n#Optical absorbance:  Buffers should not absorb visible or [[ultraviolet]] light at wavelengths longer than 230 [[nanometer|nm]] so as not to interfere with commonly used [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] assays.\n#Ease of preparation:  Buffers should be easily prepared and purified from inexpensive materials.\n\n==List of Good's buffers==\nThe Good's buffers are presented in the table below. The table presents \u201capparent\u201d p''K''<sub>a</sub>s measured by Good's group at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and concentrations of about 100&nbsp;mM. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the buffer's pH when the concentrations of two buffering species are equal, and the buffer solution has the maximum buffering capacity. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub>, and therefore the pH, of any buffer are temperature and concentration dependent. Consequently, the pH of prepared concentrated buffer solutions will change on dilution and with temperature. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> at various concentrations and temperatures may be predicted using online calculators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Biological buffers |url=http://www.reachdevices.com/Protein/BiologicalBuffers.html |publisher=REACH Devices}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Before Good's work, few hydrogen ion buffers between pH 6 and 8 had been accessible to biologists, and very inappropriate, toxic, reactive and inefficient buffers had often been used. Many Good's buffers became and remain crucial tools in modern biological laboratories.\n\n==Selection criteria==\nGood sought to identify buffering compounds which met several criteria likely to be of value in biological research.\n\n#[[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]]:  Because most biological reactions take place near-neutral [[pH]] between 6 and 8, ideal buffers would have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values in this region to provide maximum buffering capacity there.\n#Solubility:  For ease in handling and because biological systems are in aqueous systems, good solubility in water was required.  Low solubility in [[nonpolarity|nonpolar]] solvents (fats, oils, and organic solvents) was also considered beneficial, as this would tend to prevent the buffer compound from accumulating in nonpolar compartments in biological systems: [[cell membrane]]s and other cell compartments.\n#Membrane impermeability:  Ideally, a buffer will not readily pass through cell membranes, this will also reduce the accumulation of buffer compound within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.\n#Minimal salt effects:  Highly ionic buffers may cause problems or complications in some biological systems.\n#Influences on dissociation:  There should be a minimum influence of buffer concentration, temperature, and ionic composition of the medium on the dissociation of the buffer.\n#Well-behaved cation interactions:  If the buffers form [[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es with [[cation]]ic [[ligand]]s, the complexes formed should remain soluble.  Ideally, at least some of the buffering compounds will not form complexes.\n#Stability:  The buffers should be chemically stable, resisting [[enzyme|enzymatic]] and non-enzymatic degradation.\n#Biochemical inertness: The buffers should not influence or participate in any biochemical reactions.\n#Optical absorbance:  Buffers should not absorb visible or [[ultraviolet]] light at wavelengths longer than 230 [[nanometer|nm]] so as not to interfere with commonly used [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] assays.\n#Ease of preparation:  Buffers should be easily prepared and purified from inexpensive materials.\n\n==List of Good's buffers==\nThe Good's buffers are presented in the table below. The table presents \u201capparent\u201d p''K''<sub>a</sub>s measured by Good's group at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and concentrations of about 100&nbsp;mM. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the buffer's pH when the concentrations of two buffering species are equal, and the buffer solution has the maximum buffering capacity. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub>, and therefore the pH, of any buffer are temperature and concentration dependent. Consequently, the pH of prepared concentrated buffer solutions will change on dilution and with temperature. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> at various concentrations and temperatures may be predicted using online calculators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Biological buffers |url=http://www.reachdevices.com/Protein/BiologicalBuffers.html |publisher=REACH Devices}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

No one buffer is truly and completely inert in biological systems. In Good's own words, \"it may be that the quest for universal biological inertness is futile.\"\nOnly three of Good's buffers do not form noticeable complexes with any metals: [[MES (buffer)|MES]], [[MOPS]] and [[PIPES]]. Piperazine-containing buffers ([[PIPES]], [[HEPES]], [[POPSO]] and [[HEPPS (molecule)|EPPS]]) can form radicals and should be avoided in studies of redox processes in biochemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1988|last1=Grady|first1=J.

Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond, Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. They have been recognized as one of the most prominent bands of the [[Garage rock revival|garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival]]s, aiding in the resurgence of [[indie rock]] in [[New York City]].\n\nFollowing the release of their EP ''[[The Modern Age]]'' in January 2001, a bidding war ensued among major labels in order to sign the band. Eventually, [[RCA Records]] signed them and released their debut studio album, ''[[Is This It]]'', later that year. It earned them international recognition, receiving commercial success worldwide and widespread critical acclaim, with the album appearing on multiple year-end and all-time album lists. It was followed up by ''[[Room on Fire]]'' in October 2003 and ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' in January 2006, both receiving similar commercial success. They would enter a hiatus lasting a few years afterward.\n\nToward the end of their original record deal with RCA, the Strokes released two albums in three years with ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' in March 2011 and ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' in March 2013. Both albums received more lukewarm responses from critics, with the latter album being their worst-performing album commercially. They released their first collection of material after their departure from RCA, the ''[[Future Present Past]]'' EP, in June 2016 through Casablancas' independent [[Cult Records]] label.\n\nLater that decade, the Strokes began working with [[Rick Rubin]] on a new album. They would release ''[[The New Abnormal]]'', their first studio album in seven years, in April 2020 through both Cult and RCA. Critics generally regarded the album as a return to form for the band.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''The Modern Age'' EP (1998\u20132001)===\n{{See also|The Modern Age}}\nLead singer-songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] started playing together while attending [[Dwight School]] in [[Manhattan]].

At age 13, Casablancas was sent to [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]], a boarding school in [[Switzerland]], to improve his academic performance. There, he met guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] Later, when Hammond came to New York to attend [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], he shared an apartment with Casablancas. The roommates started a band, first performing at HiFi Bar, then The Spiral, followed by the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, and then at Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. The Mercury Lounge's booker, [[Ryan Gentles]], quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes.

Most of these songs now feature different [[lyrics]]. The band sent a demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 2001).

RCA replaced the track \"New York City Cops\" with \"When It Started\", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the  [[September 11 attacks]]. The track \"New York City Cops\"\u2014featuring the refrain, \"New York City Cops, they ain't too smart\"\u2014was listed as No. 12 on ''New York'' magazine's \"Ultimate New York Playlist\" on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\". During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. ''Is This It'' yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by [[Roman Coppola]].\n\n''Is This It'' has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike.

They also made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and the Strokes recorded the song \"[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]\", released as a B-side on the \"Reptilia\" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n{{Main|First Impressions of Earth}}\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

In February 2006, the Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea.

During this final tour Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond, Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. They have been recognized as one of the most prominent bands of the [[Garage rock revival|garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival]]s, aiding in the resurgence of [[indie rock]] in [[New York City]].\n\nFollowing the release of their EP ''[[The Modern Age]]'' in January 2001, a bidding war ensued among major labels in order to sign the band. Eventually, [[RCA Records]] signed them and released their debut studio album, ''[[Is This It]]'', later that year. It earned them international recognition, receiving commercial success worldwide and widespread critical acclaim, with the album appearing on multiple year-end and all-time album lists. It was followed up by ''[[Room on Fire]]'' in October 2003 and ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' in January 2006, both receiving similar commercial success. They would enter a hiatus lasting a few years afterward.\n\nToward the end of their original record deal with RCA, the Strokes released two albums in three years with ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' in March 2011 and ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' in March 2013. Both albums received more lukewarm responses from critics, with the latter album being their worst-performing album commercially. They released their first collection of material after their departure from RCA, the ''[[Future Present Past]]'' EP, in June 2016 through Casablancas' independent [[Cult Records]] label.\n\nLater that decade, the Strokes began working with [[Rick Rubin]] on a new album. They would release ''[[The New Abnormal]]'', their first studio album in seven years, in April 2020 through both Cult and RCA. Critics generally regarded the album as a return to form for the band.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''The Modern Age'' EP (1998\u20132001)===\nLead singer-songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] started playing together while attending [[Dwight School]] in [[Manhattan]]. Bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] befriended Casablancas while the two attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York]]. At age 13, Casablancas was sent to [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]], a boarding school in [[Switzerland]], to improve his academic performance. There, he met guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] Later, when Hammond came to New York to attend [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], he shared an apartment with Casablancas. The roommates started a band, first performing at HiFi Bar, then The Spiral, followed by the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, and then at Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. The Mercury Lounge's booker, [[Ryan Gentles]], quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes. Music Connection, 26, 32\u201335.</ref>\n\nThe band began rehearsing a fourteen-song set (an early blueprint of the Strokes\u2019 2001 debut, ''Is This It'')\u2014including, \"Alone, Together,\" \"Barely Legal,\" \"[[Last Nite]],\" \"[[The Modern Age]],\" \"New York City Cops,\" \"Soma,\" \"[[Someday (The Strokes song)|Someday]],\" \"Take It or Leave It,\" and \"This Life\" (an early version of \"Trying Your Luck\"). Most of these songs now feature different [[lyrics]]. The band sent a demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 2001). The EP sparked a bidding war among [[record label]]s, the largest for a rock band in years.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|title=the Strokes: \"We Just Do Our Own Thing\"|accessdate=January 23, 2007|year=2001|author=Joe D'Angelo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211070125/http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|archivedate=February 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In August 2001, the Strokes made their first appearance on the cover of the publication ''[[The Fader]]'' in its ninth issue.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | title = Fader 50: New York Rock\n  | magazine = The Fader\n  | date = November 26, 2007\n  | url = http://www.thefader.com/2007/11/26/fader-50-new-york-rock/\n  | accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Is This It''  (2001\u20132002) ===\n[[File:The Strokes by Roger Woolman.jpg|thumb|right|The Strokes in 2002]]\nThe Strokes released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]],'' in the US in October 2001.

RCA replaced the track \"New York City Cops\" with \"When It Started\", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the  [[September 11 attacks]]. The track \"New York City Cops\"\u2014featuring the refrain, \"New York City Cops, they ain't too smart\"\u2014was listed as No. 12 on ''New York'' magazine's \"Ultimate New York Playlist\" on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\". During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. ''Is This It'' yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by [[Roman Coppola]].\n\n''Is This It'' has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike. In 2009, ''NME'' named ''Is This It'' as the Greatest Album of the Decade (2000s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/48412 |title=The Strokes' 'Is This It' tops NME albums of the decade list &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>  The album placed second on a similar list compiled by ''Rolling Stone'' (the same issue featured a list of the '100 Best Songs of the 00's', featuring \"[[Hard to Explain]]\" and \"[[Last Nite]]\"  at Nos.&nbsp;59 and&nbsp;16, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/105081/rolling_stones_100_best_albums_songs_of_the_00s/list/ |title=Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums, Songs Of The '00s |website=Stereogum |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> In January 2011, Rolling Stone conducted a survey among their [[Facebook]] fans to determine the top ten debut albums of all time.

They also made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and the Strokes recorded the song \"[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]\", released as a B-side on the \"Reptilia\" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

In February 2006, the Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour.

During this final tour Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.\n\nPectin is essential to the formation of jelly because it acts as a [[Thickening agent|gelling agent]], meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the bonds they form depend on the pH of the pectin, the optimal pH is between 2.8 and 3.2.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|title=Jams, Jellies and Marmalades|publisher=Herbstreith & Fox|location=Neuenb\u00fcrg/W\u00fcrtt|pages=7, 11\u201313|via=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924110055/http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.<ref name=\"usda\" />\nJelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette \"jelly bag\" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]].\n\n<blockquote>Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit from which it is made. It is tender enough to quiver when moved, but holds angles when cut... Pectin is best extracted from the fruit by heat, therefore cook the fruit until soft before straining to obtain the juice&nbsp;... Pour cooked fruit into a jelly bag which has been wrung out of cold water. Hang up and let drain.

It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, [[bergamot orange|bergamots]] and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]] by its inclusion of fruit peel.\n\nThe benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish [[Bitter orange|Seville orange]], ''Citrus aurantium'' var. ''aurantium'', prized for its high [[pectin]] content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve.  In America, marmalade is sweet.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bubbling Jam.jpg|right|thumb|Jam being made in a pot]]\n\nIn general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104&nbsp;\u00b0C (219&nbsp;\u00b0F),<ref>MookyChick Central. (3 September 2014).

''MookyChick''. Retrieved 11 June 2015.</ref> the [[acid]] and the [[pectin]] in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by [[trial and error]], bringing the mixture to a \"fast rolling [[boiling|boil]]\", watching to see if the seething mass changes [[Texture (food)|texture]], and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.<ref>Ball Blue Book of Preserving, Alltrista Consumer Products, June 2004 {{ISBN|0-9727537-0-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-9727537-0-8}}</ref>\n\nCommercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to {{convert|95|to|100|C|F}} to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.\n\nDuring commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down [[tamper evident|tamper-evident]] safety button when used.\n\n== Packaging ==\nGlass or plastic [[jar]]s are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low [[water activity]] and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.\n\n== Legal definitions ==\n\n=== US FDA definitions ===\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves.

Other names include: ''chutney'', ''confit'', ''conserve'', ''fruit butter'', ''fruit curd'', ''fruit spread'', ''jelly'', and ''[[marmalade]]''.\n\nSome cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit.<ref name=\"joc\" /> In the English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and, when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.<ref>Howard L & Patten M (eds), 1960, The Australian Women's Weekly&nbsp;\u2014 Cookery in colour, Paul Hamlin LTD, London UK, sections956-971</ref>\n\nThe singular ''preserve'' or ''conserve'' is used as a collective noun for high fruit content jam, often for marketing purposes.

A muslin or stockinette \"jelly bag\" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]].\n\n<blockquote>Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit from which it is made.

It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, [[bergamot orange|bergamots]] and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]] by its inclusion of fruit peel.\n\nThe benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish [[Bitter orange|Seville orange]], ''Citrus aurantium'' var. ''aurantium'', prized for its high [[pectin]] content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve.  In America, marmalade is sweet.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bubbling Jam.jpg|right|thumb|Jam being made in a pot]]\n\nIn general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104&nbsp;\u00b0C (219&nbsp;\u00b0F),<ref>MookyChick Central. (3 September 2014).

''MookyChick''. Retrieved 11 June 2015.</ref> the [[acid]] and the [[pectin]] in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by [[trial and error]], bringing the mixture to a \"fast rolling [[boiling|boil]]\", watching to see if the seething mass changes [[Texture (food)|texture]], and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.<ref>Ball Blue Book of Preserving, Alltrista Consumer Products, June 2004 {{ISBN|0-9727537-0-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-9727537-0-8}}</ref>\n\nCommercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to {{convert|95|to|100|C|F}} to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.\n\nDuring commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down [[tamper evident|tamper-evident]] safety button when used.\n\n== Packaging ==\nGlass or plastic [[jar]]s are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low [[water activity]] and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.\n\n== Legal definitions ==\n\n=== US FDA definitions ===\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves. All of these are cooked and pectin-gelled fruit products, but jellies are based entirely on fruit juice or other liquids, while jams and preserves are gelled fruit that may include the seeds and pulp.
