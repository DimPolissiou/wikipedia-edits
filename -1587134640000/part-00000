These two types of cosmetics differ in that concealers tend to be more heavily pigmented, though concealer and foundation are both available in a wide range of [[opacity (optics)|opacity]].

When picking a concealer, people tend to choose one or two shades lighter than their skin tone to better hide their blemishes and dark circles under the eye. Some colors are intended to look like a natural skin tone, while others are meant to cancel out the color of a particular type of blemish. Concealers with yellow undertones are used to hide dark circles. Green and blue can counteract red patches on the skin, such as those caused by pimples, broken veins, or [[rosacea]]. A purple-tinted concealer can make sallow complexions look brighter.\n\n== Different types of concealer and their use ==\nWhen it comes to using concealer there are a variety of different products for different uses. Concealer can work to hide blemishes, mask dark circles, highlight and color correct. \n\n=== Blemish concealer ===\nWhen using a concealer to hide acne you want to make sure to buy a concealer of your skin tone that is thick and rich in pigment.

Its center is the city of [[Zadar]].\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, Zadar County has population of 170,017, accounting for 4.0% of the total Croatia's population.<ref name=\"census2011-counties\"/> [[Croats]] make up the majority with 92.57% of the population, while [[Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Albanians]] and [[Italians]] form the remainder.<ref>{{Croatian Census 2011|E}}</ref>\n[[File:Zadar County Population Pyramid Census 2011 ENG.png|alt=Zadar County Population Pyramid (2011)|none|thumb|350x350px|Zadar County Population Pyramid (2011)]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nAmong the largest towns in the county of Zadar are: [[Zadar]], [[Benkovac]], [[Bibinje]], [[Biograd]], [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]] and [[Pag (town)|Pag]].\n\nThe county of Zadar includes the [[List of islands of Croatia|islands]] of [[Dugi otok]], [[Ugljan]], [[Pasman|Pa\u0161man]], Molat, Lavdara, Zverinac, Vir and most of [[Pag (island)|Pag]], as well as a number of other, smaller islands. It also features the [[Paklenica]] national park.\n\nThe county's [[area]] is 7,854&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 3,646&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land, which accounts for 6.4% of the territory of Croatia. The sea area of the County is 3,632&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (around 12% of the territorial waters) and the insular area is 580&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with more than 300 smaller and larger islands ([[Zadar Archipelago]]). The length of its coastline (including the islands) is 1,300&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/0/ms/pdf/guide/1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716173603/http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/0/ms/pdf/guide/1.pdf|archivedate=16 July 2011|title=International Student Guide|format=PDF|publisher=[[University of Zadar]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinzadar-croatia.com/media/pdf/tourism.pdf|title=Tourism|page=20|publisher=Zadar County|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\nThe County of Zadar plays a leading role in road and railway traffic links between northern and southern Croatia.\n\nThe main road along the [[Adriatic Sea]] passes through the county, as does the new [[A1 (Croatia)|Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway]], completed as far as Split in 2005. The Zagreb-[[Knin]]-Split [[Croatian Railways|railway]] line with branch-lines to Zadar and [[\u0160ibenik]] pass through the County.\n\nMaritime traffic is carried by the coastal route of the Adriatic Sea, by the Zadar-[[Ancona]] international car ferry route which is the shortest link between Central Europe and Italy, via Zagreb and Zadar to Rome and southward. Another route by which intensive traffic is carried is Zadar - Maslenica Bridge - St. Rok Tunnel - Zagreb.\n\nThe Zadar Airport has recently been reconstructed and modernised. With runway improvements still to be undertaken it will eventually have the capacity to handle jumbo-jets.\n\nThere is also a very frequent maritime passenger port in the town of Zadar and the cargo maritime port in the [[Gazenica]] area whose current manipulative capacity amounts to one million tonnes per year. A construction of a wharf would raise this significantly. The port's manipulative and warehouse capacities are used only in part.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Ravni Kotari area constitutes the greater part of the County's inland, containing most of the cultivated farmland and towns having industry, crafts, trade and traffic development potential.\n\nTourism is one of the County's most important industries, owing to its geographical position, mild climate, indented coast, clear sea, numerous bays, inlets and beaches on 1,300&nbsp;km of the sea coast and islands. Tourist amenities of the Zadar County are also the areas of outstanding natural beauty: the [[Velebit]], Tela\u0161\u010dica and [[Paklenica]] and adjacent [[Krka National Park|Krka]] and [[Kornati]] national parks in the south and the [[Plitvice Lakes]] national park in the north.\n\n==Administrative division==\n\nZadar County is divided into:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* City\n** [[Zadar]]\n* Towns\n** [[Benkovac]]\n** [[Biograd na Moru]]\n** [[Nin, Zadar County|Nin]]\n** [[Obrovac, Zadar County|Obrovac]]\n** [[Pag (town)|Pag]]\n* Municipalities\n** [[Bibinje]]\n** [[Galovac, Zadar County|Galovac]]\n** [[Gra\u010dac]]\n** [[Jasenice, Croatia|Jasenice]]\n** [[Kali, Croatia|Kali]]\n** [[Kolan]] (since 2003)\n** [[Kru\u0161evo, Croatia|Kru\u0161evo]]\n** [[Kukljica]]\n** [[Li\u0161ane Ostrovi\u010dke]]\n** [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]]\n** [[Pako\u0161tane]]\n** [[Pa\u0161man]]\n** [[Petr\u010dane]]\n** [[Pola\u010da, Zadar County|Pola\u010da]]\n** [[Poli\u010dnik]]\n** [[Posedarje]]\n** [[Povljane]]\n** [[Preko]]\n** [[Privlaka, Zadar County|Privlaka]]\n** [[Ra\u017eanac]]\n** [[Sali, Croatia|Sali]]\n** [[Stankovci]]\n** [[Starigrad, Zadar County|Starigrad]]\n** [[Suko\u0161an]]\n** [[Sveti Filip i Jakov]]\n** [[\u0160kabrnja]]\n** [[Tkon]]\n** [[Vir]]\n** [[Vrsi]] (since 2006)\n** [[Zemunik Donji]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==County government==\n\nSee [[County (Croatia)#Organization|organization of Croatian counties]].\n[[File:Croatia Zadar County Assembly 2017.svg|alt=The Assembly of Zadar County|thumb|500x500px|The Assembly of Zadar County]]\n{{As of|2014}}, the [[List of prefects of the Zadar County|\u017dupan]] is Bo\u017eidar Longin of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zadarska-zupanija.hr/index.php/page/zupan-stipe-zrilic|title=\u017dupan Stipe Zrili\u0107|work=zadarska-zupanija.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> and the county assembly's 42 representatives are affiliated as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zadarska-zupanija.hr/images/stories/dokumenti/POPIS_VIJECNIKA_Politicka_stranka.pdf|title=Vije\u0107nici \u017dupanijske skup\u0161tine Zadarske \u017eupanije|work=zadarska-zupanija.hr|language=Croatian|format=PDF|accessdate=27 March 2014}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Croatian Democratic Union: 15\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP): 8\n* [[Croatian Party of Rights dr.

The length of its coastline (including the islands) is 1,300&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/0/ms/pdf/guide/1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716173603/http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/0/ms/pdf/guide/1.pdf|archivedate=16 July 2011|title=International Student Guide|format=PDF|publisher=[[University of Zadar]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinzadar-croatia.com/media/pdf/tourism.pdf|title=Tourism|page=20|publisher=Zadar County|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\nThe County of Zadar plays a leading role in road and railway traffic links between northern and southern Croatia.\n\nThe main road along the [[Adriatic Sea]] passes through the county, as does the new [[A1 (Croatia)|Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway]], completed as far as Split in 2005. The Zagreb-[[Knin]]-Split [[Croatian Railways|railway]] line with branch-lines to Zadar and [[\u0160ibenik]] pass through the County.\n\nMaritime traffic is carried by the coastal route of the Adriatic Sea, by the Zadar-[[Ancona]] international car ferry route which is the shortest link between Central Europe and Italy, via Zagreb and Zadar to Rome and southward. Another route by which intensive traffic is carried is Zadar - Maslenica Bridge - St. Rok Tunnel - Zagreb.\n\nThe Zadar Airport has recently been reconstructed and modernised. With runway improvements still to be undertaken it will eventually have the capacity to handle jumbo-jets.\n\nThere is also a very frequent maritime passenger port in the town of Zadar and the cargo maritime port in the [[Gazenica]] area whose current manipulative capacity amounts to one million tonnes per year. A construction of a wharf would raise this significantly. The port's manipulative and warehouse capacities are used only in part.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Park prirode Velebit - Krupa.jpg|thumb|[[Krupa River]] in Velebit nature park]]\nThe Ravni Kotari area constitutes the greater part of the County's inland, containing most of the cultivated farmland and towns having industry, crafts, trade and traffic development potential.\n\nTourism is one of the County's most important industries, owing to its geographical position, mild climate, indented coast, clear sea, numerous bays, inlets and beaches on 1,300&nbsp;km of the sea coast and islands. Tourist amenities of the Zadar County are also the areas of outstanding natural beauty: the [[Velebit]], Tela\u0161\u010dica and [[Paklenica]] and adjacent [[Krka National Park|Krka]] and [[Kornati]] national parks in the south and the [[Plitvice Lakes]] national park in the north.\n\n==Administrative division==\n\nZadar County is divided into:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* City\n** [[Zadar]]\n* Towns\n** [[Benkovac]]\n** [[Biograd na Moru]]\n** [[Nin, Zadar County|Nin]]\n** [[Obrovac, Zadar County|Obrovac]]\n** [[Pag (town)|Pag]]\n* Municipalities\n** [[Bibinje]]\n** [[Galovac, Zadar County|Galovac]]\n** [[Gra\u010dac]]\n** [[Jasenice, Croatia|Jasenice]]\n** [[Kali, Croatia|Kali]]\n** [[Kolan]] (since 2003)\n** [[Kru\u0161evo, Croatia|Kru\u0161evo]]\n** [[Kukljica]]\n** [[Li\u0161ane Ostrovi\u010dke]]\n** [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]]\n** [[Pako\u0161tane]]\n** [[Pa\u0161man]]\n** [[Petr\u010dane]]\n** [[Pola\u010da, Zadar County|Pola\u010da]]\n** [[Poli\u010dnik]]\n** [[Posedarje]]\n** [[Povljane]]\n** [[Preko]]\n** [[Privlaka, Zadar County|Privlaka]]\n** [[Ra\u017eanac]]\n** [[Sali, Croatia|Sali]]\n** [[Stankovci]]\n** [[Starigrad, Zadar County|Starigrad]]\n** [[Suko\u0161an]]\n** [[Sveti Filip i Jakov]]\n** [[\u0160kabrnja]]\n** [[Tkon]]\n** [[Vir]]\n** [[Vrsi]] (since 2006)\n** [[Zemunik Donji]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==County government==\n\nSee [[County (Croatia)#Organization|organization of Croatian counties]].\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the [[List of prefects of the Zadar County|\u017dupan]] is Bo\u017eidar Longin of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zadarska-zupanija.hr/index.php/page/zupan-stipe-zrilic|title=\u017dupan Stipe Zrili\u0107|work=zadarska-zupanija.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> and the county assembly's 42 representatives are affiliated as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zadarska-zupanija.hr/images/stories/dokumenti/POPIS_VIJECNIKA_Politicka_stranka.pdf|title=Vije\u0107nici \u017dupanijske skup\u0161tine Zadarske \u017eupanije|work=zadarska-zupanija.hr|language=Croatian|format=PDF|accessdate=27 March 2014}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Croatian Democratic Union: 15\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP): 8\n* [[Croatian Party of Rights dr.

{"title_page": "Key signature", "text_new": "{{For|use in cryptography|Key signature (cryptography)}}\n[[File:B-flat-major g-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[B-flat major|B{{flat}} major]] / [[G minor]] with two flats placed after the clef.]]\n\nIn [[musical notation]], a '''key signature''' is a set of [[Sharp (music)|p]] ({{Music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{Music|b}}), and rarely, [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{Music|natural}}) symbols placed together on the [[staff (music)|staff]].  Key signatures are generally written immediately after the [[clef]] at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a [[Sheet music|score]], notably after a [[Bar (music)|double barline]].\n\nA key signature designates [[note (music)|note]]s that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding [[natural sign|natural]] notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.  A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one [[semitone]] above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.  Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble staff]] applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAn [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] is an exception to the key signature, applying only to the measure and octave in which it appears.\n\nAlthough a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures\u2014ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the [[circle of fifths|note a perfect fifth below or above]], respectively, the previous one\u2014is assumed in much of this article.  A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve [[pitch class]]es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.\n\nEach [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,<ref>Schulenberg, David. ''Music of the Baroque''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4x3aKvOQWAC&pg=PA72&vq=%22the+key+of+a+baroque+work%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=ACfU3U3x7lhOyyIiT-O_HsTZlZxw8FrkSA p. 72.]. \"(\u2026) to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature.\"</ref> or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.<ref>Cooper, David. ''The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzrfncNnr4cC&pg=PA25-IA13&vq=%22In+a+few+cases+Petrie+has+given+what+is+clearly+a+modal+melody+a+key+signature+which+suggests+that+it+is+actally+in+a+minor+key%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=ACfU3U0BqVPTuQnnaH32iLpCvrYnyT143Q p. 22]. \"In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, ''Banish Misfortune'' is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode.\"</ref>\n\nLater on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas.  For example, in his [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 31 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 110]], the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A{{music|flat}} minor and has a significant modulation to C{{music|flat}} major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.  (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)\n\n== Conventions ==\n\n[[File:ks1.gif|thumb|right|200px|1. [[B major]] scale: no key signature; accidentals required throughout]]\n{{anchor|scale2}}[[File:ks2.gif|thumb|right|200px|2. [[B major]] scale: key signature; accidentals not needed]]\n\nIn principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern [[Music notation#Modern notation|music notation]]. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an [[F\u266f (musical note)|F-sharp]],<ref name=\"orderofsharp\">|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-read-key-signatures.html |title=How to Read Key Signatures|accessdate=29 January 2014</ref> which corresponds to a [[G major]] or an [[E minor]] key.\n\nHowever, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this.  This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C{{music|sharp}} or E{{music|flat}}), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|flat}}).  Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], for example.\n\nThe effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any [[octave]] will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in [[#scale2|scale 2]] illustrated \u2013 the next-to-last note \u2013 is played as an A{{music|sharp}} even though the A{{music|sharp}} in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).<ref name=\"orderofsharp\" />\n\nIn a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:\n* If an instrument is a [[transposing instrument]].\n* If an instrument is a [[percussion instrument]] with indeterminate pitch.\n* Composers usually omit the key signature for [[timpani]] parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a [[perfect fourth]] apart (dominant on the low drum and tonic on the high drum), the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. \"timpani in D\u2013A\", if they were tuned A (low drum) and D (high drum).\n* Composers may omit the key signature for [[French horn|horn]] and occasionally [[trumpet]] parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when [[Crook (music)|crooks]] would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n* On occasion, in more modern works, instruments may be notated in different keys even when they are not transposing instruments, because the music is [[polytonal]] and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.\n\n[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Circle of fifths]] showing [[major key|major]] and [[minor key]]s and their signatures]]\n\n=== Notational conventions ===\n\nThe convention for the notation of key signatures follows the [[circle of fifths]]. Starting from [[C major]] (or equivalently [[A minor]]) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's [[leading note]] (seventh degree) for major keys or [[supertonic]] (second degree) for minor keys. Thus [[G major]] ([[E minor]]) has one sharp which is on the F; then [[D major]] ([[B minor]]) has two sharps on F and C and so on.\n\nSimilarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the [[subdominant]] (fourth degree) for major keys or [[submediant]] (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus [[F major]] ([[D minor]]) has one flat which is on the B; then [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] ([[G minor]]) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.\n\nPut another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the ''empty'' signature of C major (A minor).\n\nCorollaries:\n\n* Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major (A minor). Further such raising adds sharps as described above.\n* Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.\n* When the process of raising by a fifth (adding a sharp) produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the [[enharmonic equivalent]] key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F{{music|sharp}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;G{{music|flat}}, but may also be at C{{music|sharp}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;D{{music|flat}} or B&nbsp;=&nbsp;C{{music|flat}}. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.\n\nThe relative minor is a [[minor third]] down from the major, regardless of whether it is a ''flat'' or a ''sharp'' key signature.\n\nThe key signatures with seven flats ({{Music|flat}}) and seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|#}} major]] (seven sharps) is more simply represented as [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone [[equal temperament]]) the same, because C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} are enharmonically the same note. Pieces ''are'' written in these ''extreme'' sharp or flat keys, however: for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of [[The Well-Tempered Clavier]] [[List of compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach#The Well-Tempered Clavier .28846.E2.80.93893.29|BWV 848]] is in C{{music|#}} major. The modern musical ''[[Seussical]]'' by [[Stephen Flaherty|Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens|Ahrens]] also has several songs written in these extreme keys.\n\nKey signatures can be further extended through [[double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s (for example, a piece in the key of G{{music|#}} major can be expressed with a double sharp on F{{music|x}} and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G{{music|#}}, the same passage could be expressed in A{{music|b}} with only four flats).\n\n[[File:Natural key signature example.png|thumb|Natural key signature: a key signature with seven [[Natural (music)|naturals]] ({{Music|natural}}) used to cancel the seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) of the previous signature.]]\nThe key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a [[measure (music)|measure]], simply by notating the new signature; although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature.{{Citation needed|date 2019-1130|date=November 2019}} If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.\n\n=== Variants of standard conventions ===\n\nIn traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.\n\nSimilarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.\n\nWhen the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.\n\nAt one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a [[barline|double barline]] (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.\n\nIf both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.\n\nIn key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.\n\nThe A{{music|sharp}} which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]'', in the third section, \"Pines of the Janiculum\" (which is in [[B major]]), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.\n\nIn the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F{{music|flat}} may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]]'s ''[[Iberia (Alb\u00e9niz)|Iberia]]'': first movement, \"Evocaci\u00f3n\", which is in [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}}]] minor.\n\n==Major scale structure==\nExcept for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, \"sharp key signatures\" (\"sharp keys\") and \"flat key signatures\" (\"flat keys\"), so called because they contain only one or other.<ref name=\"Schonbrun\">Schonbrun, Marc (2005).

They are convenient principally for [[diatonic]] or [[tonality|tonal]] music.\n\nThe key signature defines the [[diatonic scale]] that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most [[scale (music)|scales]] require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G [[major scale]] is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.\n\nIn any case, more extensive pieces often change key (''[[modulation (music)|modulate]]'') during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.\n\n[[File:GottesZeit.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106|Bach Cantata 106]] is almost entirely in E{{music|flat}} major, but has only two flats, not three, in the key signature {{audio|GottesZeit.mid|Play}}]]\n\nThe [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] has no key signature, leading it to be called the ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', but it is still in D minor; the B{{music|flat}}s that occur in the piece are written with [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]].\n\n===Additional terminology===\nKeys which are associated with the same key signature are called [[relative minor/major|relative keys]].\n\nWhen [[musical mode]]s, such as [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called ''transposed modes''.\n\n== Exceptions ==<!--[[Unusual key signature]] redirects directly here.-->\n\n[[File:D Freygish Noteworthy Composer.png|thumb|D [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]] scale {{audio|D Freygish.mid|Play}}]]\n\nExceptions to [[Common practice period|common-practice-period]] use may be found in [[Klezmer]] scales, such as [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish (Phrygian)]]. In the 20th century, composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Frederic Rzewski|Rzewski]] (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the [[musical mode|standard order]].\n\nBecause of the limitations of the traditional [[Great Highland Bagpipe|highland bagpipe]] scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual \nF{{music|#}} and C{{music|#}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond/Bagpipes#Bagpipes\n| title       = GNU LilyPond \u2014 Notation Reference\n| last1       = Nienhuys\n| first1      = Han-Wen\n| last2       = Nieuwenhuizen\n| first2      = Jan\n| authorlink1 = Han-Wen Nienhuys\n| authorlink2 = Jan Nieuwenhuizen\n| year        = 2009\n| at          = 2.6.2 Bagpipes\n| accessdate  = 2010-03-28\n| quote       = Bagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that isn\u2019t really true).

Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E{{music|b}} (right hand), and F{{music|b}} and G{{music|b}} (left hand) used for the E{{music|b}} diminished (E{{music|b}} [[octatonic scale|octatonic]]) scale in Bart\u00f3k's ''Crossed Hands'' (no. 99, vol. 4, ''[[Mikrokosmos (B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k)|Mikrokosmos]]''), or the B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}} and F{{music|#}}<!--yes, sharp--> used for the D [[Phrygian dominant scale]] in [[Frederic Rzewski]]'s ''God to a Hungry Child''.\n\nThe absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major&nbsp;/ A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be [[Musical mode|modal]] or [[atonality|atonal]]. An example is Bart\u00f3k's [[Piano Sonata (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Sonata]], which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.\n\nIf not bound by common practice conventions, [[microtonal music|microtones]] can also be notated in a key signature; which [[List of musical symbols#Quarter tones|microtonal symbols]] are used depends on the system.\n\nThe [[common practice period]] conventions are so firmly established that some [[scorewriter|musical notation programs]] have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe use of a one-flat signature developed in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.<ref>\"Key Signature\", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.</ref>\n\nWhen signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a '''partial signature''' or '''conflicting signature'''. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.<ref>\"Partial Signature\", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.</ref> The 16th-century motet ''Absolon fili mi'' by [[Pierre de La Rue]] (formerly attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]]) features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.\n\nBaroque music written in [[minor key]]s often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A{{music|flat}} would frequently have to be sharpened to A{{music|natural}} in the [[minor scale|ascending melodic minor scale]], as would the B{{music|flat}}).\n\n== Table ==\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n!Key signature\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:Treble clef with empty staff.svg|100px|C Major key signature]]<br>no sharps or flats\n| [[C major]]\n| [[A minor]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n!Key signature\n!Added {{music|sharp}}\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n!Key signature\n!Added {{music|flat}}\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:G-major e-minor.svg|100px|G Major key signature]]<br>1 sharp\n| F{{music|sharp}}\n| [[G major]]\n| [[E minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:F-major d-minor.svg|100px|F Major key signature]]<br>1 flat\n| B{{music|flat}}\n| [[F major]]\n| [[D minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:D-major h-minor.svg|100px|D Major key signature]]<br>2 sharps\n| C{{music|sharp}}\n| [[D major]]\n| [[B minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:B-flat-major g-minor.svg|100px|B-flat Major key signature]]<br>2 flats\n| E{{music|flat}}\n| [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[G minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|100px|A Major key signature]]<br>3 sharps\n| G{{music|sharp}}\n| [[A major]]\n| [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:E-flat-major c-minor.svg|100px|E-flat Major key signature]]<br>3 flats\n| A{{music|flat}}\n| [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[C minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:E-major c-sharp-minor.svg|100px|E Major key signature]]<br>4 sharps\n| D{{music|sharp}}\n| [[E major]]\n| [[C-sharp minor|C{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:A-flat-major f-minor.svg|100px|A-flat Major key signature]]<br>4 flats\n| D{{music|flat}}\n| [[A-flat major|A{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[F minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:B-major g-sharp-minor.svg|100px|B Major key signature]]<br>5 sharps\n| A{{music|sharp}}\n| [[B major]]\n| [[G-sharp minor|G{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:D-flat-major b-flat-minor.svg|100px|D-flat Major key signature]]<br>5 flats\n| G{{music|flat}}\n| [[D-flat major|D{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[B-flat minor|B{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:F-sharp-major d-sharp-minor.svg|100px|F-sharp Major key signature]]<br>6 sharps\n| E{{music|sharp}}\n| [[F-sharp major|F{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| [[D-sharp minor|D{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:G-flat-major e-flat-minor.svg|100px|G-flat Major key signature]]<br>6 flats\n| C{{music|flat}}\n| [[G-flat major|G{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[E-flat minor|E{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px|C-sharp Major key signature]]<br>7 sharps\n| B{{music|sharp}}\n| [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| [[A-sharp minor|A{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px|C-flat Major key signature]]<br>7 flats\n| F{{music|flat}}\n| [[C-flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Key signature names and translations]]\n* [[Major and minor]]\n* [[Parallel key]]\n* [[Relative key]]\n* [[Theoretical key]]\n* [[Universal key]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Musical key}}\n{{Musical notation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Key Signature}}\n[[Category:Musical notation]]\n\n[[fi:S\u00e4vellaji#Etumerkint\u00e4]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|use in cryptography|Key signature (cryptography)}}\n[[File:B-flat-major g-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[B-flat major|B{{flat}} major]] / [[G minor]] with two flats placed after the clef.]]\n\nIn [[musical notation]], a '''key signature''' is a set of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{Music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{Music|b}}), and rarely, [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{Music|natural}}) symbols placed together on the [[staff (music)|staff]].  Key signatures are generally written immediately after the [[clef]] at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a [[Sheet music|score]], notably after a [[Bar (music)|double barline]].\n\nA key signature designates [[note (music)|note]]s that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding [[natural sign|natural]] notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.  A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one [[semitone]] above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.  Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble staff]] applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAn [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] is an exception to the key signature, applying only to the measure and octave in which it appears.\n\nAlthough a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures\u2014ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the [[circle of fifths|note a perfect fifth below or above]], respectively, the previous one\u2014is assumed in much of this article.  A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve [[pitch class]]es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.\n\nEach [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,<ref>Schulenberg, David. ''Music of the Baroque''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4x3aKvOQWAC&pg=PA72&vq=%22the+key+of+a+baroque+work%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=ACfU3U3x7lhOyyIiT-O_HsTZlZxw8FrkSA p. 72.]. \"(\u2026) to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature.\"</ref> or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.<ref>Cooper, David. ''The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005.

For example, ''Banish Misfortune'' is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode.\"</ref>\n\nLater on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas.  For example, in his [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 31 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 110]], the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A{{music|flat}} minor and has a significant modulation to C{{music|flat}} major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.  (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)\n\n== Conventions ==\n\n[[File:ks1.gif|thumb|right|200px|1. [[B major]] scale: no key signature; accidentals required throughout]]\n{{anchor|scale2}}[[File:ks2.gif|thumb|right|200px|2. [[B major]] scale: key signature; accidentals not needed]]\n\nIn principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern [[Music notation#Modern notation|music notation]]. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an [[F\u266f (musical note)|F-sharp]],<ref name=\"orderofsharp\">|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-read-key-signatures.html |title=How to Read Key Signatures|accessdate=29 January 2014</ref> which corresponds to a [[G major]] or an [[E minor]] key.\n\nHowever, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this.  This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C{{music|sharp}} or E{{music|flat}}), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|flat}}).  Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], for example.\n\nThe effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any [[octave]] will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in [[#scale2|scale 2]] illustrated \u2013 the next-to-last note \u2013 is played as an A{{music|sharp}} even though the A{{music|sharp}} in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).<ref name=\"orderofsharp\" />\n\nIn a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:\n* If an instrument is a [[transposing instrument]].\n* If an instrument is a [[percussion instrument]] with indeterminate pitch.\n* Composers usually omit the key signature for [[timpani]] parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a [[perfect fourth]] apart (dominant on the low drum and tonic on the high drum), the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. \"timpani in D\u2013A\", if they were tuned A (low drum) and D (high drum).\n* Composers may omit the key signature for [[French horn|horn]] and occasionally [[trumpet]] parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when [[Crook (music)|crooks]] would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n* On occasion, in more modern works, instruments may be notated in different keys even when they are not transposing instruments, because the music is [[polytonal]] and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.\n\n[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Circle of fifths]] showing [[major key|major]] and [[minor key]]s and their signatures]]\n\n=== Notational conventions ===\n\nThe convention for the notation of key signatures follows the [[circle of fifths]]. Starting from [[C major]] (or equivalently [[A minor]]) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's [[leading note]] (seventh degree) for major keys or [[supertonic]] (second degree) for minor keys. Thus [[G major]] ([[E minor]]) has one sharp which is on the F; then [[D major]] ([[B minor]]) has two sharps on F and C and so on.\n\nSimilarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the [[subdominant]] (fourth degree) for major keys or [[submediant]] (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus [[F major]] ([[D minor]]) has one flat which is on the B; then [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] ([[G minor]]) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.\n\nPut another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the ''empty'' signature of C major (A minor).\n\nCorollaries:\n\n* Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major (A minor). Further such raising adds sharps as described above.\n* Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.\n* When the process of raising by a fifth (adding a sharp) produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the [[enharmonic equivalent]] key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F{{music|sharp}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;G{{music|flat}}, but may also be at C{{music|sharp}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;D{{music|flat}} or B&nbsp;=&nbsp;C{{music|flat}}. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.\n\nThe relative minor is a [[minor third]] down from the major, regardless of whether it is a ''flat'' or a ''sharp'' key signature.\n\nThe key signatures with seven flats ({{Music|flat}}) and seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|#}} major]] (seven sharps) is more simply represented as [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone [[equal temperament]]) the same, because C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} are enharmonically the same note. Pieces ''are'' written in these ''extreme'' sharp or flat keys, however: for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of [[The Well-Tempered Clavier]] [[List of compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach#The Well-Tempered Clavier .28846.E2.80.93893.29|BWV 848]] is in C{{music|#}} major. The modern musical ''[[Seussical]]'' by [[Stephen Flaherty|Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens|Ahrens]] also has several songs written in these extreme keys.\n\nKey signatures can be further extended through [[double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s (for example, a piece in the key of G{{music|#}} major can be expressed with a double sharp on F{{music|x}} and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G{{music|#}}, the same passage could be expressed in A{{music|b}} with only four flats).\n\n[[File:Natural key signature example.png|thumb|Natural key signature: a key signature with seven [[Natural (music)|naturals]] ({{Music|natural}}) used to cancel the seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) of the previous signature.]]\nThe key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a [[measure (music)|measure]], simply by notating the new signature; although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature.{{Citation needed|date 2019-1130|date=November 2019}} If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.\n\n=== Variants of standard conventions ===\n\nIn traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.\n\nSimilarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.\n\nWhen the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.\n\nAt one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a [[barline|double barline]] (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.\n\nIf both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.\n\nIn key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.\n\nThe A{{music|sharp}} which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]'', in the third section, \"Pines of the Janiculum\" (which is in [[B major]]), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.\n\nIn the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F{{music|flat}} may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]]'s ''[[Iberia (Alb\u00e9niz)|Iberia]]'': first movement, \"Evocaci\u00f3n\", which is in [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}}]] minor.\n\n==Major scale structure==\nExcept for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, \"sharp key signatures\" (\"sharp keys\") and \"flat key signatures\" (\"flat keys\"), so called because they contain only one or other.<ref name=\"Schonbrun\">Schonbrun, Marc (2005).

They are convenient principally for [[diatonic]] or [[tonality|tonal]] music.\n\nThe key signature defines the [[diatonic scale]] that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most [[scale (music)|scales]] require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G [[major scale]] is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.\n\nIn any case, more extensive pieces often change key (''[[modulation (music)|modulate]]'') during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.\n\n[[File:GottesZeit.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106|Bach Cantata 106]] is almost entirely in E{{music|flat}} major, but has only two flats, not three, in the key signature {{audio|GottesZeit.mid|Play}}]]\n\nThe [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] has no key signature, leading it to be called the ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', but it is still in D minor; the B{{music|flat}}s that occur in the piece are written with [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]].\n\n===Additional terminology===\nKeys which are associated with the same key signature are called [[relative minor/major|relative keys]].\n\nWhen [[musical mode]]s, such as [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called ''transposed modes''.\n\n== Exceptions ==<!--[[Unusual key signature]] redirects directly here.-->\n\n[[File:D Freygish Noteworthy Composer.png|thumb|D [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]] scale {{audio|D Freygish.mid|Play}}]]\n\nExceptions to [[Common practice period|common-practice-period]] use may be found in [[Klezmer]] scales, such as [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish (Phrygian)]]. In the 20th century, composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Frederic Rzewski|Rzewski]] (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the [[musical mode|standard order]].\n\nBecause of the limitations of the traditional [[Great Highland Bagpipe|highland bagpipe]] scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual \nF{{music|#}} and C{{music|#}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond/Bagpipes#Bagpipes\n| title       = GNU LilyPond \u2014 Notation Reference\n| last1       = Nienhuys\n| first1      = Han-Wen\n| last2       = Nieuwenhuizen\n| first2      = Jan\n| authorlink1 = Han-Wen Nienhuys\n| authorlink2 = Jan Nieuwenhuizen\n| year        = 2009\n| at          = 2.6.2 Bagpipes\n| accessdate  = 2010-03-28\n| quote       = Bagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that isn\u2019t really true). However, since that is the only key that can be used, the key signature is normally not written out. \n}}</ref> (In this case the pipes are incapable of playing F{{music|natural}} and C{{music|natural}} so it is not necessary to specify the sharps.)\n\n[[File:Earlykeysig.png|thumb|right|80px|Variant key signatures in a [[Tomas Luis de Victoria|Victoria]] motet. In the ''superius'' (soprano) part the E{{music|flat}} appears first, and in two other parts a flat occurs in two octaves.]]\n\n=== Unusual signatures ===\n{{further information|Anhemitonic scale#Modes of the ancohemitonic heptatonic scales and the key signature system}}\n\nThe above 15 key signatures only express the diatonic scale, and are therefore sometimes called ''standard key signatures''. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E{{music|b}} (right hand), and F{{music|b}} and G{{music|b}} (left hand) used for the E{{music|b}} diminished (E{{music|b}} [[octatonic scale|octatonic]]) scale in Bart\u00f3k's ''Crossed Hands'' (no. 99, vol. 4, ''[[Mikrokosmos (B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k)|Mikrokosmos]]''), or the B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}} and F{{music|#}}<!--yes, sharp--> used for the D [[Phrygian dominant scale]] in [[Frederic Rzewski]]'s ''God to a Hungry Child''.\n\nThe absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major&nbsp;/ A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be [[Musical mode|modal]] or [[atonality|atonal]]. An example is Bart\u00f3k's [[Piano Sonata (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Sonata]], which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.\n\nIf not bound by common practice conventions, [[microtonal music|microtones]] can also be notated in a key signature; which [[List of musical symbols#Quarter tones|microtonal symbols]] are used depends on the system.\n\nThe [[common practice period]] conventions are so firmly established that some [[scorewriter|musical notation programs]] have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe use of a one-flat signature developed in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.<ref>\"Key Signature\", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.</ref>\n\nWhen signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a '''partial signature''' or '''conflicting signature'''. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.<ref>\"Partial Signature\", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.</ref> The 16th-century motet ''Absolon fili mi'' by [[Pierre de La Rue]] (formerly attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]]) features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.\n\nBaroque music written in [[minor key]]s often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A{{music|flat}} would frequently have to be sharpened to A{{music|natural}} in the [[minor scale|ascending melodic minor scale]], as would the B{{music|flat}}).\n\n== Table ==\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n!Key signature\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:Treble clef with empty staff.svg|100px|C Major key signature]]<br>no sharps or flats\n| [[C major]]\n| [[A minor]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n!Key signature\n!Added {{music|sharp}}\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n!Key signature\n!Added {{music|flat}}\n!Major key\n!Minor key\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:G-major e-minor.svg|100px|G Major key signature]]<br>1 sharp\n| F{{music|sharp}}\n| [[G major]]\n| [[E minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:F-major d-minor.svg|100px|F Major key signature]]<br>1 flat\n| B{{music|flat}}\n| [[F major]]\n| [[D minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:D-major h-minor.svg|100px|D Major key signature]]<br>2 sharps\n| C{{music|sharp}}\n| [[D major]]\n| [[B minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:B-flat-major g-minor.svg|100px|B-flat Major key signature]]<br>2 flats\n| E{{music|flat}}\n| [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[G minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|100px|A Major key signature]]<br>3 sharps\n| G{{music|sharp}}\n| [[A major]]\n| [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:E-flat-major c-minor.svg|100px|E-flat Major key signature]]<br>3 flats\n| A{{music|flat}}\n| [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[C minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:E-major c-sharp-minor.svg|100px|E Major key signature]]<br>4 sharps\n| D{{music|sharp}}\n| [[E major]]\n| [[C-sharp minor|C{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:A-flat-major f-minor.svg|100px|A-flat Major key signature]]<br>4 flats\n| D{{music|flat}}\n| [[A-flat major|A{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[F minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:B-major g-sharp-minor.svg|100px|B Major key signature]]<br>5 sharps\n| A{{music|sharp}}\n| [[B major]]\n| [[G-sharp minor|G{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:D-flat-major b-flat-minor.svg|100px|D-flat Major key signature]]<br>5 flats\n| G{{music|flat}}\n| [[D-flat major|D{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[B-flat minor|B{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:F-sharp-major d-sharp-minor.svg|100px|F-sharp Major key signature]]<br>6 sharps\n| E{{music|sharp}}\n| [[F-sharp major|F{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| [[D-sharp minor|D{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:G-flat-major e-flat-minor.svg|100px|G-flat Major key signature]]<br>6 flats\n| C{{music|flat}}\n| [[G-flat major|G{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[E-flat minor|E{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|-\n| align=center|[[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px|C-sharp Major key signature]]<br>7 sharps\n| B{{music|sharp}}\n| [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| [[A-sharp minor|A{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| align=center|[[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px|C-flat Major key signature]]<br>7 flats\n| F{{music|flat}}\n| [[C-flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]\n| [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}} minor]]\n|}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Key signature names and translations]]\n* [[Major and minor]]\n* [[Parallel key]]\n* [[Relative key]]\n* [[Theoretical key]]\n* [[Universal key]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Musical key}}\n{{Musical notation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Key Signature}}\n[[Category:Musical notation]]\n\n[[fi:S\u00e4vellaji#Etumerkint\u00e4]]\n", "name_user": "100.40.189.139", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Because it was not sharp)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature"}

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives.

These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print.

He only had sex with most of them once.{{sfn|Weiss|2004|p=190}} [[Maratha (caste)|Marathas]] captured during their wars with the Mughals had been given to the soldiers of the Mughal Army from the Baloch [[Bugti]] tribe. The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult.<ref name=\"fcbbook1stch\"/> For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In [[1968\u201369 FC Bayern Munich season|1968\u201369 season]], Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the [[1973\u201374 FC Bayern Munich season|1973\u201374 season]], the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> Bayern also wore a ''Rotwein'' coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006\u201307 Champions League]] campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|title=Die vollst\u00e4ndige Trikot-Historie des FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=German|work=stickerfreak|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127161503/http://stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|archivedate=27 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green.

The colours of [[Bavaria]] were included for the first time in 1954.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> The crest from 1906 to 1919 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for ''Fu\u00dfball-Abteilung'', i.e. Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white.

The club began a long and extensive search to find a replacement and eventually [[Niko Kova\u010d]] was presented as Heynckes's successor, signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eintracht Frankfurt's Niko Kovac to succeed Jupp Heynckes as Bayern Munich head coach |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/niko-kovac-to-succeed-jupp-heynckes-as-bayern-munich-coach-478173.jsp |website=Bundesliga.com |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> Heynckes led the club to another championship. In the cup final, Heynckes's last match as coach, Heynckes met his successor on the pitch. Kova\u010d's [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] denied Bayern the title, winning 3\u20131.\n\nKova\u010d's first season at the club started slow with Bayern falling behind [[Borussia Dortmund|Dortmund]] in the league throughout the first half of the season. In contrast to similar situations with [[Louis van Gaal|van Gaal]] and [[Carlo Ancelotti|Ancelotti]] the club's leadership decided to protect their coach from criticisms, however. After the winter break Bayern quickly closed the distance and put themselves first place in the league. In the Champions League the club was eliminated by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|round of 16]], the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarterfinal.

This Bundesliga title was Rib\u00e9ry's ninth and Robben's eighth. A week later, Bayern defeated [[RB Leipzig]] 3-0 in the [[2019 DFB-Pokal Final]]. With the win Bayern won their 19th German Cup and completed their 12th domestic double.\n\n==Kits==\n{{Commons|FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen kits}}\nIn the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult.<ref name=\"fcbbook1stch\"/> For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In [[1968\u201369 FC Bayern Munich season|1968\u201369 season]], Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the [[1973\u201374 FC Bayern Munich season|1973\u201374 season]], the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> Bayern also wore a ''Rotwein'' coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006\u201307 Champions League]] campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|title=Die vollst\u00e4ndige Trikot-Historie des FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=German|work=stickerfreak|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127161503/http://stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|archivedate=27 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the [[2013\u201314 FC Bayern Munich season|2013\u201314 season]], Bayern used an all red home kit with a [[Flag of Bavaria|Bavarian flag]] diamond watermark pattern, a ''[[Lederhosen]]'' inspired white and black ''[[Oktoberfest]]'' away kit, and an all navy blue international kit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Beer-ern Munich: European Champs Get Oktoberfest Uniforms|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bayern-munich-stars-to-wear-lederhosen-inspired-shirts-a-919856.html|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=10 May 2014|work=Der Spiegel|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328111852/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bayern-munich-stars-to-wear-lederhosen-inspired-shirts-a-919856.html|archivedate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at [[1.

Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of [[Bavaria]] were included for the first time in 1954.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> The crest from 1906 to 1919 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for ''Fu\u00dfball-Abteilung'', i.e. Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.<ref name=\"crestcolor\"/> While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre and FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\n\n{{gallery\n|title=Bayern Munich logo history\n|width=120\n|height=100\n|align=center\n|File:FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen (Altes Emblem).png |1900\u20131901\n|File:Logo - Bayern Munchen(1906-1919).gif|1920\u20131924\n|File:Bayern Herb (1923-1954).png|1925\u20131954\n|File:Logo Bayern Munchen(1979-1996).gif|1954\u20131996\n|File:Logo Bayern Munchen(1996-2002).gif|1996\u20132002\n|File:Logo FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen.svg|2002\u20132017\n|File:FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen logo (2017).svg|2017\u2013\n}}\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Model of stadium at Leopoldstrasse.JPG|thumb|Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924]]\n\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of [[Munich]].

This summer art camp and year-long artist residency draws young artists from around the world, and perfects their skills in visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interlochen.org/|title=Interlochen Center for the Arts|website=www.interlochen.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nInterlochen takes its name from the [[Latin]] \"''inter''\", meaning \"between\", and the [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"''lochen''\", meaning lakes.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, members of the [[Odawa]] people lived between the lakes they called ''Wahbekaness'' and ''Wahbekanetta'' (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began [[logging]] and [[Fishing industry|fishing]] industries in the area, and founded the small town of '''Wylie'''. Because of logging, the [[Chicago and West Michigan Railway]] built a line between [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]] and [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]], which met with the [[Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad]]. These railroads intercepted in current-day downtown Interlochen.\n\nAs the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested, until in 1917 the [[Michigan|state of Michigan]] purchased the remaining virgin pines and created [[Interlochen State Park]], the first organized [[state park]] in Michigan (as [[Mackinac Island State Park|Mackinac Island]] was a state park before Interlochen).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 | title=History of Interlochen | publisher=Interlochen Center for the Arts | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015230026/http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded at Interlochen and evolved to become [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]], which includes a summer camp as well as a fine arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of M-137 (designated as a highway to the arts camp in 1930<ref>{{Citation|last=Michigan|title=Official highway service map|date=1927|publisher=The Dept.|language=English|oclc=79754957|last2=State Highway Department|last3=H.M. Gousha Company}}</ref>), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie.\n\nIn the mid 20th century, the railroads that brought students to, and lumber through Interlochen, have been removed. The north-south M&NE railroad was removed in 1934<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/182-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1930s/4427-evolution-map-lower-1934|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1934|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>, and the west-east C&WM railroad removed in 1982<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/187-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1980s/4479-evolution-map-lower-1982|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1982|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>. Today, Interlochen has become noteworthy for its use of ecofriendly alternative transportation methods such as BATA's bike/scooter/skatetoy sharing initiative.\n\n==Geography==\nAs the name suggests, Interlochen is situated between the two lakes of the original Odawa settlement. It is {{convert|14|mi}} southwest of [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] at {{coord|44|38|43|N|85|46|02|W|display=inline}}, and sits at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|841|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 49643.\n\n==Climate==\nInterlochen lies close to the [[45th parallel north]], approximately halfway between the equator and the north pole. It therefore experiences typical [[Northern Michigan]] weather: very cold in the winter, and very warm in the summer. Interlochen is close enough to Lake Michigan that it experiences heavy [[lake-effect snow]], but not close enough to be cooled by the Great Lake's breeze, furthering the extremes of the winter and summer seasons. However, other lake-effect precipitation in the summer is also present, causing lush greenery and magnificent thunderstorms, and making Interlochen picturesque in the summer as well as in the winter. However, to the distress of many longtime resident, Interlochen's recent fast economic growth and resulting construction has caused significant pollution to neighbouring lakes and forests. As a result, the aforementioned picturesque landscapes are temporarily on hold until the next American recession slows Interlochen's highrise development.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census|census]] of 2010, there were 583 people, 240 households, and 142 families residing in the Interlochen CDP. The [[population density]] was 470.0 people per square mile (181.5/km\u00b2). There were 277 housing units at an average density of 223.3 per square mile (86.2/km\u00b2).<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\">{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Interlochen CDP, Michigan| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=December 19, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213134600/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the CDP was 52.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 43.2% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 0.5% [[African-American]] or [[Black people|Black]], 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.9% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]], who can be of any race.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\n==Government==\nThe Village of Interlochen is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] and does not have its own [[local government]], but is governed locally by [[Green Lake Township, Michigan|Green Lake Township]]. The township offices are located in Interlochen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenlaketownship.org/ | title= Green Lake Township Web Site | publisher=Green Lake Township Board | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Some governmental services are also provided by the county.\n[[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] also provides its own form of non-governmental security who provide the community with constant video and motion surveillance that extends from its campus buildings and dorm rooms to the local woods area. The service diligently monitors the students living in the area and provide severe and nonjudicial punishment to those who make minor offences. This service has been controversial in the expulsion of its most talented students, often permanently damaging their artistic careers.\n\n\n==Media==\nInterlochen is home to 88.7 [[WIAA (FM)|WIAA]], which is run by the Interlochen Center for the Arts and operates as Northern Michigan's [[National Public Radio]] affiliate. The station has been under recent controversy due to its daily broadcast of inflated crop yield numbers and documentation of recent arrests, which have been described by some as propaganda by the state.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Quiet Time (84292503).jpeg|thumb|Lake DuBonnet, just northwest of Interlochen]]\n\n=== Highways ===\n\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|31}} runs along the northern edge of Interlochen. The highway mainly parallels the [[Lake Michigan]] shore, and runs for {{convert|356|mi|km}} in a northerly direction from the [[Indiana]]-Michigan state line southwest of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] to its terminus at [[Interstate 75|I-75]] south of [[Mackinaw City]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|137}} is a {{convert|2.89|mi|km|adj=on}} north-south spur between US&nbsp;31 at the north end and [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] and [[Interlochen State Park]] at the southern terminus (the road continues south as Grand Traverse County Road 137, also known as Karlin Road).\n\n===Public transportation===\nInterlochen is served by Traverse City's public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with [[dial-a-ride]] services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel.\n\nGiven the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area's sizeable student population. \n\n===General Aviation===\n[[File:Kresge Auditorium-Interlochen.jpg|thumb|Kresge Auditorium, located within Interlochen Center for the Arts]]\nInterlochen can be reached by any airplane, helicopter or jet propelled airski able to utilize turf runways at the [[Green Lake Airport]] (Y88)\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[List of

This summer art camp and year-long artist residency draws young artists from around the world, and perfects their skills in visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interlochen.org/|title=Interlochen Center for the Arts|website=www.interlochen.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nInterlochen takes its name from the [[Latin]] \"''inter''\", meaning \"between\", and the [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"''lochen''\", meaning lakes.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, members of the [[Odawa]] people lived between the lakes they called ''Wahbekaness'' and ''Wahbekanetta'' (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began [[logging]] and [[Fishing industry|fishing]] industries in the area, and founded the small village of '''Wylie''', one mile south of present-day Interlochen. Because of logging, the [[Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad]] (owned by the Buckley and Douglas Lumber Company of [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]]) extended it's line north from [[Nessen City, Michigan|Nessen City]] and arrived between the lakes in the fall of 1889. Similarly, the [[Chicago and West Michigan Railway]] extended it's line north from [[Baldwin, Michigan|Baldwin]] on it's way to [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] in 1890. The two lines crossed in current-day downtown Interlochen where a depot and [[interlocking]] tower were located. The original townsite, however, was platted just south of the depot along either side of the M&NE rail line in late 1889 or early 1890, with the business district centering on current [[M-137]] and Riley Rd/10th Street.\n\nAs the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested. However, it was predicted from the beginning that the area would become a popular summer resort, and so Buckley and Douglas set aside 186 acres of virgin pines between Duck and Green lakes for preservation. The result was '''Pine Park''', a public retreat boasting virgin forests and pristine lakes. A small railroad depot named Pine Park Station was built. Visitors began flocking to the region during the warmer months to camp, fish, boat, and escape the heat of the crowded cities. Piggybacking on the vacation boom, local businessman Willis Pennington purchased land adjacent to Pine Park on the banks of Green Lake and opened the Pennington Hotel in 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crescendo.interlochen.org/story/timber-tourism-how-conservation-shaped-interlochen-michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1910's, local representatives became worried that Pine Park would soon be logged off and so they lobbied the [[Michigan|Michigan Legislature]] for help. The state ultimately allocated $60,000 in 1917 to purchase the property<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79133_79205_85747_86991_88871_90785---,00.html|title=DNR - Michigan's first state park|website=www.michigan.gov|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, and the newly acquired parkland was dedicated as '''The Pines''', later renamed [[Interlochen State Park]], the first [[state park]] organized by the state of Michigan ([[Mackinac Island State Park|Mackinac Island]] was originally a national park before becoming Michigan's first state park in 1895).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 | title=History of Interlochen | publisher=Interlochen Center for the Arts | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015230026/http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded at Interlochen and evolved to become [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]], which includes a summer camp as well as a fine arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of M-137 (designated as a highway to the arts camp in 1930<ref>{{Citation|last=Michigan|title=Official highway service map|date=1927|publisher=The Dept.|language=English|oclc=79754957|last2=State Highway Department|last3=H.M. Gousha Company}}</ref>), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie.\n\nBy the late 20th century, the railroads that brought students, vacationers, and lumber through Interlochen, had been removed. The north-south M&NE railroad was removed in 1934<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/182-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1930s/4427-evolution-map-lower-1934|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1934|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>, and the west-east C&WM railroad ([[Pere Marquette Railway]] after 1899) removed in 1982<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/187-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1980s/4479-evolution-map-lower-1982|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1982|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>. The area remains a popular vacation spot, with hiking, fishing, camping, boating, swimming, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling the most popular activities.\n\n==Geography==\nAs the name suggests, Interlochen is situated between the two lakes of the original Odawa settlement. It is {{convert|14|mi}} southwest of [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] at {{coord|44|38|43|N|85|46|02|W|display=inline}}, and sits at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|841|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 49643.\n\n==Climate==\nInterlochen lies close to the [[45th parallel north]], approximately halfway between the equator and the north pole. It therefore experiences typical [[Northern Michigan]] weather: very cold in the winter, and very warm in the summer. Interlochen is close enough to Lake Michigan that it experiences heavy [[lake-effect snow]], but not close enough to be cooled by the Great Lake's breeze, furthering the extremes of the winter and summer seasons. However, other lake-effect precipitation in the summer is also present, causing lush greenery and magnificent thunderstorms, and making Interlochen picturesque in the summer as well as in the winter.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census|census]] of 2010, there were 583 people, 240 households, and 142 families residing in the Interlochen CDP. The [[population density]] was 470.0 people per square mile (181.5/km\u00b2). There were 277 housing units at an average density of 223.3 per square mile (86.2/km\u00b2).<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\">{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Interlochen CDP, Michigan| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=December 19, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213134600/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the CDP was 52.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 43.2% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 0.5% [[African-American]] or [[Black people|Black]], 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.9% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]], who can be of any race.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\n==Government==\nThe Village of Interlochen is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] and does not have its own [[local government]], but is governed locally by [[Green Lake Township, Michigan|Green Lake Township]]. The township offices are located in Interlochen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenlaketownship.org/ | title= Green Lake Township Web Site | publisher=Green Lake Township Board | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Some governmental services are also provided by the county.\n\n\n==Media==\nInterlochen is home to 88.7 [[WIAA (FM)|WIAA]], which is run by the Interlochen Center for the Arts and operates as Northern Michigan's [[National Public Radio]] affiliate. \n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Quiet Time (84292503).jpeg|thumb|Lake DuBonnet, just northwest of Interlochen]]\n\n=== Highways ===\n\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|31}} runs along the northern edge of Interlochen. The highway mainly parallels the [[Lake Michigan]] shore, and runs for {{convert|356|mi|km}} in a northerly direction from the [[Indiana]]-Michigan state line southwest of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] to its terminus at [[Interstate 75|I-75]] south of [[Mackinaw City]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|137}} is a {{convert|2.89|mi|km|adj=on}} north-south spur between US&nbsp;31 at the north end and [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] and [[Interlochen State Park]] at the southern terminus (the road continues south as Grand Traverse County Road 137, also known as Karlin Road).\n\n===Public transportation===\nInterlochen is served by Traverse City's public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with [[dial-a-ride]] services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel.\n\nGiven the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area's sizeable student population. \n\n===General Aviation===\n[[Green Lake Airport]] (Y88) is located three miles south of Interlochen.\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[List of boarding schools in the United States]]\n* [[List of lakes of Michigan]]\n* [[Kingsley, Michigan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.interlochenchamber.org/ Interlochen Chamber of Commerce]\n*[http://www.interlochen.org/ Interlochen Center for the Arts]\n*[http://www.ricsfoodcenter.com/ Interlochen Ric's Food Center]\n*[http://www.bata.net/ Bay Area Transportation Authority]\n\n{{Grand Traverse County, Michigan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Grand Traverse County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Traverse City micropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Grand Traverse County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "69.159.18.46", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlochen,_Michigan"}
