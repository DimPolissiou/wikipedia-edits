Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.

After his father's death in 1915 he lived with his mother Rozaliya Feliksovna Gershun. In 1920 he entered the Physics Department of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Peterburg State University]] and graduated in 1924. He then took a position in the State Optical Institute Photometic Laboratory under the direction of Professor S. O. Mayzel'.<ref>S. O. Mayzel', Lighting Engineering in State Optics Institute // XV years of State Optics Institute, 1934</ref>\n\nIn 1934, when the Photometric sector was organised at the State Optical Institute, Gershun took the position of the head of the Lighting Laboratory. His colleagues included well-known physicists M. M. Gurevich (head of the Photometric Laboratory), L. I. Demkin (head of the Color Laboratory), [[Lev Gassovsky]] (head of the Eye Laboratory) and G. K. Ustyugov (head of the Flood Lamp Laboratory). He also worked with D. N. Lazarev, G. N. Rautian, and A. A. Vol'kenshteyn. Their collaborations led progress at the institute in [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], [[lighting technology]], [[colorimetry]], [[ophthalmology]] and the physiology of the eye.\nIn 1937 Gershun received the [[Doctor nauk]] degree.<ref>A. A. Vol'kenshteyn \"Photometry\" // 50 years of State Optical Institute, Machinery Press, 1968.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the State Optical Institute was evacuated to [[Yoshkar-Ola]] (1941\u20131945). During this period Gershun worked on the problems of [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]], camouflage detection and concealed lighting.\n\nAfter the end of [[World War II]] he continued his work on photometric problems and performed theoretical and translational research. He also occupied lecturer positions.\nHe died December 6, 1952 in his office.\n\n==Scientific Work==\n\nGershun's most important pre-war works were devoted to theoretical photometry,<ref>A. A.

After his father's death in 1915 he lived with his mother Rozaliya Feliksovna Gershun. In 1920 he entered the Physics Department of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Peterburg State University]] and graduated in 1924. He then took a position in the State Optical Institute Photometic Laboratory under the direction of Professor S. O. Mayzel'.<ref>S. O. Mayzel', Lighting Engineering in State Optics Institute // XV years of State Optics Institute, 1934</ref>\n\nIn 1934, when the Photometric sector was organised at the State Optical Institute, Gershun took the position of the head of the Lighting Laboratory. His colleagues included well-known physicists M. M. Gurevich (head of the Photometric Laboratory), L. I. Demkin (head of the Color Laboratory), [[Lev Gassovsky]] (head of the Eye Laboratory) and G. K. Ustyugov (head of the Flood Lamp Laboratory). He also worked with D. N. Lazarev, G. N. Rautian, and A. A. Vol'kenshteyn. Their collaborations led progress at the institute in [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], [[lighting technology]], [[colorimetry]], [[ophthalmology]] and the physiology of the eye.\nIn 1937 Gershun received the [[Doctor nauk]] degree.<ref>A. A. Vol'kenshteyn \"Photometry\" // 50 years of State Optical Institute, Machinery Press, 1968.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the State Optical Institute was evacuated to [[Yoshkar-Ola]] (1941\u20131945). During this period Gershun worked on the problems of [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]], camouflage detection and concealed lighting.\n\nAfter the end of [[World War II]] he continued his work on photometric problems and performed theoretical and translational research. He also occupied lecturer positions.\nHe died December 6, 1952 in his office.\n\n==Scientific Work==\n\nGershun's most important pre-war works were devoted to theoretical photometry,<ref>A. A.
