[[Moses of Chorene]] called him \"the wisest, most powerful and bravest of [[Armenians|Armenian]] kings.\"\n\nFrom 553 BC to 521 BC, Armenia was a subject kingdom of the Achaemenid Empire, but when [[Darius I]] was king, he decided to conquer Armenia. He sent an Armenian named [[D\u00e2dar\u0161i]] to stop a revolt against Persian rule, later replacing him with the [[Persian people|Persian]] general, Vaumisa, who defeated the Armenians in 521 BC. Around the same time, another [[Armenians|Armenian]] by the name of [[Arakha]], son of Haldita, claimed to be the son of the last king of [[Babylon]], [[Nabonidus]], and renamed himself [[Nebuchadnezzar IV]].

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African American student to enroll at the College.

Hannah]], became president of the College.\n\nAfter World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory.

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African American student to enroll at the College.

One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory.

He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (''n\u00fctzlich'').<ref>Fernand Goyens, ''Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG'', Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), September 1th 1986 (Special edition), pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Later he elaborated his criticism in ''Economic Theory.

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4). We mention :\n\n* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018Economic Development\u2019'' in ''Joseph Alo\u00efs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed. [[w:de:J\u00fcrgen Backhaus|J. Backhaus]], The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 1, Kluwer, Boston, Dordrecht, London 2003, pp.&nbsp;233\u2013244. M. van Meerhaeghe considers [[Schumpeter]] as \u2018superior\u2019 to [[Keynes]] because of his better knowledge of the economic science and his unsurpassed \u2018History of economic analysis\u2019.\n* ''[[Nietzsche]] and economics'' and ''Nietzsche and business ethics'', in ''Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900.

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''.

Although von Bismarck's position passed through many important alterations, one aim remains unchanged: guarantee the stability and social peace of the state.<ref>[[Patricia Owens (academic)|Patricia Owens]], ''From Bismarck to Petraeus: The question of the social and the Social Question in counterinsurgency'', [[European Journal of International Relations]], 2013, Vol. 19, Iss. 1, p. 148.</ref><ref>Prof. Enrico Colombatto, ''It was the Rule of Law: Will it be the Rule of Judges'', Journal of Entrepreneurial Economy, Vol. XV, Issue I, Podgorica May 2008, p. 32.</ref>\n* ''The international aspects of Justi\u2019s work'', in ''The beginnings of Political Economy. Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi'', ed. J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 7, Springer, New York 2009, pp.&nbsp;99\u2013110. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 9, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;67\u201376. Van Meerhaeghe refutes the idea that [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] would have been a 'famous utopian': no, he was the founder of modern scepticism.  \n* ''Mature Cameralism According to [[w:de:Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]]'', in ''Physiocracy, Antiphysiocracy and Pfeiffer'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 10, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013147. Unfortunately there is a good deal of terminological confusion on display. Cameralism is the German version of mercantilism; trade requires freedom. [[Adam Smith]]'s criticism of mercantilism is wrong.\n* ''The Austrian and German \"Economist\" in the interwar period: international aspects'', in ''The beginnings of Scholarly Economic Journalism'', ed.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich.

After the campaign of 1940 followed about seven months as a prisoner of war in a German camp (an intervention of King Leopold III resulted in the release of the ERM-students).\n\nAt Ghent University (Belgium) van Meerhaeghe obtained a master's degree in Economic Sciences in 1944 (first diet: July) and a Masters in Political Science and Sociology, also in 1944 (second diet: September).

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4). We mention :\n\n* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018Economic Development\u2019'' in ''Joseph Alo\u00efs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed.

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''.

[[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich. In franz\u00f6sischen B\u00fccherbesprechungen gibt man im allgemeinen ein Res\u00fcmee \u00fcber das Buch. Man spendet viel Lob, und man hofft, da\u00df der Kollege dasselbe tun wird, wenn man einmal ebenfalls ein Buch schreibt. In amerikanischen und auch englischen Zeitungen ist das Gegenteil der Fall. Dort ist man ziemlich hart. Man kann dasselbe sagen von Diskussionen und Korreferaten. Es w\u00e4re viel leichter gewesen, hier etwas Generelles zu sagen und darzulegen: \u00ab Ja, ich bin einverstanden met a, b und c. \u00bb Aber f\u00fcr eine Diskussion ist es, glaube ich \u2013 ich sage nicht, da\u00df ich recht habe \u2013 besser, anzugreifen, ein wenig Kritik zu \u00fcben.\"<ref>[[w:de:Hans Karl Schneider (Volkswirt)|Hans K.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown.

Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device.

Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault.

After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi.

Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack.

In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point.

Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom. Tamayo calls Gand\u00eda's communications centre, but the telecommunication cords are cut by Bogot\u00e1 before he can answer. The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] takes over Lisbon's custody, and removes her from the tent.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = Plan Par\u00eds\n| AltTitle        = The Paris Plan\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Berlin confronts Palermo about his feelings towards him, while also revealing his own feelings for Palermo. They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n''[[Money Heist]]'' ({{lang-es|La casa de papel}}, {{trans|The House of Paper}}) is a Spanish television series created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]].

The Professor, skeptical of the announcement, casts dozens of clowns at the hospital and dresses up like one, blending in with the crowd while confirming the hoax.

Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown.

Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage.

Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise.

He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device.

In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]]. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with [[RPG-7]]s.

Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi.

With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion.

Gand\u00eda shoots a hole through the door and forces her head through it while he ties her hands to the door. In flashbacks, Nairobi asks the Professor to be the father of her child by [[in vitro fertilisation]] because she believes the Professor to have good genes. Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel. Gand\u00eda unties Nairobi and uses her to escape while the group holds him at gunpoint. As he escapes, he shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly\u2014Denver throws a grenade, which injures Gand\u00eda.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 30\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = Tumbar la carpa\n| AltTitle        = Strike the Tent\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra\n| WrittenBy       = Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya, Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = A wounded Gand\u00eda makes it back to the panic room. The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom. Tamayo calls Gand\u00eda's communications centre, but the telecommunication cords are cut by Bogot\u00e1 before he can answer. The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] takes over Lisbon's custody, and removes her from the tent.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = Plan Par\u00eds\n| AltTitle        = The Paris Plan\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Berlin confronts Palermo about his feelings towards him, while also revealing his own feelings for Palermo. They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gaurav.singhal7303", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

However, NEC's Electronic Device Sales Division developed the microprocessor evaluation kit [[TK-80]], which became unexpectedly popular among hobbyists. {{nihongo|Tomio Got\u014d|\u5f8c\u85e4 \u5bcc\u96c4}}, a developer of the TK-80, observed the rise in popularity of personal computers at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Computer manufacturers had not developed [[Personal computer|personal computers]] because they assumed microprocessors were not suitable for computing as they suffered from a lack of performance and reliability. The division decided to develop a personal computer despite criticism from the Information Processing Group, which developed mainframes, and claimed that they were making toys. The division only had a small distribution network of electronic parts stores, so they asked New Nippon Electric to sell the personal computers through their consumer distribution network.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nThe Electronic Device Sales Division launched the [[PC-8001]] in 1979, and it dominated 40% of the Japanese personal computer market in 1981.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5927\u56f3\u9451 \u6700\u65b0\u30fb\u4eba\u6c17\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u76ee\u7684\u5225\u5168\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year=1981|isbn=4-06-141673-1|pages=30\u201331|language=Japanese}}</ref> The vice president of NEC, {{Nihongo|Atsuyoshi \u014cuchi|\u5927\u5185 \u6df3\u7fa9}}, stated:\n:\"It is sure that we cannot deny contributions of Electronic Devices Group as a parent of the personal computer.

New Nippon Electric made 8-bit home computers ([[PC-6000 series]]), while Information Processing Group made 16-bit business personal computers and Electronic Devices Group made other personal computers such as the [[PC-8000 series|PC-8000]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8800]], and [[NEC PC-100|PC-100 series]].\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:NEC personal computers advert in 1982.jpg|thumb|150px|Advert of NEC personal computers in 1982.

The development team initially planned for the new personal computer to be a small version of the business computer line which originated from the 1973 {{nihongo|NEAC System 100|NEAC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0100}}. {{nihongo|Kazuya Watanabe|\u6e21\u908a \u548c\u4e5f}}, who directed the development of the PC-8001, stated that the personal computer must have [[Microsoft BASIC]], considered compatibility of peripheral devices with previous NEC PCs, and disclosed specifications of its expansion slot. In September 1981, Hamada requested [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]'s [[Kazuhiko Nishi]] to rewrite [[N88-BASIC]] to run on the [[Intel 8086]] processor, and Nishi replied, saying that he wanted to talk with [[Bill Gates]]. Three months later, Nishi rejected Hamada's request because Microsoft was busy with the development of [[GW-BASIC]], and they don't want to produce more variants of Microsoft BASIC. Nishi told him, \"Microsoft is rewriting a BASIC that has the same function with more structured internal code, and it will be sold as the definitive 16-bit version named GW-BASIC. We'll provide a BASIC sooner if you choose the Japanese adoption of GW BASIC.\". Hamada replied, \"As I said, we want a BASIC that is compatible with the previous ones\". They couldn't make an agreement.\n\nHamada couldn't decide which plan they should develop, a small business computer or a personal computer, because the possibilities of Watanabe's plan was uncertain. While they were visiting software companies to collect and research applications for the PC-8001 and PC-8801, Hamada and Watanabe discovered that the consumer market wanted a 16-bit machine compatible with both PCs. Hamada decided to adopt two plans for different markets. In April 1982, the small business personal computer became the {{nihongo|NEC System 20 model 15|NEC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e020/15}}, which used a proprietary 16-bit microprocessor. The machine was introduced as a new model of traditional business computers, so it was not notable.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000055/card365.html|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5275\u4e16\u8a18|last=\u5bcc\u7530|first=\u502b\u751f|publisher=\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|year=1995|access-date=2019-03-11|via=[[Aozora Bunko]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, the software development team started [[reverse engineering]] N88-BASIC and designing N88-BASIC(86). After the team finished in March 1982, they started development on the PC-9801 (named ''N-10 Project''). A PC-9801 prototype was completed at the end of July 1982. The code of N88-BASIC (86) was written completely from scratch, but Nishi pointed out that the [[bytecode]] matched Microsoft's. It was unclear if the copyright law could apply to the bytecode. Nishi suggested to Hamada that NEC must have purchased the same amount of Microsoft's product as it corresponded to the license fee, and N88-BASIC(86) must show copyright notification for both [[Microsoft]] and NEC. Hamada approved it. The team considered third-party developers to be very important for the market's expansion. They provided 50\u2013100 prototypes and technical information for independent companies without a fee.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nIn 1981, the Terminal Units Division of the Information Processing Group also launched the personal computer series {{Ill|N5200|ja|}}, which was branded as the \"personal terminal\". It used an [[Intel 8086]] processor and a [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controller. Its architecture was similar to that of the PC-98, but it mostly ran the proprietary operating system ''[[PTOS (operating system)|PTOS]]''.

NEC announced that the PC-98 would be discontinued in 2003. 18.3 million of PC-98s shipped by the end of shipments in March 2004.<ref name=\"ozawa_2004\" /> The last version of Windows to support PC-98 was Windows 2000.\n\nNEC kept much of its hardware and platform proprietary or under license, so while it had a virtual monopoly in the Japanese market, later IBM PC clones with DOS/V and Windows from companies such as [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and [[Panasonic]] that did not require such license fees (like Epson's 98 clones) flooded the market and displaced NEC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Hardware ==\nThe PC-98 is different from the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] in many ways; for instance, it uses its own 16-bit C-bus ([[:ja:C\u30d0\u30b9|C\u30d0\u30b9]]) instead of the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus; BIOS, [[Memory-mapped I/O|I/O port]] addressing, memory management, and graphics output are also different. However, localized MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, or Windows will still run on PC-9801s.\n\n=== Expansion bus ===\n[[File:PC-9801DX expansion slot.jpg|thumb|Expansion slot (C-bus)]]\nAll PC-98 desktop models use a 100-pin expansion slot. It has 16 data and 24 address lines. The bus frequency is fixed at 5, 8 or 10&nbsp;MHz. PC-H98 and PC-9821A Series use a proprietary 32-bit Local Bus slot and existing 16-bit slot. The 16-bit expansion bus was also called C-bus (Compatible Bus). The PC-9821Xf introduced in 1994 shipped with C-bus slots and PCI slots on the motherboard, replacing Local Bus.\n\n=== Memory ===\n[[File:Buffalo EMJ-4000 EMS RAM board.jpg|thumb|4 MB memory board for C-bus]]\nMany PC-9801 models could increase system memory by installing expansion boards, daughterboards, or proprietary SIMMs. They were limited to 14.6 MB, due to 24-bit address pins and reserve space. [[Expanded memory|EMS]] memory boards for C-bus were also available. The PC-9821Af introduced in 1993 shipped with standard 72-pin SIMMs, broke 14.6 MB barrier and supported memory up to 79.6 MB. Later desktop models shipped with standard SIMM or [[DIMM]] memory.\n\nThe PC-98XA (1985) and its successors, called ''high-resolution machine'' or simply ''hi-reso machine'', were capable of 768 KB [[Conventional memory|base memory]], but I/O port and memory addressing was quite different from normal PC-98.\n\n=== Storage ===\nEarly PC-9801 models supported 1232 KB 8-inch floppy drives and/or 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch floppy drives. Each used different [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]] lines and I/O ports. Later models supported both interfaces. 5\u00bc-inch and 3\u00bd-inch HD floppy disks used the same logical format and data rate with 1232 KB 8-inch floppy disks. They became a non-standard format while formats brought by IBM PC/AT and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] became the industry standard.\n\nThe PC-98 supports up to four floppy drives. If the system is booted from a floppy drive, MS-DOS [[Drive letter assignment|assigns letters]] to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive. If the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign the hard drive as drive \"A:\" and the floppy as drive \"B:\"; this would cause incompatibility among Windows PC applications, although it can be resolved with the SETUP command in Windows 95 by turning on the \"/AT\" switch to assign the Windows system drive to the standard \"C:\" drive.\n\nThe PC-98 used several different interfaces of hard drives. Early models used [[Shugart Associates System Interface]] (SASI) or [[ST506/ST412|ST506]], and later models used SCSI or IDE drives.\n\n=== Graphics ===\n[[File:N88-BASIC(86) color text with graphics.png|thumb|Drawing 8 color characters and 16 color background.]]\nA standard PC-98 has two [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controllers (a master and a slave) with 12 KB main memory and 256 KB of video RAM respectively. The master display controller handles font ROM, displaying [[JIS X 0201]] (7x13 pixels) and [[JIS X 0208]] (15x16 pixels) characters. Each character had a variety of display options, including bits for secret, blinking, reverse, underline and three intensity bits (grayscale or RGB). The other display controller is set to slave mode and connected to 256 KB of [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video memory, allowing it to display 640 x 400 pixel graphics with 16 colors out of a palette of 4096. The video RAM is divided into pages (2 pages x 4 planes x 32 KB in 640x400 16 colour mode), and the programmer can control which page is written to and which page is output.\n\nThe high-resolution machines (PC-98XA, XL, and PC-H98) offered 1120x750 display mode, and aimed for tasks such as CAD and word processing.\n\nThe PC-9801U (optional) and VM introduced a custom chipset GRCG (''GRaphic CharGer'') to access several [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar memory]] in parallel. The PC-9801VX introduced a [[blitter]] chip called EGC (''Enhanced Graphic Charger'').<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1986|title=\u65b0\u6a5f\u7a2e\u7dca\u6025\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8 : PC-9801VX|journal=[[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII]]|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|volume=10|issue=12|pages=130\u2013133|issn=0386-5428}}</ref> It had raster operations and bit shifting.\n\nIn 1993, NEC introduced a 2D Windows accelerator card for PC-98 called the ''Window Accelerator Board'' and employed [[S3 Graphics|S3]]'s 86C928.

responded quickly to the new demand for business personal computers.\n* NEC succeeded in attracting many third-party suppliers and dominated software production and distribution.\n* NEC adopted Microsoft's MS-DOS as an operating system for the PC-98.\n\nWestern computers lacked Japanese support due to its display resolution and speed, so they could not get into the Japanese PC market until the [[DOS/V]] and faster computers came out; for example, IBM Japan sold the [[IBM 5550]] instead of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Akihiko Hyodo, a programmer who developed the text editor [[VZ Editor]], said two advantage that the PC-98 had were its kanji character memory and non-[[Interlaced video|interlaced]] monitor. Both provided users with a more comfortable Japanese environment.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=17\u201321|language=Japanese|chapter=PC\u696d\u754c\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306ePC-9801}}</ref> A senior vice president of Otsuka Shokai (a computer distributor for enterprises) recalled that \"early users such as [[Kao Corporation|Kao]] already had office automation with the PC-8000, but it lacked speed and kanji support.

He said, \"Third-party suppliers of Japanese PCs had already grown up to a certain extent. However, it was not because they were organized. They were born by themselves, and hardware manufacturers didn't touch them. When we developed the PC-9800 series, we changed our method to make a conscious effort to grow them up\".<ref name=\"hamada_2004\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=4\u20139|language=Japanese|chapter=\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u8f9b\u9178\u3092\u5617\u3081\u601d\u8003\u3092180\u5ea6\u8ee2\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304cPC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3078\u3064\u306a\u304c\u3063\u305f}}</ref>\n\nIchiran Kou, a computer consultant, pointed out that IBM influenced NEC's strategy. Since 1982, NEC had four personal computer lines, and they covered a wide price range, similar to IBM's mainframe business. However, NEC's computers had poor backward compatibility and as such was criticized by users and software developers. After reforming personal computer lines in 1983, NEC began expanding the PC-9801 series and its number of models exceeded its competitors.<ref name=\"kou_1988\">{{Cite book|title=100\u4e07\u4eba\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f \u30b6\u30fbPC\u306e\u7cfb\u8b5c|last=\u5e83|first=\u4e00\u862d|publisher=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|year=1988|isbn=4-8061-0316-0|editor-last=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|pages=124\u2013127|chapter=IBM\u5927\u578b\u6a5f\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u898b\u3048\u308bNEC\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u6226\u7565|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nNEC encouraged third-party developers as IBM did for the IBM PC. The basic hardware of PC-98 was also similar to the IBM PC, though it was not IBM compatible. Kou guessed that NEC avoided releasing an IBM compatible PC because the company was proud of developing an original mainframe.<ref name=\"kou_1988\" />\n\nYasuhiro Uchida, a literature professor, wrote an essay titled \"Users chose the most ''playable'' PC\". He felt the PC-98 was an \"ordinary\" 16-bit personal computer, but it had plenty of games because it did not deny the ''playability''. He theorized that Fujitsu did not consider the 16-bit personal computer as a game platform, and considered [[IBM JX]] handling games to be of minor importance, which made personal computers less attractive. He concluded that the actual value of personal computers must be found by not sellers but consumers.<ref name=\"uchida_1988\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA writer of the [[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII magazine]] wrote that the [[Japanese input method]] and the Japanese [[video game industry]] were significantly developed in the PC-98 era. Because the PC-98 had a kanji character ROM, Japanese applications were developed for it, which influenced Japanese input methods being developed for them; the two built off of each other. Software companies that developed games for the PC-98 immediately expanded the video game business on the [[Famicom]] platform. He believed most programmers learned [[computer programming]] on the PC-98 at that time.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\" />\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the late 1980s, competitors criticized NEC [[Monopoly|monopolizing]] the market. Takayoshi Shina, a founder of [[Sord Computer Corporation|Sord]], said, \"The Japanese PC market is suffocating because of one company's dominance. There is no freedom. This is why its prices are 3-4 times as expensive as America's. To fulfil the same international price as America's, we really need the era of clone computers.\". A software company also complained that \"although there are few excellent engineers in Japan, the more incompatible machines appear, the more development resources are divided.\".<ref name=\"matsuo_1988\" />\n\nContrary to the IBM PC and the [[Apple II]], every Japanese personal computer had a short lifespan; NEC released a new model of the PC-98 every year. When the PC-9801VX01/21/41 models brought a new BASIC interpreter which supported the Enhanced Graphic Charger (EGC) chipset, most commercial software did not use it as they were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Many developers did not follow it because they wanted to make their software less dependent on the specific platform. A software developer said, \"Using the special one (EGC) goes against the trend. I don't want to use it if new machines come out so frequently.\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u5800\u5ddd|first=\u660e\u7f8e|publication-date=1987-08-10|title=\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u6700\u524d\u7dda\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u96fb\u6c17PC-9800VX01/21/41/41WN \u4e92\u63db\u6a5f\u5dfb\u304d\u8fd4\u3057\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067|journal=\u65e5\u7d4c\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3|publisher=[[Nikkei McGraw-Hill]]|pages=77\u201381|issn=0287-9506|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[PC game]]\n* [[PC-8800 Series]]\n* [[X68000]]\n* [[TurboGrafx-16]]\n* [[Commodore 64]]\n* [[FM-7]]\n* [[FM Towns]]\n* [[MSX]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Joel West and Jason Dedrick, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110544/http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/WEST_J/Papers/WestDedrick2000.pdf Innovation and Control in Standards Architectures: The Rise and Fall of Japan's PC-98]\", ''[[Information Systems Research]]'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2000, pp.&nbsp;197\u2013216\n* {{cite book |title=\u6539\u8a02\u7248 PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af HARDWARE\u7de8 |date=1993 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=4756104568 |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (Hardware, Revised Ed.)}}\n* {{cite book |title=PC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af BIOS\u7de8 |date=1992 |author=Ascii Techwrite |publisher=Ascii |isbn=475610441X |trans-title=PC-9800 Series Technical Databook (BIOS)}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first1=Steven |author-last1=Myers |author-first2=Greg |author-last2=Smith |title=DOS/V: The Soft(ware) Solution to Hard(ware) Problems |date=March 1995 |journal=Computing Japan Magazine |url=http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |access-date=2017-01-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115192029/http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/mar95/03dosv.html |archive-date=2017-01-15}}\n* {{cite journal |author-first=John |author-last=Boyd |title=From Chaos to Competition -

However, NEC's Electronic Device Sales Division developed the microprocessor evaluation kit [[TK-80]], which became unexpectedly popular among hobbyists. {{nihongo|Tomio Got\u014d|\u5f8c\u85e4 \u5bcc\u96c4}}, a developer of the TK-80, observed the rise in popularity of personal computers at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Computer manufacturers had not developed [[Personal computer|personal computers]] because they assumed microprocessors were not suitable for computing as they suffered from a lack of performance and reliability. The division decided to develop a personal computer despite criticism from the Information Processing Group, which developed mainframes, and claimed that they were making toys. The division only had a small distribution network of electronic parts stores, so they asked New Nippon Electric to sell the personal computers through their consumer distribution network.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\" />\n\nThe Electronic Device Sales Division launched the [[PC-8001]] in 1979, and it dominated 40% of the Japanese personal computer market in 1981.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5927\u56f3\u9451 \u6700\u65b0\u30fb\u4eba\u6c17\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u76ee\u7684\u5225\u5168\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year=1981|isbn=4-06-141673-1|pages=30\u201331|language=Japanese}}</ref> The vice president of NEC, {{Nihongo|Atsuyoshi \u014cuchi|\u5927\u5185 \u6df3\u7fa9}}, stated:\n:\"It is sure that we cannot deny contributions of Electronic Devices Group as a parent of the personal computer.

New Nippon Electric made 8-bit home computers ([[PC-6000 series]]), while Information Processing Group made 16-bit business personal computers and Electronic Devices Group made other personal computers such as the [[PC-8000 series|PC-8000]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8800]], and [[NEC PC-100|PC-100 series]].\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:NEC personal computers advert in 1982.jpg|thumb|150px|Advert of NEC personal computers in 1982.

The development team initially planned for the new personal computer to be a small version of the business computer line which originated from the 1973 {{nihongo|NEAC System 100|NEAC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0100}}. {{nihongo|Kazuya Watanabe|\u6e21\u908a \u548c\u4e5f}}, who directed the development of the PC-8001, stated that the personal computer must have [[Microsoft BASIC]], considered compatibility of peripheral devices with previous NEC PCs, and disclosed specifications of its expansion slot. In September 1981, Hamada requested [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]'s [[Kazuhiko Nishi]] to rewrite [[N88-BASIC]] to run on the [[Intel 8086]] processor, and Nishi replied, saying that he wanted to talk with [[Bill Gates]]. Three months later, Nishi rejected Hamada's request because Microsoft was busy with the development of [[GW-BASIC]], and they don't want to produce more variants of Microsoft BASIC. Nishi told him, \"Microsoft is rewriting a BASIC that has the same function with more structured internal code, and it will be sold as the definitive 16-bit version named GW-BASIC. We'll provide a BASIC sooner if you choose the Japanese adoption of GW BASIC.\". Hamada replied, \"As I said, we want a BASIC that is compatible with the previous ones\". They couldn't make an agreement.\n\nHamada couldn't decide which plan they should develop, a small business computer or a personal computer, because the possibilities of Watanabe's plan was uncertain. While they were visiting software companies to collect and research applications for the PC-8001 and PC-8801, Hamada and Watanabe discovered that the consumer market wanted a 16-bit machine compatible with both PCs. Hamada decided to adopt two plans for different markets. In April 1982, the small business personal computer became the {{nihongo|NEC System 20 model 15|NEC\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e020/15}}, which used a proprietary 16-bit microprocessor. The machine was introduced as a new model of traditional business computers, so it was not notable.<ref name=\"tomita_1995\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000055/card365.html|title=\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5275\u4e16\u8a18|last=\u5bcc\u7530|first=\u502b\u751f|publisher=\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|year=1995|access-date=2019-03-11|via=[[Aozora Bunko]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, the software development team started [[reverse engineering]] N88-BASIC and designing N88-BASIC(86). After the team finished in March 1982, they started development on the PC-9801 (named ''N-10 Project''). A PC-9801 prototype was completed at the end of July 1982. The code of N88-BASIC (86) was written completely from scratch, but Nishi pointed out that the [[bytecode]] matched Microsoft's. It was unclear if the copyright law could apply to the bytecode. Nishi suggested to Hamada that NEC must have purchased the same amount of Microsoft's product as it corresponded to the license fee, and N88-BASIC(86) must show copyright notification for both [[Microsoft]] and NEC. Hamada approved it. The team considered third-party developers to be very important for the market's expansion.

NEC announced that the PC-98 would be discontinued in 2003. 18.3 million of PC-98s shipped by the end of shipments in March 2004.<ref name=\"ozawa_2004\" /> The last version of Windows to support PC-98 was Windows 2000.\n\nNEC kept much of its hardware and platform proprietary or under license, so while it had a virtual monopoly in the Japanese market, later IBM PC clones with DOS/V and Windows from companies such as [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and [[Panasonic]] that did not require such license fees (like Epson's 98 clones) flooded the market and displaced NEC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Hardware ==\nThe PC-98 is different from the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] in many ways; for instance, it uses its own 16-bit C-bus ([[:ja:C\u30d0\u30b9|C\u30d0\u30b9]]) instead of the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus; BIOS, [[Memory-mapped I/O|I/O port]] addressing, memory management, and graphics output are also different. However, localized MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, or Windows will still run on PC-9801s.\n\n=== Expansion bus ===\n[[File:PC-9801DX expansion slot.jpg|thumb|Expansion slot (C-bus)]]\nAll PC-98 desktop models use a 100-pin expansion slot. It has 16 data and 24 address lines. The bus frequency is fixed at 5, 8 or 10&nbsp;MHz. PC-H98 and PC-9821A Series use a proprietary 32-bit Local Bus slot and existing 16-bit slot. The 16-bit expansion bus was also called C-bus (Compatible Bus). The PC-9821Xf introduced in 1994 shipped with C-bus slots and PCI slots on the motherboard, replacing Local Bus.\n\n=== Memory ===\n[[File:Buffalo EMJ-4000 EMS RAM board.jpg|thumb|4 MB memory board for C-bus]]\nMany PC-9801 models could increase system memory by installing expansion boards, daughterboards, or proprietary SIMMs. They were limited to 14.6 MB, due to 24-bit address pins and reserve space. [[Expanded memory|EMS]] memory boards for C-bus were also available. The PC-9821Af introduced in 1993 shipped with standard 72-pin SIMMs, broke 14.6 MB barrier and supported memory up to 79.6 MB. Later desktop models shipped with standard SIMM or [[DIMM]] memory.\n\nThe PC-98XA (1985) and its successors, called ''high-resolution machine'' or simply ''hi-reso machine'', were capable of 768 KB [[Conventional memory|base memory]], but I/O port and memory addressing was quite different from normal PC-98.\n\n=== Storage ===\nEarly PC-9801 models supported 1232 KB 8-inch floppy drives and/or 640 KB 5\u00bc-inch floppy drives. Each used different [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]] lines and I/O ports. Later models supported both interfaces. 5\u00bc-inch and 3\u00bd-inch HD floppy disks used the same logical format and data rate with 1232 KB 8-inch floppy disks. They became a non-standard format while formats brought by IBM PC/AT and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] became the industry standard.\n\nThe PC-98 supports up to four floppy drives. If the system is booted from a floppy drive, MS-DOS [[Drive letter assignment|assigns letters]] to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive. If the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign the hard drive as drive \"A:\" and the floppy as drive \"B:\"; this would cause incompatibility among Windows PC applications, although it can be resolved with the SETUP command in Windows 95 by turning on the \"/AT\" switch to assign the Windows system drive to the standard \"C:\" drive.\n\nThe PC-98 used several different interfaces of hard drives. Early models used [[Shugart Associates System Interface]] (SASI) or [[ST506/ST412|ST506]], and later models used SCSI or IDE drives.\n\n=== Graphics ===\n[[File:N88-BASIC(86) color text with graphics.png|thumb|Drawing 8 color characters and 16 color background.]]\nA standard PC-98 has two [[NEC \u00b5PD7220|\u00b5PD7220]] display controllers (a master and a slave) with 12 KB main memory and 256 KB of video RAM respectively. The master display controller handles font ROM, displaying [[JIS X 0201]] (7x13 pixels) and [[JIS X 0208]] (15x16 pixels) characters. Each character had a variety of display options, including bits for secret, blinking, reverse, underline and three intensity bits (grayscale or RGB). The other display controller is set to slave mode and connected to 256 KB of [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video memory, allowing it to display 640 x 400 pixel graphics with 16 colors out of a palette of 4096. The video RAM is divided into pages (2 pages x 4 planes x 32 KB in 640x400 16 colour mode), and the programmer can control which page is written to and which page is output.\n\nThe high-resolution machines (PC-98XA, XL, and PC-H98) offered 1120x750 display mode, and aimed for tasks such as CAD and word processing.\n\nThe PC-9801U (optional) and VM introduced a custom chipset GRCG (''GRaphic CharGer'') to access several [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar memory]] in parallel. The PC-9801VX introduced a [[blitter]] chip called EGC (''Enhanced Graphic Charger'').<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1986|title=\u65b0\u6a5f\u7a2e\u7dca\u6025\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8 : PC-9801VX|journal=[[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII]]|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|volume=10|issue=12|pages=130\u2013133|issn=0386-5428}}</ref> It had raster operations and bit shifting.\n\nIn 1993, NEC introduced a 2D Windows accelerator card for PC-98 called the ''Window Accelerator Board'' and employed [[S3 Graphics|S3]]'s 86C928.

responded quickly to the new demand for business personal computers.\n* NEC succeeded in attracting many third-party suppliers and dominated software production and distribution.\n* NEC adopted Microsoft's MS-DOS as an operating system for the PC-98.\n\nWestern computers lacked Japanese support due to its display resolution and speed, so they could not get into the Japanese PC market until the [[DOS/V]] and faster computers came out; for example, IBM Japan sold the [[IBM 5550]] instead of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Akihiko Hyodo, a programmer who developed the text editor [[VZ Editor]], said two advantage that the PC-98 had were its kanji character memory and non-[[Interlaced video|interlaced]] monitor. Both provided users with a more comfortable Japanese environment.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=17\u201321|language=Japanese|chapter=PC\u696d\u754c\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306ePC-9801}}</ref> A senior vice president of Otsuka Shokai (a computer distributor for enterprises) recalled that \"early users such as [[Kao Corporation|Kao]] already had office automation with the PC-8000, but it lacked speed and kanji support.

He said, \"Third-party suppliers of Japanese PCs had already grown up to a certain extent. However, it was not because they were organized. They were born by themselves, and hardware manufacturers didn't touch them. When we developed the PC-9800 series, we changed our method to make a conscious effort to grow them up\".<ref name=\"hamada_2004\">{{Cite book|title=\u8607\u308bPC-9801\u4f1d\u8aac \u6c38\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u7248 \u7b2c1\u5f3e|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|year=2004|isbn=4-7561-4419-5|pages=4\u20139|language=Japanese|chapter=\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u8f9b\u9178\u3092\u5617\u3081\u601d\u8003\u3092180\u5ea6\u8ee2\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304cPC-9800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3078\u3064\u306a\u304c\u3063\u305f}}</ref>\n\nIchiran Kou, a computer consultant, pointed out that IBM influenced NEC's strategy. Since 1982, NEC had four personal computer lines, and they covered a wide price range, similar to IBM's mainframe business. However, NEC's computers had poor backward compatibility and as such was criticized by users and software developers. After reforming personal computer lines in 1983, NEC began expanding the PC-9801 series and its number of models exceeded its competitors.<ref name=\"kou_1988\">{{Cite book|title=100\u4e07\u4eba\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f \u30b6\u30fbPC\u306e\u7cfb\u8b5c|last=\u5e83|first=\u4e00\u862d|publisher=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|year=1988|isbn=4-8061-0316-0|editor-last=\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u793e|pages=124\u2013127|chapter=IBM\u5927\u578b\u6a5f\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u898b\u3048\u308bNEC\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u6226\u7565|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nNEC encouraged third-party developers as IBM did for the IBM PC. The basic hardware of PC-98 was also similar to the IBM PC, though it was not IBM compatible. Kou guessed that NEC avoided releasing an IBM compatible PC because the company was proud of developing an original mainframe.<ref name=\"kou_1988\" />\n\nYasuhiro Uchida, a literature professor, wrote an essay titled \"Users chose the most ''playable'' PC\". He felt the PC-98 was an \"ordinary\" 16-bit personal computer, but it had plenty of games because it did not deny the ''playability''. He theorized that Fujitsu did not consider the 16-bit personal computer as a game platform, and considered [[IBM JX]] handling games to be of minor importance, which made personal computers less attractive. He concluded that the actual value of personal computers must be found by not sellers but consumers.<ref name=\"uchida_1988\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA writer of the [[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII magazine]] wrote that the [[Japanese input method]] and the Japanese [[video game industry]] were significantly developed in the PC-98 era. Because the PC-98 had a kanji character ROM, Japanese applications were developed for it, which influenced Japanese input methods being developed for them; the two built off of each other. Software companies that developed games for the PC-98 immediately expanded the video game business on the [[Famicom]] platform. He believed most programmers learned [[computer programming]] on the PC-98 at that time.<ref name=\"ascii_2004_memory\" />\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the late 1980s, competitors criticized NEC [[Monopoly|monopolizing]] the market. Takayoshi Shina, a founder of [[Sord Computer Corporation|Sord]], said, \"The Japanese PC market is suffocating because of one company's dominance. There is no freedom. This is why its prices are 3-4 times as expensive as America's. To fulfil the same international price as America's, we really need the era of clone computers.\". A software company also complained that \"although there are few excellent engineers in Japan, the more incompatible machines appear, the more development resources are divided.\".<ref name=\"matsuo_1988\" />\n\nContrary to the IBM PC and the [[Apple II]], every Japanese personal computer had a short lifespan; NEC released a new model of the PC-98 every year. When the PC-9801VX01/21/41 models brought a new BASIC interpreter which supported the Enhanced Graphic Charger (EGC) chipset, most commercial software did not use it as they were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Many developers did not follow it because they wanted to make their software less dependent on the specific platform. A software developer said, \"Using the special one (EGC) goes against the trend.
