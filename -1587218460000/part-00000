Between 1978 and 2005, China's [[per capita GDP]] grew from $153 to $1,284. Its [[current account surplus]] increased more than twelve-fold between 1982 and 2004, from $5.7 billion to $71 billion. During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] to the increasingly sophisticated production of [[computers]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[automobiles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how long the Chinese economy can maintain this trajectory. According to the 11th [[five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plan]], China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of [[central planning]] and winning them to the cause of reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the [[Bank|banking sector]] and launching the beginnings of a real [[capital market]]. According to an article in ''Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy'' by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China.<ref>Jalil, Abdul and Feridun, Mete (2011) Long-run relationship between income inequality and financial development in China.

As of 2004, China's [[state-owned enterprise]]s were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in [[non-performing loan]]s, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a [[floating exchange rate]], and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing.

Some government revenues also came from taxes, of which the most important was the general industrial and commercial tax.\n\nThe trend, however, has been for remitted profits of the state enterprises to be replaced with taxes on those profits. Initially, this tax system was adjusted so as to allow for differences in the [[market capitalization]] and pricing situations of various firms, but more-uniform tax schedules were introduced in the early 1990s.

On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.\n\nThe [[rate of exchange]] (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's [[balance of trade]], inflation, measured by the [[consumer price index]] and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's [[central bank]] has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.<ref>Keith Bradsher )29 December 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html \"China Lets Currency Appreciate a Bit Faster\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html |date=8 February 2017 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.<ref name=\"Jalil, Abdul 2010 pp. 189-195\"/>\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.<ref name=\"NYT81315\">{{cite news |author1=Neil Gough |title=China Seeks to Calm Markets as It Devalues Currency for 3rd Consecutive Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/international/china-devalues-its-currency-renminbi-for-a-third-consecutive-day.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |quote=...policy makers say they will give market forces greater sway over currency's value.

Nevertheless, about 60 percent of the population lives in the rural areas, and until the 1980s a high percentage of them made their living directly from farming. Since then, many have been encouraged to leave the fields and pursue other activities, such as [[light manufacturing]], commerce, and transportation; and by the mid-1980s farming accounted for less than half of the value of rural output. Today, agriculture contributes only 13% of China's GDP.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the [[livestock]] output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of [[aquaculture]].

[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html Nuclear Power in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212223045/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html |date=12 February 2013 }} (November 2007)</ref> Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in [[coal]] and [[oil]], the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense [[hydroelectric potential]]. But the industrialized regions around [[Guangzhou]] and the [[Yangtze River|Lower Yangtze]] region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little [[heavy industry]] located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current [[energy mix]] from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70\u201375% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, [[natural gas]], [[Renewable energy in China|renewable energy]], and [[Nuclear power in China|nuclear power]]. China has closed thousands of [[coal mines]] over the past five to ten years to cut [[overproduction]]. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed [[Crude oil|crude]] in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (560,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from [[Central Asia]] and has invested in [[Kazakhstan]]i [[oil field]]s.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

London: Routledge, pp. 115\u2013133.</ref> Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|10th Five-Year Plan]] (2001\u20132005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\nThe [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]] (2006\u201310), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of [[clean coal technology]]. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n====Mining====\n{{see also|Gold mining in China}}\nOutdated [[mining]] and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques, but China's [[industrialization of China|rapid industrialization]] requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from [[mining in Australia|Australia]] and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as [[steel production in China|steel production]] rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. Also China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]].\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were [[coal mining in China|coal]] (nearly 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tons), [[iron ore]] (310&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[petroleum industry in China|crude petroleum]] (175&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[natural gas]] (41&nbsp;million cubic meters), [[antimony]] ore (110,000&nbsp;tons), [[tin]] concentrates (110,000 tons), [[nickel]] ore (64,000&nbsp;tons), [[tungsten]] concentrates (67,000&nbsp;tons), unrefined [[salt]] (37&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[vanadium]] (40,000&nbsp;tons), and [[molybdenum]] ore (29,000&nbsp;tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were [[bauxite]], [[gypsum]], [[barite]], [[magnesite]], [[talc]] and related minerals, [[manganese]] ore, [[fluorspar]], and [[zinc]]. In addition, China produced 2,450&nbsp;tons of [[silver]] and 215&nbsp;tons of [[gold]] in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n====Hydroelectric resources====\n[[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Three Gorges Dam]]\nChina has an abundant potential for [[hydroelectric power]] production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the [[Southwest China|southwest of the country]], where coal supplies are poor but [[energy demand|demand for energy]] is rising swiftly.

However, its proportion of GDP is still low compared to the ratio in more developed countries, and the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural sector]] still employs a larger workforce.\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated [[Retailing|shops]], [[rationing]], and regulated prices\u2014with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade has expanded quickly, with numerous [[shopping mall]]s, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas.

Being a [[Second World]] country at the time{{When|date=December 2019}}, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the [[Third World]] was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. The principal efforts were made in Asia, especially to [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, and [[Sri Lanka]], but large loans were also granted in Africa ([[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], [[Tanzania]]) and in the Middle East ([[Egypt]]). However, after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) group, which promotes [[free trade]] and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nAfter reaching a bilateral WTO agreement with the EU and other trading partners in summer 2000, China worked on a multilateral WTO accession package. China concluded multilateral negotiations on its accession to the WTO in September 2001. The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest [[port]]s in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233&nbsp;billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%.

During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13&nbsp;billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05&nbsp;billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368&nbsp;million during January\u2013September 2005, twice that in 2004.\n\n[[File:E7210-NN-kitaj-auto.jpg|thumb|Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry]]\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the [[Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]], adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n==Foreign investment==\n{{see also|Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China|Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor|Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor|China Investment Promotion Agency|China Council for the Promotion of International Trade|Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China}}\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms.

In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for [[Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise]]s and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state, such as energy, communications and transportation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in [[Shanghai]] and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of [[stock]] in selected companies listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange|Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]] Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45&nbsp;billion in [[foreign direct investment]].

In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totalled about $145&nbsp;billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment after the United States. China received $39&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 1999 and $41&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 2000.

Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.<ref>{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Salmon |date=29 October 2004 |title = Shanghai Automotive expands with Korea purchase |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-ssang_ed3_.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Choe |first = Sang-Hun |date = 24 February 2009 |title = In Carmaker's Collapse, a Microcosm of South Korea's Woes |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |page = A6 |access-date = 18 February 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723022736/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date = 23 July 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint vendure called TCL-Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book ''Resumption of Trading'' by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n* According to Scott Markman, president of Monogram, Chinese companies often moved their business model to developed countries and it doesn't work. Thomson has the problem, they are very good and distribution and operation in China but France and Europe is a totally different world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known value of US$969 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |title=Statistics on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) \u2013 M&A Courses &#124; Company Valuation Courses &#124; Mergers & Acquisitions Courses |publisher=Imaa-institute.org |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106045040/http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |archive-date=6 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The number and value of deals hit a new record in 2010.

Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The [[population growth]] rate surged as the [[mortality rate]] dropped more rapidly than the [[birth rate]]. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major [[birth control]] program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958\u201360 was partially responsible for a huge [[Great Chinese Famine|famine]] that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second [[population control]] drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of [[contraceptive]]s. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second [[family planning]] program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the [[one-child policy|one child per family policy]] was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1&nbsp;billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3&nbsp;billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.<ref>[[List of countries by population growth rate]]</ref> China's [[population growth rate]] is now among the lowest for a [[developing country]], although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly [[Population ageing|ageing]] countries in the world.\n\nFrom 100&nbsp;million to 150&nbsp;million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time, low-paying jobs.\n\nAccording to the latest [[Forbes China Rich List]] (2007), China had 66 [[billionaire]]s, the second largest number after the [[Forbes 400|United States]], which had 415.

This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the Communist Party of China, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.<ref name=\"CNBC011913\">{{cite news |title=Chinese Labor Pool Begins to Drain |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |publisher=CNBC |date=19 January 2013 |author=Jamil Anderliniin |author2=Ed Crooks |agency=Financial Times |accessdate=8 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328064737/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |archive-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation and infrastructure==\n{{main|Transport in China}}\n\n[[File:A maglev train coming out, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Shanghai Maglev Train]]]]\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]: [http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926172608/http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet [[military transport]] and [[Military logistics|logistics]] needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of [[ocean shipping]] was broadened considerably.\n\n[[Freight]] [[Logistics|haulage]] is mainly provided by [[rail transport]]. The rail sector is monopolized by [[China Railway]] and there is wide variation in services provided.

This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.<ref>{{cite news |first1 = Vincent |last1 = Bazi |first2 = M.

Between 1978 and 2005, China's [[per capita GDP]] grew from $153 to $1,284. Its [[current account surplus]] increased more than twelve-fold between 1982 and 2004, from $5.7 billion to $71 billion. During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] to the increasingly sophisticated production of [[computers]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[automobiles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how long the Chinese economy can maintain this trajectory. According to the 11th [[five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plan]], China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of [[central planning]] and winning them to the cause of reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the [[Bank|banking sector]] and launching the beginnings of a real [[capital market]]. According to an article in ''Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy'' by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China.<ref>Jalil, Abdul and Feridun, Mete (2011) Long-run relationship between income inequality and financial development in China.

As of 2004, China's [[state-owned enterprise]]s were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in [[non-performing loan]]s, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a [[floating exchange rate]], and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing.

Some government revenues also came from taxes, of which the most important was the general industrial and commercial tax.\n\nThe trend, however, has been for remitted profits of the state enterprises to be replaced with taxes on those profits. Initially, this tax system was adjusted so as to allow for differences in the [[market capitalization]] and pricing situations of various firms, but more-uniform tax schedules were introduced in the early 1990s.

On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.\n\nThe [[rate of exchange]] (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's [[balance of trade]], inflation, measured by the [[consumer price index]] and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's [[central bank]] has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.<ref>Keith Bradsher )29 December 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html \"China Lets Currency Appreciate a Bit Faster\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html |date=8 February 2017 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.<ref name=\"Jalil, Abdul 2010 pp. 189-195\"/>\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.<ref name=\"NYT81315\">{{cite news |author1=Neil Gough |title=China Seeks to Calm Markets as It Devalues Currency for 3rd Consecutive Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/international/china-devalues-its-currency-renminbi-for-a-third-consecutive-day.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |quote=...policy makers say they will give market forces greater sway over currency's value.

Nevertheless, about 60 percent of the population lives in the rural areas, and until the 1980s a high percentage of them made their living directly from farming. Since then, many have been encouraged to leave the fields and pursue other activities, such as [[light manufacturing]], commerce, and transportation; and by the mid-1980s farming accounted for less than half of the value of rural output. Today, agriculture contributes only 13% of China's GDP.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the [[livestock]] output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of [[aquaculture]].

[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html Nuclear Power in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212223045/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html |date=12 February 2013 }} (November 2007)</ref> Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in [[coal]] and [[oil]], the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense [[hydroelectric potential]]. But the industrialized regions around [[Guangzhou]] and the [[Yangtze River|Lower Yangtze]] region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little [[heavy industry]] located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current [[energy mix]] from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70\u201375% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, [[natural gas]], [[Renewable energy in China|renewable energy]], and [[Nuclear power in China|nuclear power]]. China has closed thousands of [[coal mines]] over the past five to ten years to cut [[overproduction]]. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed [[Crude oil|crude]] in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (560,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from [[Central Asia]] and has invested in [[Kazakhstan]]i [[oil field]]s.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

London: Routledge, pp. 115\u2013133.</ref> Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|10th Five-Year Plan]] (2001\u20132005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\nThe [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]] (2006\u201310), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of [[clean coal technology]]. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n====Mining====\n{{see also|Gold mining in China}}\nOutdated [[mining]] and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques, but China's [[industrialization of China|rapid industrialization]] requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from [[mining in Australia|Australia]] and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as [[steel production in China|steel production]] rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. Also China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]].\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were [[coal mining in China|coal]] (nearly 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tons), [[iron ore]] (310&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[petroleum industry in China|crude petroleum]] (175&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[natural gas]] (41&nbsp;million cubic meters), [[antimony]] ore (110,000&nbsp;tons), [[tin]] concentrates (110,000 tons), [[nickel]] ore (64,000&nbsp;tons), [[tungsten]] concentrates (67,000&nbsp;tons), unrefined [[salt]] (37&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[vanadium]] (40,000&nbsp;tons), and [[molybdenum]] ore (29,000&nbsp;tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were [[bauxite]], [[gypsum]], [[barite]], [[magnesite]], [[talc]] and related minerals, [[manganese]] ore, [[fluorspar]], and [[zinc]]. In addition, China produced 2,450&nbsp;tons of [[silver]] and 215&nbsp;tons of [[gold]] in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n====Hydroelectric resources====\n[[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Three Gorges Dam]]\nChina has an abundant potential for [[hydroelectric power]] production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the [[Southwest China|southwest of the country]], where coal supplies are poor but [[energy demand|demand for energy]] is rising swiftly.

However, its proportion of GDP is still low compared to the ratio in more developed countries, and the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural sector]] still employs a larger workforce.\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated [[Retailing|shops]], [[rationing]], and regulated prices\u2014with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade has expanded quickly, with numerous [[shopping mall]]s, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas.

Being a [[Second World]] country at the time{{When|date=December 2019}}, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the [[Third World]] was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. The principal efforts were made in Asia, especially to [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, and [[Sri Lanka]], but large loans were also granted in Africa ([[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], [[Tanzania]]) and in the Middle East ([[Egypt]]). However, after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) group, which promotes [[free trade]] and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nAfter reaching a bilateral WTO agreement with the EU and other trading partners in summer 2000, China worked on a multilateral WTO accession package. China concluded multilateral negotiations on its accession to the WTO in September 2001. The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest [[port]]s in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233&nbsp;billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%.

During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13&nbsp;billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05&nbsp;billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368&nbsp;million during January\u2013September 2005, twice that in 2004.\n\n[[File:E7210-NN-kitaj-auto.jpg|thumb|Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry]]\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the [[Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]], adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n==Foreign investment==\n{{see also|Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China|Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor|Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor|China Investment Promotion Agency|China Council for the Promotion of International Trade|Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China}}\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms.

In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for [[Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise]]s and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state, such as energy, communications and transportation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in [[Shanghai]] and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of [[stock]] in selected companies listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange|Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]] Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45&nbsp;billion in [[foreign direct investment]].

In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totalled about $145&nbsp;billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment after the United States. China received $39&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 1999 and $41&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 2000.

Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.<ref>{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Salmon |date=29 October 2004 |title = Shanghai Automotive expands with Korea purchase |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-ssang_ed3_.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Choe |first = Sang-Hun |date = 24 February 2009 |title = In Carmaker's Collapse, a Microcosm of South Korea's Woes |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |page = A6 |access-date = 18 February 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723022736/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date = 23 July 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint vendure called TCL-Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book ''Resumption of Trading'' by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n* According to Scott Markman, president of Monogram, Chinese companies often moved their business model to developed countries and it doesn't work. Thomson has the problem, they are very good and distribution and operation in China but France and Europe is a totally different world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known value of US$969 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |title=Statistics on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) \u2013 M&A Courses &#124; Company Valuation Courses &#124; Mergers & Acquisitions Courses |publisher=Imaa-institute.org |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106045040/http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |archive-date=6 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The number and value of deals hit a new record in 2010.

Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The [[population growth]] rate surged as the [[mortality rate]] dropped more rapidly than the [[birth rate]]. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major [[birth control]] program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958\u201360 was partially responsible for a huge [[Great Chinese Famine|famine]] that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second [[population control]] drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of [[contraceptive]]s. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second [[family planning]] program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the [[one-child policy|one child per family policy]] was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1&nbsp;billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3&nbsp;billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.<ref>[[List of countries by population growth rate]]</ref> China's [[population growth rate]] is now among the lowest for a [[developing country]], although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly [[Population ageing|ageing]] countries in the world.\n\nFrom 100&nbsp;million to 150&nbsp;million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time, low-paying jobs.\n\nAccording to the latest [[Forbes China Rich List]] (2007), China had 66 [[billionaire]]s, the second largest number after the [[Forbes 400|United States]], which had 415.

This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the Communist Party of China, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.<ref name=\"CNBC011913\">{{cite news |title=Chinese Labor Pool Begins to Drain |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |publisher=CNBC |date=19 January 2013 |author=Jamil Anderliniin |author2=Ed Crooks |agency=Financial Times |accessdate=8 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328064737/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |archive-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation and infrastructure==\n{{main|Transport in China}}\n\n[[File:A maglev train coming out, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Shanghai Maglev Train]]]]\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]: [http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926172608/http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet [[military transport]] and [[Military logistics|logistics]] needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of [[ocean shipping]] was broadened considerably.\n\n[[Freight]] [[Logistics|haulage]] is mainly provided by [[rail transport]]. The rail sector is monopolized by [[China Railway]] and there is wide variation in services provided.

This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.<ref>{{cite news |first1 = Vincent |last1 = Bazi |first2 = M.

Rushing towards them, he discovers a man being disemboweled by a polar bear. He tries to shoot the bear to save the man but accidentally shot the man in the head instead. Immediately after, Sheriff Dan Anderssen arrives and tells Tyson he will take responsibility for the mercy killing.

She tells Eric that due to a [[compound fracture]], Myklebust had recently retrained to shoot left handed, yet the gunshot residue stained glove recovered from the scene of her death was from her right hand. She then tells him she believes Dan set up the scene and stole Myklebust\u2019s body from the mortuary, questioning his sanity. The two later raid Dan\u2019s residence, finding Myklebust\u2019s body, a badly injured Vincent and a depraved [[shrine]] of corpses in the bathroom. Elsa\u2019s body begins to deteriorate due to [[scorbutic]] [[liquefaction]], but she believes that undergoing a transfusion with the infected Natalie may definitively save her. However, Michael instead drives her to the airport, informs Ingrid of Natalie\u2019s location, and tells Elsa he plans to take her to a hospice in [[Bergen]] where she can die in peace instead of killing more people. Dan breaks into Elsa\u2019s cabin and rescues Natalie, whose eyesight has been restored. However the parasite is still active in her, and she bludgeons him with a hammer and cuts him open. The police arrive at the cabin to find Natalie vomiting the larvae into Dan\u2019s body, but are able to prevent her from being shot by Petra. In the ambulance, a dying Dan hallucinates first Hildur, and then Billy Pettigrew handcuffing him to a pylon as he did at the start of the series. He then hallucinates Henry Tyson, who tells him that [[shamanism|shaman folklore]] states you must be guided into the next life by someone who loves you, but there is no such person for Dan due to the atrocities he has committed. On a plane headed for the mainland with Michael, an unresponsive Elsa\u2019s eyes begin to bleed. \n |LineColor =#000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nCritics gave positive reviews.
