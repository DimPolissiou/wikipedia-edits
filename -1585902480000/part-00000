The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel ([[seismic velocity]]) is different in other layers.  The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to [[Snell's law]], like light bending as it passes through a prism.

Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]], built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called [[enstatite]] chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\n\n[[Dynamo theory]] suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the [[Coriolis effect]], gives rise to [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see [[Curie temperature]]) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core.

The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel ([[seismic velocity]]) is different in other layers.  The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to [[Snell's law]], like light bending as it passes through a prism.

The thicker crust is [[continental crust]], which is less dense and composed of ([[felsic]]) [[sodium]] potassium [[aluminium]] silicate rocks, like [[granite]]. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories \u2013 sial and sima (Suess, 1831\u20131914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11&nbsp;km below the [[Conrad discontinuity]] (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the [[lithosphere]]. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the [[seismic wave|seismic]] velocity, which is most commonly known as the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]] or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing [[feldspar|plagioclase feldspar]] (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a [[chemistry|chemical]] discontinuity between [[ultramafic]] cumulates and tectonized [[Peridotite|harzburgites]], which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been [[obduction|obducted]] onto the continental crust and preserved as [[ophiolites|ophiolite sequences]].\n\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1{{e|8}}) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion (4.4{{e|9}}) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.<ref>[http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0101/14earthwater/ Breaking News | Oldest rock shows Earth was a hospitable young planet].

Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]], built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called [[enstatite]] chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\n\n[[Dynamo theory]] suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the [[Coriolis effect]], gives rise to [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see [[Curie temperature]]) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5&nbsp;mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.<ref>[http://www.science20.com/news_articles/first_measurement_magnetic_field_inside_earths_core First Measurement Of Magnetic Field Inside Earth's Core].

The company is developing new business on wood based biofuels for transport. The brand name for the future biofuels of UPM is UPM BioVerno. The production concepts are based on non-food raw materials and they result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The UPM Biofuels surpass both the EU and Finnish requirements for sustainable biofuels. One of the goals in the long run is to expand the production of biofuels with new processes and raw-materials like pyrolysis oil and solid biomass.<ref name=\"UPM Annual Report 2013\">UPM Annual Report 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Pages/default.aspx|title=Title|accessdate=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729033349/http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2015-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Biorefinery===\nUPM has invested in a [[biorefinery]] producing biofuels from crude tall oil in [[Lappeenranta]], [[Finland]]. The biorefinery produces annually approximately 100,000 tonnes of advanced second generation biodiesel for transport. Construction of the biorefinery began in the summer of 2012 at UPM\u2019s Kaukas mill site and was completed in 2014. UPM\u2019s total investment amounted to approximately EUR 150 million. The construction of the biorefinery offered work for nearly 200 people for approximately two years.  The biorefinery directly employs nearly 50 people and indirectly about 150 people.<ref>UPM stock exchange release 1 February 2012, http://www.upm.com/EN/MEDIA/All-news/Pages/UPM-to-build-the-world\u2019s-first-biorefinery-producing-wood-based-biodiesel-001-Wed-01-Feb-2012-10-05.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417214543/http://www.upm.com/EN/MEDIA/All-news/Pages/UPM-to-build-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-biorefinery-producing-wood-based-biodiesel-001-Wed-01-Feb-2012-10-05.aspx |date=2014-04-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Biodiesel===\nUPM is planning to produce [[biodiesel]] from forest energy wood. The raw material to be used in the production of UPM's biodiesel would mainly consist of sustainably sourced wood: logging residues, woodchips, stumps and bark. UPM has been developing gasification technology for biodiesel production with Andritz/Carbona. The initial testing programme was completed in the United States as planned. UPM's biodiesel is well suited for the current diesel motor technology and fuel distribution infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Biodiesel/Pages/default.aspx|title=UPM Biofuels|accessdate=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705010111/http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Biodiesel/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2015-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bio oil===\nBio oil will substitute heavy and light fuel oils in heating applications. The future applications of bio oil could be electricity production and transportation fuels. Pilot testing started in 2009 in [[Metso]]'s Research and Development Centre in Finland. The end product has already been tested in one of the [[Fortum]]'s district heating boiler plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Bio-oil/Pages/default.aspx|title=UPM Biofuels|accessdate=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217115430/http://www.upm.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Biofuels/Bio-oil/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Research and development ==\n===UPM Grada===\nUPM Plywood has developed a new way to manufacture layered composites and the new form of [[plywood]] is called UPM Grada. At the core of the new technology is a special adhesive film, which allows the plywood to be formed after manufacturing. UPM Grada Plywood can be safely [[Recycling|recycled]] or burned at the end of its lifecycle. UPM Grada Plywood can be used e.g. in furniture. The Finnish furniture manufacturer Isku has introduced the new Kaava chair which demonstrates the capabilities of UPM Grada Plywood.<ref>UPM general brochure, p. 13</ref>\n\n===UPM ProFi===\nUPM ProFi [[Composite material|composite]] is a Biofore material that combines the best characteristics of [[Cellulose fiber|cellulose fibres]] and [[plastic]]. Manufactured mainly from recycled raw material, the composite has proven to be tough and humidity resistant. The material is suitable for use in [[patio]]s, [[Terrace (building)|terraces]], [[pier]]s and [[playground]]s. The material does not require polishing, lacquer finishing or other surface finishing. The material was a result of UPM's own research and product development.\nUPM ProFi has been used in the manufacture of a pedestrian walkway in the historic city of [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].<ref>UPM General brochure, p. 14</ref>\n\n===UPM Formi===\nUPM Formi is a recyclable and odorless composite which can be used to replace plastic in many instances.
