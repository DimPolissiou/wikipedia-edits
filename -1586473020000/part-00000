He and his older sister and younger brother were raised by their grandmother. Silva supported the family from the age of 6 by selling newspapers, shining shoes, and doing odd jobs. He never attended school as a student, but learned to read and write by watching his sister and brother do their homework. Silva was able to study a correspondence course on radio repair through an agreement with the town barber, under which the barber rented the lessons to Silva, and Silva earned the diploma in the barber's name.{{Citation needed|date = December 2010}}\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Silva began to repair radios and built a successful business which he maintained for the next 40 years, interrupted only by military service.{{Citation needed|date = December 2010}}\n\n==World War II service==\nDuring [[World War II]], Silva joined the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  At his induction, he was examined by an Army psychiatrist. Intrigued by the psychiatrist's odd questions, Silva inquired about a book on hypnosis that was sitting on the psychiatrist's bookshelf. As a result, Silva began to study psychology and, in particular, the nature of hypnotic suggestion and perception in altered states. While in the Signal Corps, Silva studied advanced electronics and became an instructor. \n\nWhen Silva was discharged, he resumed his radio repair business. The newly established Laredo Junior College asked him to create an electronics training program for the school. Five years later, with the spread of television, his repair business began to flourish and Silva ended his teaching career.{{Citation needed|date = December 2010}}\n\n==Career in parapsychology==\nDuring the 1940s, Silva developed a set of techniques with which he aimed to be able to alter his children's IQs and develop their [[psychic]] abilities (e.g. [[clairvoyance]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The skeptic's dictionary|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|publisher=Wiley|year=2003|isbn=0471480886|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|chapter=Silva Method|oclc=55751218|chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/silva.html}}</ref> His 'mind experiments' were based on his background in electronics and reading of psychology. He had read about [[alpha wave]]s and the electrical activity in the human brain and bought an electroencephalograph (EEG). He found that one area of the brain, the part that produces alpha brain wave activity, was stronger than the others. This indicated to him that the [[electrical impedance]] of this area of the brain was lower, and therefore would function more  efficiently.\n\nSince this part of the brain operated more efficiently, Silva believed that it could receive and store more information. The crucial problem for Silva was to keep the mind alert at these frequencies, which are associated more with daydreaming and sleep than with practical activity.\n\nSilva experimented with [[hypnosis]], but while hypnosis made the mind more receptive, he felt that more individual control was necessary for improving brain function.  He experimented next with mental training exercises to quiet the brain yet keep it more independently alert than in hypnosis. This, he reasoned, would lead to improved [[memory]] combined with understanding and hence to higher [[I.Q.]] scores.\n\nThe exercises from which Silva's techniques evolved called for relaxed concentration and vivid mental visualization and ways of reaching lower levels. He believed that these levels proved more effective in learning than the fully awake, or [[beta wave]], level.

Silva reported that his daughter began to give the answers to the questions he was forming in his mind before he verbalized them.\n\nIn this period, ESP was becoming a subject of scientific inquiry, largely through the published work of Dr. [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] of [[Duke University]].  Silva wrote to Rhine to report that he had trained his daughter to practice [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]].  In his response, Rhine pointed out that Silva's daughter may have been [[psychic]] before the training, and that he had not pretested her.  Silva then worked to reproduce his results, and over the next ten years he trained thirty-nine Laredo residents, both children and adults, and continued to refine his process.

The film, which has no dialogue, stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]] and [[Tinnu Anand]]. It revolves around an unemployed graduate who encounters a drunk millionaire unconscious by the roadside and takes over his lifestyle after keeping him prisoner. However, he does not realise the dangers he has brought upon himself because a hired [[Contract killing|hitman]] believes him to be his target.\n\nRao's desire to make a dialogue-less film came when he was working as an assistant director in a film where a character had to emote fear without dialogue in a scene. Once the idea for ''Pushpaka Vimana'' materialised, Rao wrote the screenplay within two weeks. The film was the only one produced by Nagaraj. Due to the lack of dialogue, Rao was able to cast actors from different parts of [[India]]. Cinematography was handled by [[B. C. Gowrishankar]], and the background score by [[L. Vaidyanathan]]. The film was shot in [[Bangalore]].\n\n''Pushpaka Vimana'' was released on 27 November 1987 with different titles for different regions such as '''''Pesum Padam''''' ({{trans|Talking Picture}}) in Tamil and '''''Pushpak''''' ({{trans|Flower}}) in Hindi. The film received critical acclaim and became a commercial success; it film had a 35-week theatrical run in Bangalore. It later won the [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment]] and in three categories at the [[35th Filmfare Awards South]]: [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Director\u00a0\u2013 Kannada]] (Rao) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Kannada]] (Haasan).\n\n== Plot ==\nAn unemployed graduate living in a ramshackle lodge called Anand Bhavan dreams of riches. While in a shop, he meets a girl trying on earrings, and sees her again when he appears for a vacany. One day, he finds a drunk millionaire unconscious by the roadside. On finding the key to a suite in a plush five-star hotel named \"Pushpak\" in his pocket, the graduate carries the millionaire to his room at Anand Bhavan and keeps him prisoner there with the help of forced doses of alcohol. He then moves to the millionaire's suite at Pushpak to take over his lifestyle.\n\nThe millionaire's wife has a secret lover, who hires a hitman to kill the millionaire without her knowledge. The hitman, who has never seen the millionaire, believes the graduate is his target. The graduate learns that the girl is at the same hotel, and is the daughter of a magician. The graduate follows around the girl before she slaps him because of a misunderstanding where he appeared to her as being unmannered. But after the hotel owner suddenly dies, the two meet while paying tribute at his funeral and mend ways. They gradually get into a romantic relationship.\n\nAll the while, the hitman tries to kill the graduate with ice daggers, but fails on every attempt. The graduate remains unaware about the threat to his life. Eventually he realises that the hitman is in the hotel to kill someone, but is unable to find the identity of his target. Later the hitman intrudes into his suite and gets electrocuted while trying to stab the graduate from behind, but survives. Followed by the graduate, the hitman returns to the lover's bungalow and informs him about his failure. The graduate learns the complete truth. The two conspirators also realise that they were targeting the wrong man all the time. At this time, the millionaire's wife learns of her lover's treachery and breaks up with him.\n\nIn a montage shown about the hotel owner, the graduate realises that he was a poor man, just like him. Seeing what the hotel owner achieved by fair means, the graduate begins to question his actions. Some time later, a roadside beggar dies and municipality people come to take his dead body. However, seeing the beggar's stash, they abandon his body on the pavement and start taking the money. The graduate decides to make things right. He sets the millionaire free and explains the situation to him in a letter. The millionaire and his wife reunite and he stops drinking. After that, the graduate decides to come clean to the magician's daughter as well. He learns that the magician and his family are about to leave Pushpak.\n\nThe graduate confesses the truth to the magician's daughter, but to his surprise she forgives him. While leaving Pushpak, she writes something on a paper and drops a rose wrapped in the same paper from her car for the graduate to take. The graduate obtains the rose, but before he can obtain the paper, a gust of wind rolls it into a gutter. Some time later, the graduate is shown standing in a long queue of job seekers.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- arranged per Pushpak intro credits -->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as the unemployed graduate\n* [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]] as the magician's daughter\n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as the hitman\n* [[Sameer Khakhar]] as the millionaire\n* K.

The film, which has no dialogue, stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]] and [[Tinnu Anand]]. It revolves around an unemployed graduate who encounters a drunk millionaire unconscious by the roadside and takes over his lifestyle after keeping him prisoner. However, he does not realise the dangers he has brought upon himself because a hired [[Contract killing|hitman]] believes him to be his target.\n\nRao's desire to make a dialogue-less film came when he was working as an assistant director in a film where a character had to emote fear without dialogue in a scene. Once the idea for ''Pushpaka Vimana'' materialised, Rao wrote the screenplay within two weeks. The film was the only one produced by Nagaraj. Due to the lack of dialogue, Rao was able to cast actors from different parts of India. Cinematography was handled by [[B. C. Gowrishankar]], and the background score by [[L. Vaidyanathan]]. The film was shot in [[Bangalore]].\n\n''Pushpaka Vimana'' was released on 27 November 1987 with different titles for different regions such as '''''Pesum Padam''''' ({{trans|Talking Picture}}) in Tamil and '''''Pushpak''''' ({{trans|Flower}}) in Hindi. The film received critical acclaim and became a commercial success; it film had a 35-week theatrical run in Bangalore. It later won the [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment]] and in three categories at the [[35th Filmfare Awards South]]: [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Director\u00a0\u2013 Kannada]] (Rao) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Kannada|Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Kannada]] (Haasan).\n\n== Plot ==\nAn unemployed graduate living in a ramshackle lodge called Anand Bhavan dreams of riches. While in a shop, he meets a girl trying on earrings, and sees her again when he appears for a vacany. One day, he finds a drunk millionaire unconscious by the roadside. On finding the key to a suite in a plush five-star hotel named \"Pushpak\" in his pocket, the graduate carries the millionaire to his room at Anand Bhavan and keeps him prisoner there with the help of forced doses of alcohol. He then moves to the millionaire's suite at Pushpak to take over his lifestyle.\n\nThe millionaire's wife has a secret lover, who hires a hitman to kill the millionaire without her knowledge. The hitman, who has never seen the millionaire, believes the graduate is his target. The graduate learns that the girl is at the same hotel, and is the daughter of a magician. The graduate follows around the girl before she slaps him because of a misunderstanding where he appeared to her as being unmannered. But after the hotel owner suddenly dies, the two meet while paying tribute at his funeral and mend ways. They gradually get into a romantic relationship.\n\nAll the while, the hitman tries to kill the graduate with ice daggers, but fails on every attempt. The graduate remains unaware about the threat to his life. Eventually he realises that the hitman is in the hotel to kill someone, but is unable to find the identity of his target. Later the hitman intrudes into his suite and gets electrocuted while trying to stab the graduate from behind, but survives. Followed by the graduate, the hitman returns to the lover's bungalow and informs him about his failure. The graduate learns the complete truth. The two conspirators also realise that they were targeting the wrong man all the time. At this time, the millionaire's wife learns of her lover's treachery and breaks up with him.\n\nIn a montage shown about the hotel owner, the graduate realises that he was a poor man, just like him. Seeing what the hotel owner achieved by fair means, the graduate begins to question his actions. Some time later, a roadside beggar dies and municipality people come to take his dead body. However, seeing the beggar's stash, they abandon his body on the pavement and start taking the money. The graduate decides to make things right. He sets the millionaire free and explains the situation to him in a letter. The millionaire and his wife reunite and he stops drinking. After that, the graduate decides to come clean to the magician's daughter as well. He learns that the magician and his family are about to leave Pushpak.\n\nThe graduate confesses the truth to the magician's daughter, but to his surprise she forgives him. While leaving Pushpak, she writes something on a paper and drops a rose wrapped in the same paper from her car for the graduate to take. The graduate obtains the rose, but before he can obtain the paper, a gust of wind rolls it into a gutter. Some time later, the graduate is shown standing in a long queue of job seekers.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- arranged per Pushpak intro credits -->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as the unemployed graduate\n* [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]] as the magician's daughter\n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as the hitman\n* [[Sameer Khakhar]] as the millionaire\n* K.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] in a [[rolling meth lab]], Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \u2019[[Heisenberg]]\u2019 to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) through his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]], the local gangs, the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Breaking Bad'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], who spent several years writing the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the [[protagonist]] became the [[antagonist]]. \"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades,\" he said. \"When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?\"<ref name=\"grantland\" /> He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]].<ref name=\"THR\" /><ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /><ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" /> Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and acting.<ref name=\"esquire history\"/>\n\nThe show title is a [[Southern United States|Southern]] colloquialism meaning, among other things, \"raising hell\", and was chosen by Gilligan to describe Walter's transformation.<ref name=\"AutoHY-2\" /> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' entertainment editor Lily Rothman, the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which \"connotes more violence than 'raising hell' does&nbsp;... [T]he words possess a wide variety of nuances: to 'break bad' can mean to 'go wild', to 'defy authority', and break the law, to be verbally 'combative, belligerent, or threatening' or, followed by the preposition 'on', 'to dominate or humiliate'.\"<ref name=\"Rothman\" />\n\nThe concept emerged as Gilligan talked with his fellow ''X-Files'' writer [[Thomas Schnauz]] regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a \"[[Rolling meth lab|meth lab in the back of an RV]] and [drive] around the country cooking meth and making money\".<ref name=\"tease\" />\n\nAfter writing the concept for the show and pilot, Gilligan pitched it to [[Sony Pictures Television]], who became very interested in supporting it. Sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on this, as they had already started broadcasting ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', a show with similarities to the premise of ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/> While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, Gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about ''Weeds'' earlier.<ref name=\"huffington-weeds\" /> Other networks like [[HBO]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] also passed on the idea, but eventually [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot.<ref name=\"thr history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-bryan-cranston-347082 |title=Bleak, Brutal, Brilliant 'Breaking Bad': Inside the Smash Hit That Almost Never Got Made |first1=Lacey |last1=Rose |first2=Stacey Wilson |last2=Hunt |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> At the same time, FX had also started development of ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'', a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up ''Breaking Bad'' for ''Dirt''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\nOne of Gilligan's agents spoke to Jeremy Elice, the director of original programming for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming ''[[Mad Men]]''. Elice was intrigued, and soon a meeting was set up between Gilligan, Elice, and two programming executives. Gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting, fearing they would just put him off, but instead all three showed great interest, and the meeting ended up establishing how AMC would acquire the rights from FX and set the pilot into production. It took about a year following this meeting before Sony had set up the rights with AMC and production could start.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\n=== Development history ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 400\n| perrow    = 2\n| footer = ''Breaking Bad'' was filmed at various locations across Albuquerque.

Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean \"we'd always have to be avoiding the [[Sandia Mountains]]\" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location.<ref name=\"AutoHY-3\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-4\" /> It was shot primarily on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-5\" /> with [[Digital cinematography|digital cameras]] employed as needed for additional angles, [[point of view shot]]s and [[time-lapse photography]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-6\" />  ''Breaking Bad'' cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.<ref name=\"AutoHY-7\" />\n\nAround 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for ''Breaking Bad''. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> At the same time, [[Netflix]] was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service, and arranged a deal with Sony for ''Breaking Bad'' to be available after the airing of the fourth season. However, knowing that AMC had placed ''Breaking Bad'' on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Because of this, ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix \"kept us on the air\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\" />\n\nAs the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walter increasingly unsympathetic.<ref name=\"THR\" /> Gilligan said during the run of the series, \"He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why.\"<ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /> Cranston said by the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]], \"I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass.\"<ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" />\n\nIn July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude ''Breaking Bad'' at the end of its fifth season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\" /> In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]], the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\" /> On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" />\n\nBefore the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he \"didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.<ref name=tease /> Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end ''Breaking Bad'' with Walter's death, occurring in-story two years after he had been first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live. Gilligan said by the end of the series, \"it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience\" from the first episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/video-vince-gilligan-breaking-bads-639466 |title=Vince Gilligan on 'Breaking Bad's' 'The Searchers' Parallels: 'We Stole From the Best' |first=Sophie |last=Schillaci |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Quote box |width=30em|align=right|quote=\"You're going to see that underlying humanity, even when he's making the most devious, terrible decisions, and you need someone who has that humanity&nbsp;\u2013 deep down, bedrock humanity&nbsp;\u2013 so you say, watching this show, 'All right, I'll go for this ride.

Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0306\" /> AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character [[Hal (Malcolm in the Middle)|Hal]] on the comedy series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', approached actors [[John Cusack]] and [[Matthew Broderick]] about the role.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\" /> When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his ''X-Files'' episode.<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" />\n\nCranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the Walter White persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own [[backstory]] for the character.<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline, and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\" /> Cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled,<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\" /> and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders.\" In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" />\n\n[[Aaron Paul]]'s casting was also initially questioned by production, as Paul looked too old and too much like a \"pretty boy\" to be associated with meth cooking. However, Gilligan reconsidered Paul's skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[Lord of the Flies (The X-Files)|Lord of the Flies]]\".<ref name=\"thr history\"/> Gilligan originally intended for Pinkman to be killed at the end of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|first season]] in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that \"it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse\".<ref name=\"Paley Centre\" /> Similarly, [[Dean Norris]] had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[F. Emasculata]]\", and was brought on to be Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and DEA agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/how-x-files-gave-birth-784003 |title=How 'X-Files' Gave Birth to 'Breaking Bad' |first=Aaron |last=Couch |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific accuracy ===\n[[Donna Nelson]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]], checked scripts and provided dialogue. She also drew [[chemical structure]]s and wrote [[chemical equation]]s which were used as props. According to creator Vince Gilligan,\n\n<blockquote>Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, \"I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand.\" She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, [[electrical engineering]], or [[physics]]. We try to get everything correct.

According to Gilligan, Nelson \"vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-15\" /> Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right, saying that Gilligan \"said it made a difference to him.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-16\" />\n\nSeveral episodes of ''[[Mythbusters]]'' featured attempts to validate or disprove scenes from ''Breaking Bad'', often with Gilligan guest-starring in the episode to participate. In 2013, two scenes from the first season of ''Breaking Bad'' were put under scrutiny in a [[MythBusters (2013 season)#Episode 206&nbsp;\u2013 \"Breaking Bad Special\"|''Mythbusters Breaking Bad'' special]].

On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as [[phenylacetone]] or P2P) is produced from [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] using a [[tube furnace]] and [[thorium dioxide]] (ThO<sub>2</sub>) as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]], as mentioned in episodes \"A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\" and \"M\u00e1s\".

As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the name of \"Heisenberg\". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he <blockquote>... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.<ref name=\"AutoHY-18\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as [[Skyler White]]&nbsp;\u2013 Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.

Norris, who has played several policemen before in film and television, stated: <blockquote>Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot.

Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer [[Robert Evans]]. <blockquote>I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to ''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.<ref name=\"AutoHY-24\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as [[Gus Fring|Gustavo \"Gus\" Fring]] (recurring season 2, main cast season 3\u20134)&nbsp;\u2013 a Chilean high-level drug distributor who has a cover as an owner of the [[fast-food]] chain Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his [[yoga]] training in his performance. <blockquote>Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about [[Edward James Olmos|Eddie Olmos]] way back in ''[[Miami Vice]]''. He was like dead&nbsp;\u2013 he was hardly breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing?

The character of Mike has been compared to [[Harvey Keitel]]'s Winston Wolf character in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: \"I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly.

Jesse secures a [[recreational vehicle]] to cook in, while Walter devises a production route using unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel, Walter adopts the name \"Heisenberg\", with his \"blue sky\" meth his signature product.

Walter returns to Jesse to apologize, but allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. With Jesse in rehab, Walter seems content until he witnesses a midair collision of two planes, a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while on the job.\n\n=== Season 3 (2010) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nOn April 2, 2009, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a third, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-43\" /> It premiered on March 21, 2010, and concluded on June 13, 2010.

Walt produces meth for Declan, and Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful Walt makes {{USD|80 million}}, which he buries on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]]. Hank attempts to prove Walt is Heisenberg. Walt kills Mike and hires Jack's gang to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walt, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walt's money. Walt uses the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.\n\nWalt intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. He leaves his money in a trust Elliott and Gretchen will administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he dealt drugs because he liked it. At Jack's compound, Walt kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses and departs. Walt reminisces in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.\n\n== Themes and symbols ==\n\n=== Moral consequences ===\nIn an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', creator [[Vince Gilligan]] said the larger lesson of the series is that \"actions have consequences\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> He elaborated on the show's philosophy:\n\n{{quote|text=If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of [[Idi Amin]] living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for Biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that [[karma]] kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that's become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'}}\n\nIn a piece comparing the show to ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'', [[Chuck Klosterman]] said that ''Breaking Bad'' is \"built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live\". Klosterman added that the central question of ''Breaking Bad'' is: \"What makes a man 'bad'&nbsp;\u2013 his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?\" Klosterman concluded that, in the world of ''Breaking Bad'', \"goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else\".<ref name=\"grantland\" />\n\n[[Ross Douthat]] of ''The New York Times'', in a response to Klosterman's piece, compared ''Breaking Bad'' and ''The Sopranos'', stating that both series are \"[[morality play]]s\" that are \"both interested in [[moral agency]]\". Douthat went on to say that [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Tony Soprano]] \"represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation, and free will\". Walter is a man who \"deliberately abandons the light for the darkness\" while Tony is \"someone born and raised in darkness\" who turns down \"opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\" />\n\n=== Devotion to family ===\nThe show explores most of the main characters' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]] he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\" /> In the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|final episode of the series]], however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the $9.72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, Walt refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying, \"Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-29\" /> Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season.\n\nEven the show's more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]], Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that \"''La familia es todo''\" (\"Family is everything\"). Gustavo Fring's franchise ''Los Pollos Hermanos'' translates to \"The Chicken Brothers\". This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the first part of the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]], it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says \"don't skimp on family\", and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think Lydia abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, Lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia's daughter is important to how \"Lydia justified what she did to herself\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/30/breaking-bad-television |title=Breaking Bad's Lydia: 'Drinking camomile tea with milk is disgusting' |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Heritage |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Pink teddy bear ===\n[[File:Pink Teddy Bear from 'Breaking Bad'.jpg|thumb|The pink teddy bear as seen during the second season]]\nA [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] within the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]] is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the [[music video]] \"Fallacies\" for Jesse's band \"Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr\", which was released as a [[webisode]] in February 2009 leading to the second season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\" /> The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence \"[[Boeing 737|Seven Thirty-Seven]] down over [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|ABQ]]\".<ref name=\"nj\" /><ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"time\" /> The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'', in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.<ref name=\"Gilligan Answers Fan Questions\" /> At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes;<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-32\" /> the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize \"all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones\" and \"the judgment of God\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\" />\n\nIn the [[No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad)|first episode of the third season]], Walt finds the teddy bear's missing eye in the pool skimmer. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it \"a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for\",<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\" /> and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that \"the pink teddy bear continues to accuse\".<ref name=\"avc\" /> Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of [[Gus Fring]]'s face in the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\" />\n\nThe teddy bear prop was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|the show finale]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\" /><ref name=\"people\" />\n\n=== Walt Whitman ===\nWalter White's name is reminiscent of the poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"lat\"/> During the series, [[Gale Boetticher]] gives Walt a copy of Whitman's ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-37\" /> Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher recites \"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\" /> In the episode \"[[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|Bullet Points]]\", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher's notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt indicates that they must refer to Whitman.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hazard Pay]]\", Walt finds the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an especially high point in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, \"Song of Myself\", is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\" /> The mid-season finale of season five, \"[[Gliding Over All]]\", is titled after poem 271 of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\" /> In the episode, Hank finds ''Leaves of Grass'' in Walt's bathroom and opens it to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: \"To my <u>other</u> favorite W.W. It's an honour<!-- NOTICE TO EDITORS: THE NOTE SPELLS \"FAVORITE\" AND \"HONOUR\", SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SPELLING IN SPITE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY --> working with you. Fondly G.B.\" Upon reading this, Hank becomes visibly shocked, realizing the truth about Walter for the first time, which provides the opening premise for the second half of the final season.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ {{color|green|Metacritic}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-1}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-2}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-3}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-4}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-5}}</ref> and {{color|orange|Rotten Tomatoes}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s01 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s02 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s03 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s04 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s05 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> scores per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart |width=400 |height=200 |xAxisTitle=Season |yAxisTitle=Score |xType=string|type=line |showSymbols=true |colors=green,orange |x=1,2,3,4,5 |y1=73,84,89,96,99 |y2=83,100,100,100,100 |y1Title=Metacritic |y2Title=Rotten Tomatoes}}\n|}\n\n''Breaking Bad'' received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=\"greatest\" /> On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 73 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS1/> the second 84 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS2/> the third 89 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS3/> the fourth 96 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS4/> and the fifth 99 out of 100.<ref name=MetacriticS5/> The [[American Film Institute]] listed ''Breaking Bad'' as one of the top ten television series of 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"AutoHY-49\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-50\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-53\" /> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the ninth greatest TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |work=TV Guide |first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |first2=Matt |last2=Roush |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> By its end, the series was among the most-watched [[cable television|cable shows]] on American television, with audience numbers doubling from the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] to the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-54\" />  A 2015 ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named ''Breaking Bad'' as their #2 favorite show.<ref name=\"thr20150916\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-tv-shows-ever-top-819499/item/friends-hollywoods-100-favorite-tv-821361 |title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-07-17 |language=en}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it third on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/breaking-bad-w439638 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the first season, the series saw a generally positive reception. ''[[New York Post]]'' critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating \"Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say the two have created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-55\" /> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming \"There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-56\" />\n\nThe second season saw critical acclaim. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Ken Tucker]] stated \"''Bad'' is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again\u2014to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-57\" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for ''Breaking Bad'', now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-58\" /> Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-59\" />\n[[File:Aaron Paul, Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: [[Josh Sapan]] (AMC president and CEO), [[Aaron Paul]] ([[Jesse Pinkman]]), [[Vince Gilligan]] (creator), [[Bryan Cranston]] ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]) and Charlie Collier (President, general manager)]]\n\nThe third season also saw critical acclaim. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' proclaimed, \"It's a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it's all the hotter for that choice.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\" /> ''[[Newsday]]'' stated ''Breaking Bad'' was still TV's best series and it stayed true to itself.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\" /> Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the \"visual adventurousness\" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show's visuals \"a combination of staggering beauty&nbsp;\u2013 the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits&nbsp;\u2013 and transfixing weirdness.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\" /> After the finale aired, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that season three was \"one of television's finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting&nbsp;\u2013 what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing&nbsp;\u2013 is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, 'television good.' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-63\" />\n\nSeason four won near-universal critical acclaim. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' referred to the show as a \"taut exercise in withheld disaster\" and declared the show \"riveting\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-64\" /> The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' labeled the series \"smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\" /> Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\" /> ''Time'' listed Walter White's \"I am the one who knocks\" line as one of the best television lines of 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\" /> ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that \"''Breaking Bad'' is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-68\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'s}} review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on ''Breaking Bad''.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television&nbsp;\u2013 truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\" />\n\nBoth halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim. Following the end of the series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: \"Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, ''Breaking Bad'' is everything you could want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-70\" /> During the final season, the show also received praise from [[George R. R. Martin]], author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, particularly the episode \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\"; Martin commented that \"Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in [[Westeros]].\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-71\" /> In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of [[IGN]] stated, \"This final batch of ''Breaking Bad'' is one of the best run of episodes TV has ever offered,\" and praised \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\" in particular, referring to it as \"maybe the best episode of TV [he's] ever seen\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-72\" /> Jonah Goldberg of ''[[National Review]]'' called it \"the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-73\" /> The veteran actor [[Order of the British Empire|Sir]] [[Anthony Hopkins]] wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his \"performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen&nbsp;\u2013 ever\".

Along with creator Vince Gilligan, fellow writers and producers [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Thomas Schnauz]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]], [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], [[Sam Catlin]] and [[George Mastras]] joined to discuss memories from the show's humble beginnings, character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way. For instance, the character of [[Jesse Pinkman]] was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong. The reasoning behind this decision was that Jesse served his purpose \"in a meat-and-potatoes, logistical sense. The character would give Walt his entr\u00e9e into the business\" before meeting his demise. However, this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond Gilligan's early scripts.<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\nThe writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of [[storytelling]] evolved with the show. According to writer George Mastras,\n\n<blockquote>\"Screen time was precious, and infusing every moment with the emotion [was the point], not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story, which is hard enough. If you're going to take five seconds of screen time, you'd better damn well be sure that there's an emotion there. It may be very, very subtle, but trust the audiences to pick up on that, because audiences do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe development of certain characters posed challenges. [[Skyler White]] became unsympathetic to most viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to Walt's ultimate agenda. The writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that \"the only way people were going to like Skyler was if she started going along with what Walt was doing.\" It was a tricky shift to alter on screen because they didn't want to betray her character so they justified the change by using her past job as a [[bookkeeper]] to segue into her helping Walt [[money launder]] his cash under the guise of a car wash. Breaking the individual episodes was another form of problem solving for the writers. They stressed the importance of not letting the \"master plan\" stop them from staying true to the world they created. There came a point where tracking the characters on a moment-by-moment basis proved to be more useful rather than general direction of the story. Peter Gould said they would always start with the last thought in a character's head. \"Where's Jesse's head at? That was always the prelude to the breakthrough moment, because when you said that, it's usually because we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set-piece that we thought had to be there, but the characters didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\n=== Rian Johnson's experience on the show ===\n\nDirector [[Rian Johnson]] worked on three episodes (\"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", \"[[Fifty-One]]\" and \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\") and in an interview with [[IGN]] shared his memories from behind the camera. He shed some light on the process including the fact that he sat through \"tone meetings\" with Vince Gilligan. The two of them talked about every dramatic beat in a script, the distinct visual look of the show and how the tonal shift of each scene had to feel natural while serving the main storyline of the particular episode. Johnson also revealed that he learned so much about working with actors because of his directing of [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Aaron Paul]], describing the experience as a \"free masterclass.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/20/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-director-rian-johnson-looks-back-at-the-shows-legacy |title=Breaking Bad 10th Anniversary: Director Rian Johnson Looks Back at the Show's Legacy |publisher=IGN |first=Laura |last=Prudom |date=January 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the show's lasting legacy, Johnson offered up his thoughts,\n<blockquote>\"I think the seriousness and depth with which it took its characters is the thing that really makes it stand apart for me. And that's where the power of it comes from. Obviously, starting with [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], there's just very few stories that are told on that scale, that have a character who is that deeply considered at the center of it. And I've heard people describe it as [[Shakespearean]], and I know that word gets tossed around a lot, but I think in this case it really does apply. And that speaks, not so much to the fact that he goes to a dark place, but the fact that his entire journey is so deeply resonant, because it's so deeply considered.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Spin-offs and adaptations ==\n=== ''Met\u00e1stasis'' ===\nOn March 13, 2013, after several days of speculation fueled by [[Univision]],<ref name=\"remake\" /> [[Sony]] confirmed that it would be making a Spanish-language remake of ''Breaking Bad'' titled ''[[Met\u00e1stasis]]'' starring [[Diego Trujillo]] as Walter Blanco (Walter White) and Roberto Urbina as Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rosas (Jesse Pinkman), alongside Sandra Reyes and [[Juli\u00e1n Arango]] in unnamed roles.<ref name=\"remakeconfirm\" /> On October 2, 2013, the cast list was revealed to include Reyes as Cielo Blanco (Skyler White) and Arango as Henry Navarro (Hank Schrader), and that the show would be set in Colombia.<ref name=\"metacast\" /> The equivalent of [[Saul Goodman]] is named Sa\u00fal Bueno.<ref name=\"ns\" />\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul}}\nIn April 2013, it was revealed that AMC and Sony were interested in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series that would focus on Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), with Gilligan and series writer [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] developing the project.<ref name=\"AutoHY-79\" /> In September 2013, AMC and Sony Pictures Television officially ordered ''Better Call Saul'', set as a prequel to ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-80\" /> The series focuses on Saul's life 6 years before he became Walter's lawyer,<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\" /> and premiered on February 8, 2015.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\" /> ''Better Call Saul'' is currently airing its fifth season, with a sixth and final season to premiere in 2021.\n\n=== ''Talking Bad'' ===\nFrom August 11, 2013, to September 29, 2013, eight episodes of the live talk show, ''[[Talking Bad]]'', aired on AMC, following ''Breaking Bad''.

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] in a [[rolling meth lab]], Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \"[[Heisenberg]]\" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) through his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]], the local gangs, the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Breaking Bad'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], who spent several years writing the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the [[protagonist]] became the [[antagonist]]. \"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades,\" he said. \"When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?\"<ref name=\"grantland\" /> He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]].<ref name=\"THR\" /><ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /><ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" /> Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and acting.<ref name=\"esquire history\"/>\n\nThe show title is a [[Southern United States|Southern]] colloquialism meaning, among other things, \"raising hell\", and was chosen by Gilligan to describe Walter's transformation.<ref name=\"AutoHY-2\" /> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' entertainment editor Lily Rothman, the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which \"connotes more violence than 'raising hell' does&nbsp;... [T]he words possess a wide variety of nuances: to 'break bad' can mean to 'go wild', to 'defy authority', and break the law, to be verbally 'combative, belligerent, or threatening' or, followed by the preposition 'on', 'to dominate or humiliate'.\"<ref name=\"Rothman\" />\n\nThe concept emerged as Gilligan talked with his fellow ''X-Files'' writer [[Thomas Schnauz]] regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a \"[[Rolling meth lab|meth lab in the back of an RV]] and [drive] around the country cooking meth and making money\".<ref name=\"tease\" />\n\nAfter writing the concept for the show and pilot, Gilligan pitched it to [[Sony Pictures Television]], who became very interested in supporting it. Sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on this, as they had already started broadcasting ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', a show with similarities to the premise of ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/> While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, Gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about ''Weeds'' earlier.<ref name=\"huffington-weeds\" /> Other networks like [[HBO]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] also passed on the idea, but eventually [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot.<ref name=\"thr history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-bryan-cranston-347082 |title=Bleak, Brutal, Brilliant 'Breaking Bad': Inside the Smash Hit That Almost Never Got Made |first1=Lacey |last1=Rose |first2=Stacey Wilson |last2=Hunt |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> At the same time, FX had also started development of ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'', a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up ''Breaking Bad'' for ''Dirt''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\nOne of Gilligan's agents spoke to Jeremy Elice, the director of original programming for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming ''[[Mad Men]]''. Elice was intrigued, and soon a meeting was set up between Gilligan, Elice, and two programming executives. Gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting, fearing they would just put him off, but instead all three showed great interest, and the meeting ended up establishing how AMC would acquire the rights from FX and set the pilot into production. It took about a year following this meeting before Sony had set up the rights with AMC and production could start.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\n=== Development history ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 400\n| perrow    = 2\n| footer = ''Breaking Bad'' was filmed at various locations across Albuquerque.

Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean \"we'd always have to be avoiding the [[Sandia Mountains]]\" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location.<ref name=\"AutoHY-3\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-4\" /> It was shot primarily on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-5\" /> with [[Digital cinematography|digital cameras]] employed as needed for additional angles, [[point of view shot]]s and [[time-lapse photography]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-6\" />  ''Breaking Bad'' cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.<ref name=\"AutoHY-7\" />\n\nAround 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for ''Breaking Bad''. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> At the same time, [[Netflix]] was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service, and arranged a deal with Sony for ''Breaking Bad'' to be available after the airing of the fourth season. However, knowing that AMC had placed ''Breaking Bad'' on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Because of this, ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix \"kept us on the air\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\" />\n\nAs the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walter increasingly unsympathetic.<ref name=\"THR\" /> Gilligan said during the run of the series, \"He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why.\"<ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /> Cranston said by the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]], \"I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass.\"<ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" />\n\nIn July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude ''Breaking Bad'' at the end of its fifth season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\" /> In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]], the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\" /> On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" />\n\nBefore the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he \"didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.<ref name=tease /> Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end ''Breaking Bad'' with Walter's death, occurring in-story two years after he had been first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live. Gilligan said by the end of the series, \"it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience\" from the first episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/video-vince-gilligan-breaking-bads-639466 |title=Vince Gilligan on 'Breaking Bad's' 'The Searchers' Parallels: 'We Stole From the Best' |first=Sophie |last=Schillaci |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Quote box |width=30em|align=right|quote=\"You're going to see that underlying humanity, even when he's making the most devious, terrible decisions, and you need someone who has that humanity&nbsp;\u2013 deep down, bedrock humanity&nbsp;\u2013 so you say, watching this show, 'All right, I'll go for this ride.

Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0306\" /> AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character [[Hal (Malcolm in the Middle)|Hal]] on the comedy series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', approached actors [[John Cusack]] and [[Matthew Broderick]] about the role.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\" /> When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his ''X-Files'' episode.<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" />\n\nCranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the Walter White persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own [[backstory]] for the character.<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline, and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\" /> Cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled,<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\" /> and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders.\" In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" />\n\n[[Aaron Paul]]'s casting was also initially questioned by production, as Paul looked too old and too much like a \"pretty boy\" to be associated with meth cooking. However, Gilligan reconsidered Paul's skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[Lord of the Flies (The X-Files)|Lord of the Flies]]\".<ref name=\"thr history\"/> Gilligan originally intended for Pinkman to be killed at the end of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|first season]] in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that \"it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse\".<ref name=\"Paley Centre\" /> Similarly, [[Dean Norris]] had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[F. Emasculata]]\", and was brought on to be Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and DEA agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/how-x-files-gave-birth-784003 |title=How 'X-Files' Gave Birth to 'Breaking Bad' |first=Aaron |last=Couch |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific accuracy ===\n[[Donna Nelson]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]], checked scripts and provided dialogue. She also drew [[chemical structure]]s and wrote [[chemical equation]]s which were used as props. According to creator Vince Gilligan,\n\n<blockquote>Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, \"I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand.\" She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, [[electrical engineering]], or [[physics]]. We try to get everything correct. There's no full-time [advisor] on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first.<ref name=\"AutoHY-14\" /></blockquote>\n\n\"Because Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists,\" says Gilligan. According to Gilligan, Nelson \"vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-15\" /> Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right, saying that Gilligan \"said it made a difference to him.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-16\" />\n\nSeveral episodes of ''[[Mythbusters]]'' featured attempts to validate or disprove scenes from ''Breaking Bad'', often with Gilligan guest-starring in the episode to participate. In 2013, two scenes from the first season of ''Breaking Bad'' were put under scrutiny in a [[MythBusters (2013 season)#Episode 206&nbsp;\u2013 \"Breaking Bad Special\"|''Mythbusters Breaking Bad'' special]].

The new method Walt chooses is a [[reductive amination]] reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and [[methylamine]]. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as [[phenylacetone]] or P2P) is produced from [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] using a [[tube furnace]] and [[thorium dioxide]] (ThO<sub>2</sub>) as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]], as mentioned in episodes \"A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\" and \"M\u00e1s\". P2P and methylamine form an [[imine]] intermediate; [[Redox|reduction]] of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using [[Aluminium amalgam|mercury aluminum amalgam]], as shown in several episodes including \"Hazard Pay\".<ref name=\"vice\" />\n\nOne of the important plot points in the series is that the crystal meth Walter \"cooks\" has very long crystals, is very pure, and (despite its purity) has a strong cyan blue color. Truly ultra-pure crystal meth would tend to be clear or white.<ref name=\"chemistry\"/>\n\nIn their article \"Die Chemie bei Breaking Bad\" on ''Chemie in unserer Zeit'' (translated into English on ''ChemistryViews'' as \"The Chemistry of ''Breaking Bad''\"), Tunga Salthammer and Falk Harnish discuss the plausibility of the chemistry portrayed in certain scenes. According to the two, chemistry is clearly depicted as a manufacturing science without much explanation of analytical methods being provided. On the other hand, serious scientific subjects are mixed into the dialogue in order to show a world where chemistry plays a key role.<ref name=\"chemistry\" />\n\n=== Technical aspects ===\n[[Michael Slovis]] was the cinematographer of ''Breaking Bad'' beginning with the second season and he received critical acclaim for his work throughout the series. Critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the TV series.

As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the name of \"Heisenberg\". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he <blockquote>... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again.

After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel, Walter adopts the name \"Heisenberg\", with his \"blue sky\" meth his signature product. Hank and the DEA become aware of this new figure in the drug trade and begin their investigation.\n\n=== Season 2 (2009) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nJesse's dealers become unsafe, and Walter hires Saul to connect them to Gus as a buyer for their latest batch. Jesse dates Jane, and she relapses on heroin; Jesse becomes unreliable. Walter refuses to pay him his half of the sale to Gus, but Jane blackmails Walter. Walter returns to Jesse to apologize, but allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. With Jesse in rehab, Walter seems content until he witnesses a midair collision of two planes, a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while on the job.\n\n=== Season 3 (2010) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nOn April 2, 2009, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a third, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-43\" /> It premiered on March 21, 2010, and concluded on June 13, 2010. The complete third season was released on Region 1 DVD and Region A Blu-ray on June 7, 2011.<ref name=\"s3 release\" />\n\nGus offers Walter a job cooking meth at a hidden lab. Walter demands Jesse be his assistant rather than Gus' choice of Gale. Skyler learns of Walter's meth cooking and demands a divorce. Hank's investigation leads him to Jesse, but finds no evidence and assaults Jesse, forcing him into a short leave. Hank is forewarned about an attack from two assassins, and kills them though he becomes paralyzed. Jesse's behavior becomes erratic, and Gus replaces him with Gale. Walter fears Gus will kill him and Jesse once Gale learns enough, and instructs Jesse to kill Gale.\n\n=== Season 4 (2011) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nOn June 14, 2010, AMC announced ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a fourth, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"season 4\" /> Production began in January 2011,<ref name=\"AutoHY-44\" /> the season premiered on July 17, 2011, and concluded on October 9, 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-45\" /> Originally, mini episodes of four minutes in length were to be produced before the premiere of the fourth season,<ref name=\"AutoHY-46\" /> but these did not come to fruition.<ref name=\"AutoHY-47\" />\n\nGus tightens security at the lab after Gale's death. Gus and Mike work to drive a wedge between Walter and Jesse, seeking to coerce Jesse to be their solitary cook while at the same time eliminating the Mexican cartel. Skyler accepts Walter's meth cooking, and works with Saul to launder his earnings. Hank, while recovering, tracks Gale's death to Gus and the drug trade. Gus releases Walter and plans to kill Hank. Walter tricks Jesse into turning against Gus, and convinces Hector to detonate a pipe bomb in the same room as Gus, killing them both.\n\n=== Season 5 (2012\u201313) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\nOn August 14, 2011, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" /> Season five is split into two parts, each consisting of 8 episodes.

When Todd kills a child witness during their theft of methylamine, Jesse and Mike sell their share to Declan. Walt produces meth for Declan, and Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful Walt makes {{USD|80 million}}, which he buries on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]]. Hank attempts to prove Walt is Heisenberg. Walt kills Mike and hires Jack's gang to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walt, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walt's money. Walt uses the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.\n\nWalt intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. He leaves his money in a trust Elliott and Gretchen will administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he dealt drugs because he liked it. At Jack's compound, Walt kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses and departs. Walt reminisces in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.\n\n== Themes and symbols ==\n\n=== Moral consequences ===\nIn an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', creator [[Vince Gilligan]] said the larger lesson of the series is that \"actions have consequences\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> He elaborated on the show's philosophy:\n\n{{quote|text=If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of [[Idi Amin]] living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for Biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that [[karma]] kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that's become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'}}\n\nIn a piece comparing the show to ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'', [[Chuck Klosterman]] said that ''Breaking Bad'' is \"built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live\". Klosterman added that the central question of ''Breaking Bad'' is: \"What makes a man 'bad'&nbsp;\u2013 his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?\" Klosterman concluded that, in the world of ''Breaking Bad'', \"goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else\".<ref name=\"grantland\" />\n\n[[Ross Douthat]] of ''The New York Times'', in a response to Klosterman's piece, compared ''Breaking Bad'' and ''The Sopranos'', stating that both series are \"[[morality play]]s\" that are \"both interested in [[moral agency]]\". Douthat went on to say that [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Tony Soprano]] \"represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation, and free will\". Walter is a man who \"deliberately abandons the light for the darkness\" while Tony is \"someone born and raised in darkness\" who turns down \"opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\" />\n\n=== Devotion to family ===\nThe show explores most of the main characters' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]] he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\" /> In the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|final episode of the series]], however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the $9.72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, Walt refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying, \"Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-29\" /> Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season.\n\nEven the show's more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]], Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that \"''La familia es todo''\" (\"Family is everything\"). Gustavo Fring's franchise ''Los Pollos Hermanos'' translates to \"The Chicken Brothers\". This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the first part of the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]], it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says \"don't skimp on family\", and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think Lydia abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, Lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia's daughter is important to how \"Lydia justified what she did to herself\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/30/breaking-bad-television |title=Breaking Bad's Lydia: 'Drinking camomile tea with milk is disgusting' |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Heritage |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Pink teddy bear ===\n[[File:Pink Teddy Bear from 'Breaking Bad'.jpg|thumb|The pink teddy bear as seen during the second season]]\nA [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] within the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]] is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the [[music video]] \"Fallacies\" for Jesse's band \"Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr\", which was released as a [[webisode]] in February 2009 leading to the second season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\" /> The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence \"[[Boeing 737|Seven Thirty-Seven]] down over [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|ABQ]]\".<ref name=\"nj\" /><ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"time\" /> The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'', in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.<ref name=\"Gilligan Answers Fan Questions\" /> At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes;<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-32\" /> the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize \"all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones\" and \"the judgment of God\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\" />\n\nIn the [[No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad)|first episode of the third season]], Walt finds the teddy bear's missing eye in the pool skimmer. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it \"a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for\",<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\" /> and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that \"the pink teddy bear continues to accuse\".<ref name=\"avc\" /> Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of [[Gus Fring]]'s face in the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\" />\n\nThe teddy bear prop was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|the show finale]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\" /><ref name=\"people\" />\n\n=== Walt Whitman ===\nWalter White's name is reminiscent of the poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"lat\"/> During the series, [[Gale Boetticher]] gives Walt a copy of Whitman's ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-37\" /> Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher recites \"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\" /> In the episode \"[[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|Bullet Points]]\", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher's notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt indicates that they must refer to Whitman.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hazard Pay]]\", Walt finds the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an especially high point in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, \"Song of Myself\", is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\" /> The mid-season finale of season five, \"[[Gliding Over All]]\", is titled after poem 271 of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\" /> In the episode, Hank finds ''Leaves of Grass'' in Walt's bathroom and opens it to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: \"To my <u>other</u> favorite W.W. It's an honour<!-- NOTICE TO EDITORS: THE NOTE SPELLS \"FAVORITE\" AND \"HONOUR\", SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SPELLING IN SPITE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY --> working with you. Fondly G.B.\" Upon reading this, Hank becomes visibly shocked, realizing the truth about Walter for the first time, which provides the opening premise for the second half of the final season.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ {{color|green|Metacritic}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-1}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-2}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-3}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-4}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-5}}</ref> and {{color|orange|Rotten Tomatoes}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s01 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s02 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s03 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s04 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s05 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> scores per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart |width=400 |height=200 |xAxisTitle=Season |yAxisTitle=Score |xType=string|type=line |showSymbols=true |colors=green,orange |x=1,2,3,4,5 |y1=73,84,89,96,99 |y2=83,100,100,100,100 |y1Title=Metacritic |y2Title=Rotten Tomatoes}}\n|}\n\n''Breaking Bad'' received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=\"greatest\" /> On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 73 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS1/> the second 84 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS2/> the third 89 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS3/> the fourth 96 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS4/> and the fifth 99 out of 100.<ref name=MetacriticS5/> The [[American Film Institute]] listed ''Breaking Bad'' as one of the top ten television series of 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"AutoHY-49\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-50\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-53\" /> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the ninth greatest TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |work=TV Guide |first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |first2=Matt |last2=Roush |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> By its end, the series was among the most-watched [[cable television|cable shows]] on American television, with audience numbers doubling from the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] to the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-54\" />  A 2015 ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named ''Breaking Bad'' as their #2 favorite show.<ref name=\"thr20150916\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-tv-shows-ever-top-819499/item/friends-hollywoods-100-favorite-tv-821361 |title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-07-17 |language=en}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it third on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/breaking-bad-w439638 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the first season, the series saw a generally positive reception. ''[[New York Post]]'' critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating \"Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say the two have created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-55\" /> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming \"There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-56\" />\n\nThe second season saw critical acclaim. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Ken Tucker]] stated \"''Bad'' is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again\u2014to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-57\" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for ''Breaking Bad'', now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-58\" /> Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-59\" />\n[[File:Aaron Paul, Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: [[Josh Sapan]] (AMC president and CEO), [[Aaron Paul]] ([[Jesse Pinkman]]), [[Vince Gilligan]] (creator), [[Bryan Cranston]] ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]) and Charlie Collier (President, general manager)]]\n\nThe third season also saw critical acclaim. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' proclaimed, \"It's a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it's all the hotter for that choice.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\" /> ''[[Newsday]]'' stated ''Breaking Bad'' was still TV's best series and it stayed true to itself.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\" /> Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the \"visual adventurousness\" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show's visuals \"a combination of staggering beauty&nbsp;\u2013 the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits&nbsp;\u2013 and transfixing weirdness.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\" /> After the finale aired, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that season three was \"one of television's finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting&nbsp;\u2013 what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing&nbsp;\u2013 is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, 'television good.' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-63\" />\n\nSeason four won near-universal critical acclaim. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' referred to the show as a \"taut exercise in withheld disaster\" and declared the show \"riveting\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-64\" /> The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' labeled the series \"smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\" /> Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\" /> ''Time'' listed Walter White's \"I am the one who knocks\" line as one of the best television lines of 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\" /> ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that \"''Breaking Bad'' is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-68\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'s}} review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on ''Breaking Bad''.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television&nbsp;\u2013 truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\" />\n\nBoth halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim. Following the end of the series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: \"Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, ''Breaking Bad'' is everything you could want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-70\" /> During the final season, the show also received praise from [[George R.

Along with creator Vince Gilligan, fellow writers and producers [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Thomas Schnauz]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]], [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], [[Sam Catlin]] and [[George Mastras]] joined to discuss memories from the show's humble beginnings, character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way. For instance, the character of [[Jesse Pinkman]] was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong. The reasoning behind this decision was that Jesse served his purpose \"in a meat-and-potatoes, logistical sense. The character would give Walt his entr\u00e9e into the business\" before meeting his demise. However, this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond Gilligan's early scripts.<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\nThe writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of [[storytelling]] evolved with the show. According to writer George Mastras,\n\n<blockquote>\"Screen time was precious, and infusing every moment with the emotion [was the point], not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story, which is hard enough. If you're going to take five seconds of screen time, you'd better damn well be sure that there's an emotion there. It may be very, very subtle, but trust the audiences to pick up on that, because audiences do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe development of certain characters posed challenges. [[Skyler White]] became unsympathetic to most viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to Walt's ultimate agenda. The writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that \"the only way people were going to like Skyler was if she started going along with what Walt was doing.\" It was a tricky shift to alter on screen because they didn't want to betray her character so they justified the change by using her past job as a [[bookkeeper]] to segue into her helping Walt [[money launder]] his cash under the guise of a car wash. Breaking the individual episodes was another form of problem solving for the writers. They stressed the importance of not letting the \"master plan\" stop them from staying true to the world they created. There came a point where tracking the characters on a moment-by-moment basis proved to be more useful rather than general direction of the story. Peter Gould said they would always start with the last thought in a character's head. \"Where's Jesse's head at? That was always the prelude to the breakthrough moment, because when you said that, it's usually because we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set-piece that we thought had to be there, but the characters didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\n=== Rian Johnson's experience on the show ===\n\nDirector [[Rian Johnson]] worked on three episodes (\"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", \"[[Fifty-One]]\" and \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\") and in an interview with [[IGN]] shared his memories from behind the camera. He shed some light on the process including the fact that he sat through \"tone meetings\" with Vince Gilligan. The two of them talked about every dramatic beat in a script, the distinct visual look of the show and how the tonal shift of each scene had to feel natural while serving the main storyline of the particular episode. Johnson also revealed that he learned so much about working with actors because of his directing of [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Aaron Paul]], describing the experience as a \"free masterclass.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/20/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-director-rian-johnson-looks-back-at-the-shows-legacy |title=Breaking Bad 10th Anniversary: Director Rian Johnson Looks Back at the Show's Legacy |publisher=IGN |first=Laura |last=Prudom |date=January 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the show's lasting legacy, Johnson offered up his thoughts,\n<blockquote>\"I think the seriousness and depth with which it took its characters is the thing that really makes it stand apart for me. And that's where the power of it comes from. Obviously, starting with [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], there's just very few stories that are told on that scale, that have a character who is that deeply considered at the center of it. And I've heard people describe it as [[Shakespearean]], and I know that word gets tossed around a lot, but I think in this case it really does apply. And that speaks, not so much to the fact that he goes to a dark place, but the fact that his entire journey is so deeply resonant, because it's so deeply considered.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Spin-offs and adaptations ==\n=== ''Met\u00e1stasis'' ===\nOn March 13, 2013, after several days of speculation fueled by [[Univision]],<ref name=\"remake\" /> [[Sony]] confirmed that it would be making a Spanish-language remake of ''Breaking Bad'' titled ''[[Met\u00e1stasis]]'' starring [[Diego Trujillo]] as Walter Blanco (Walter White) and Roberto Urbina as Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rosas (Jesse Pinkman), alongside Sandra Reyes and [[Juli\u00e1n Arango]] in unnamed roles.<ref name=\"remakeconfirm\" /> On October 2, 2013, the cast list was revealed to include Reyes as Cielo Blanco (Skyler White) and Arango as Henry Navarro (Hank Schrader), and that the show would be set in Colombia.<ref name=\"metacast\" /> The equivalent of [[Saul Goodman]] is named Sa\u00fal Bueno.<ref name=\"ns\" />\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul}}\nIn April 2013, it was revealed that AMC and Sony were interested in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series that would focus on Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), with Gilligan and series writer [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] developing the project.<ref name=\"AutoHY-79\" /> In September 2013, AMC and Sony Pictures Television officially ordered ''Better Call Saul'', set as a prequel to ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-80\" /> The series focuses on Saul's life 6 years before he became Walter's lawyer,<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\" /> and premiered on February 8, 2015.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\" /> ''Better Call Saul'' is currently airing its fifth season, with a sixth and final season to premiere in 2021.\n\n=== ''Talking Bad'' ===\nFrom August 11, 2013, to September 29, 2013, eight episodes of the live talk show, ''[[Talking Bad]]'', aired on AMC, following ''Breaking Bad''.

The Commonwealth and MBTA began to purchase several lines, like the [[Lowell Line]] between Somerville and Wilmington, from the B&M.\n\nIn 1969 the B&M transported 24,000 passengers every weekday on four separate routes. Its yearly deficit was {{USD|3.2 million}}. A pool of 86 [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s provided the service.<ref>{{Dorin-Commuter|p=13}}</ref> B&M filed for bankruptcy protection in 1970.

MBTA observers saw Amtrak as having been a reliable manager and operator, but Amtrak sometimes experienced strained relations with the MBTA.

However, the Commonwealth's support for rail operations began in the 1950s with contracted operations and subsidies to railroads providing commuter service, and more so in 1964 with the advent of MBTA.\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts pioneered the concept of \"Park and Ride\" by providing funds to construct the [[Route 128 Station]] on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 128]], the [[beltway]] encircling greater Boston.

However, MBTA does not operate electric equipment on the Providence Line, as such equipment would be unusable on other lines.\n*As [[Big Dig]] environmental mitigation, MBTA invested heavily in the Commuter Rail system by restoring large sections of the Old Colony division, which was abandoned in 1959. Service along the two main [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony Lines]] was reestablished in 1997, and the [[Greenbush Line]] opened in 2007.<ref name=netransit />\n*After 1975, [[Framingham/Worcester Line]] service was cut back to [[Framingham (MBTA station)|Framingham]], though other lines reached exurbs more distant from Boston than Framingham.

This was accomplished by a series of rationalizations, such as closing lightly used lines, concentrating service on heavily utilized lines, and re-opening formerly abandoned branches with high traffic potential, such as the Old Colony Lines. A general growth of transit usage in the [[Northeastern United States]] also contributed. Growing ridership in this way required substantial capital investment, which was provided by a mixture of Federal mass transit funds and Commonwealth transportation bond issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Train operations==\n[[File:Inbound Campello.JPG|thumb|An MBTA train at [[Campello (MBTA station)|Campello]] station inbound to South Station.]]\nLike most commuter railroads in the Northeastern United States, MBTA is a member of the [[Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee]] (NORAC) and uses the rulebook promulgated by that organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |title=NORAC Operating Rules |publisher=Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee |date=November 6, 2011 |edition=10 |via=National Transportation Safety Board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203171210/http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Much of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is governed by NORAC rule 251, as the tracks are signalled for movement in one direction of travel only. During the 1990s, parts of the system, such as the Framingham/Worcester Line, were re-signalled to allow a more advanced mode of operations known as NORAC rule 261, which allows trains to operate in either direction on both tracks where double track is available.

However, the Commonwealth's support for rail operations began in the 1950s with contracted operations and subsidies to railroads providing commuter service, and more so in 1964 with the advent of MBTA.\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts pioneered the concept of \"Park and Ride\" by providing funds to construct the [[Route 128 Station]] on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 128]], the [[beltway]] encircling greater Boston.

However, MBTA does not operate electric equipment on the Providence Line, as such equipment would be unusable on other lines.\n*As [[Big Dig]] environmental mitigation, MBTA invested heavily in the Commuter Rail system by restoring large sections of the Old Colony division, which was abandoned in 1959.

Growing ridership in this way required substantial capital investment, which was provided by a mixture of Federal mass transit funds and Commonwealth transportation bond issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Train operations==\n[[File:Inbound Campello.JPG|thumb|An MBTA train at [[Campello (MBTA station)|Campello]] station inbound to South Station.]]\nLike most commuter railroads in the Northeastern United States, MBTA is a member of the [[Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee]] (NORAC) and uses the rulebook promulgated by that organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |title=NORAC Operating Rules |publisher=Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee |date=November 6, 2011 |edition=10 |via=National Transportation Safety Board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203171210/http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Much of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is governed by NORAC rule 251, as the tracks are signalled for movement in one direction of travel only. During the 1990s, parts of the system, such as the Framingham/Worcester Line, were re-signalled to allow a more advanced mode of operations known as NORAC rule 261, which allows trains to operate in either direction on both tracks where double track is available. During the morning rush hour, both tracks can be simultaneously used for inbound traffic, allowing one train to make local stops while an express train overtakes the local train.<ref>{{cite web |author=Trahan, Tyler |title=The First T-Alert |url=http://iridethet.blogspot.com/2011/12/first-t-alert.html |date=December 9, 2011 |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn each train, the cab car is attached at the end closest to the downtown Boston terminal station for the particular line (either North or South Station), and the locomotive is attached at the end farthest from the terminal station. On each train serving the North Station lines, the \"ADA\" coach used to carry mobility-limited persons is attached next to the locomotive, allowing level boarding at all suburban stations featuring mini-high platforms. On the other hand, on each train serving the South Station lines, the cab car also serves as the \"ADA\" coach. (The \"ADA\" coaches support compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].)\n\nTrainlined doors that open automatically via central control are available on some equipment, but at low level platforms the conductor in each car must manually open a trap to allow passengers to descend via stairs onto the platform.\n\n[[Positive Train Control]] is scheduled to be implemented on the entire system per a federal mandate, which requires installation by the end of 2018 with the possibility of a two-year extension. {{As of|November 2015}}, the MBTA expects to complete PTC on the southside lines by December 2018, on the northside lines by March 2020, and an overlay for freight on the sections of [[Pan Am Railways]]' Freight Main Line which overlap MBTA territory by August 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Board_Meetings/FMCBPTCAward110215.pdf |title=Commuter Rail Positive Train Control (PTC) Project: Financial Management Control Board Presentation |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=November 2, 2015 |first=Gerard J. |last=Polcari |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Future operations===\nIn November 2019, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board voted to back plans to further electrify the Commuter Rail system and increase service along key corridors.

Both of those lines, as well as the Providence/Stoughton line, are also to be electrified under the plan. The projected cost of such plans were not immediately clear at the time of the board's vote, but projections range from $10.6 billion to $28.9 billion, depending upon the results of the pilot program and future possible expansion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2019/11/04/mbta-regional-rail-electric-trains |title=MBTA Board Commits To Reimagined Commuter Rail System |publisher=WBUR |date=November 4, 2019 |first=Chris |last=Lisinski |accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Planned expansions==\n<!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: When major updates are made to this section, be sure to also update the brief summary section in the main [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] article, which points to here. -->\n\n===South Station lines===\n{{Outdated|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Foxboro MBTA station, Foxborough MA.jpg|thumb|right|Foxboro station is proposed as the terminus of a Franklin Line branch]]\nThe [[South Coast Rail]] project is proposed to extend commuter rail service to the South Coast cities of [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and [[New Bedford]].

He made his second movie ''[[Kusume Rumal]]'' in 1985, based on his own story, which became very successful.\n\nAmong his movies, ''[[Kusume Rumal]]'', ''[[Lahure (film)|Lahure]]'', ''[[Deuta]]'', ''[[Chino (1991 film)|Chino]]'', ''Balidaan'', ''[[Dakshina (film)|Dakshina]]'' and ''[[Darpan Chhaya]]'' are considered hits.

{"title_page": "American Speed Association", "text_new": "{{distinguish|ASA Late Model Series}}\n{{short description|Motorsports organization of the United States}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n|logo=\n|sport=[[Auto racing]]\n|founded=1968\n|teams=\n|country={{USA}}\n}}\n\nThe '''American Speed Association''' ('''ASA''') was a sanctioning body of [[motorsport]]s in the [[United States]] formed in 1968. The Association was based in [[Pendleton, Indiana|Pendleton]], [[Indiana]], and later in [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]]. The ASA sanctioned asphalt and dirt tracks in their ASA Member Track program along with racing series in the United States and Canada. The organization has not been active since 2014.\n\nASA was most famous for a national touring series which began in 1973 but was discontinued in 2004 due to financial difficulties. In 2005, ASA became primarily a short track sanctioning clearinghouse under the leadership of Dennis Huth.\n\nThe cars from the ASA National tour also raced in [[England]] in  the now-defunct [[Stock Car Speed Association]] (formally ASCAR).\n\n== ASA National Tour ==\nThe national touring series used late model racecar body styles, where they raced primarily in the Midwest. Many series races were televised on several cable channels (especially [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network]]) from 1991 until 2004.\n\nASA is notable as the only nationally touring [[stock car racing|stock car]] series that used passenger car technology for its racing engines. Unlike [[NASCAR]], which up until 2012 required [[carburetor|carbureted]] engines for all its nationally touring series, ASA required [[fuel injection]] in all of its engines. During the mid-1980s, it also became one of the first stock car groups to offer a six-cylinder, lower-price alternative to the popular V8 engines, designed for less power but more race-capable for drivers. Following the 2000 rule changes, it was also known for introducing [[crate motors]] to a national audience. (NASCAR adopted [[crate motors]] in 2006 for the Grand National Division.)\n\n== MTV lawsuit ==\n\nIn 1991, [[Gaylord Entertainment]] (owners of The Nashville Network) and an independent production company, Group Five Sports, signed an agreement where the ASA would add live race broadcasts to their schedule.\n\nThe first live ASA AC-Delco Challenge Series race was held in June 1991 at [[Nashville Speedway USA]]. The race featured NASCAR star [[Darrell Waltrip]] (who won the ASA's first Challenge of Champions race in 1972) defeating ASA regular Bob Senneker. The exposure led to national television coverage for the entire season by TNN and Group Five doing the production.\n\nIn 1999, CBS (which purchased TNN in 1997) officials announced the purchase of 25% of the American Speed Association from owner Rex Robbins in exchange for live television rights to the entire ASA ACDelco Series schedule for five years. CBS did this move after losing coverage of NASCAR races, and the network chose to market the ASA on its CBS Cable family of networks (TNN and CMT).\n\nWhen [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] took over TNN in 2000, CBS Cable operations were shut down as TNN's Charlotte and Nashville offices were closed and the signals transferred to MTV Networks for the creation of a channel, Spike TV. At the time, MTV Networks honored its remaining motorsports contracts signed by CBS.\n\nIn August 2001, MTV ended its association with ASA and the [[World of Outlaws]] (which also had a TNN contract signed by CBS management) by announcing they would tape delay the popular sprint car [[Knoxville Nationals]], and also tape delay the two remaining ASA ACDelco Series races.\n\nThe ASA filed a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the tape delays, but dropped the lawsuit after MTV agreed to air one of the two races in the lawsuit live. MTV terminated the five-year CBS contract after less than 20 months.\n\nBrian Robbins, the son of the ASA founder Rex Robbins, blasted MTV, saying, \"It appears new (MTV) management does not have the same vision for the partnership as we had with TNN (CBS Cable) at the time we made the agreement.\"<ref name=\"autochan-agreement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/08/26/028165.html|title=ASA, TNN Reaches Agreement on 2001 Telecasts|last=Callahan|first=Terry|date=August 27, 2001|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"autochan-prevent-TNN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/08/22/027958.html|title=ASA Seeks to Prevent TNN From Tape Delaying Broadcasts|last=Callahan|first=Terry|date=August 23, 2001|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Sale of the sanctioning body ==\n\nThe 2003 season had drastic changes because of the move of television coverage to the lower-rated [[Speed Channel]]. Robbins ended his involvement with ASA.\n\nCar owner Steve Dale, along with a group of investors, purchased the ASA at the end of the 2003 season, and began massive changes for 2004 hoping for further expansion of the series.\n\nThe ASA then further expanded its Member Track program, hoping to deliver tracks to their side with a lower sanctioning fee than rival NASCAR's sanctioning fees. ASA did not have the high-dollar or high-exposure status NASCAR's [[Whelen All-American Series|Dodge Weekly Series]] offered.\n\n== Expansion of the ASA ==\nSteve Dale and the ASA purchased a fairly new Midwest-based late model series called the [[ASA Late Model Series|US Pro Series]]. The series used \"crate\" engines and \"template\" bodies to help develop a new \"Approved Body Configuration\" template for race cars. The standardized bodies saved money for teams at every track which wasn't a NASCAR-sanctioned track. The US Pro Series was renamed to the ASA Late Model Series. When the new ASA Late Model series began, it debuted with [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Tony Stewart]] racing in the inaugural race under the new name and ownership.\n\nThe ASA also purchased the Southern Modified Auto Racing Teams (SMART) organization in hopes to help sanction the series. SMART featured race cars similar to the Northeast-based NASCAR Modifieds.\n\nThe ASA also purchased the Speed Truck Challenge, a West Coast-based short-track series using fiberglass bodies designed to resemble compact pickup trucks.\n\nCar livery began to take a new look in 2004, with the cars having numbers on the rear fenders and sponsors on the door, which is opposite of what most stock cars traditionally have used.\n\n== Financial troubles of the 2004 season ==\nFinancial problems developed midway in the 2004 season when the ASA began to cancel races, and television contracts were canceled.\n\nBy the end of the season, the series' demise came when the series raced at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]]. During the driver's meeting for the 99-lap Aaron's 99 event (held after NASCAR [[Nextel Cup]] qualifying for the [[UAW-GM Quality 500]]), they informed competitors they did not have funds to pay teams after the race, and they asked for an extension. This despite the fact that Lowe's Motor Speedway had wired the entire purse and sanction fee to ASA as per the sanction agreement. Disappointed by Steve Dale's decision to cancel his trip to the event, the track impounded ASA's vehicles and equipment. A settlement was made where [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] (owners of [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] and Lowe's Motor Speedway) decided to pay the competitors directly after the final ASA race at Atlanta.\n\nThe sanctioning body collapsed and was shut down after the 2004 season, and the National Tour folded.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Member Track program and ASARACING.COM site were sold to Racing Speed Associates, which was run by former NASCAR official Dennis Huth, along with other ASA-sanctioned short track programs, the ASA Midwest Tour, ASA Midwest Truck Tour, ASA Truck Series, ASA Pro Truck Series, ASA ProAutoSports, ASA Advance Testing British Columbia Late Model Tour and the ASA NW Sprint Car Series (NSRA).\n\nNASCAR took advantage of the demise of the organization and started a Modified series in the Southeast, the [[Whelen Southern Modified Tour]]. The series features identical rules to NASCAR's northern brethren.\n\nThe American Stockcar League (which used the ASA-formula cars) was run under the sanctioning of [[Mid-American Stock Car Series|Mid-American Racing]] in an effort to keep the National Tour active.  The ASL ran only four races before its founder, Gary Vercauteren, died from a heart attack on October 6, 2005. Technical director and former racer Doug Strasburg took over Mid-American Racing, but conducted a major house cleaning early in 2006 and pared down Mid-American Racing, ending the ASL after only one season.\n\n== Dennis Huth era ==\nIn 2006, with NASCAR taking over the SMART modified tour, Racing Speed Associates started the ASA Southern Modified Racing Team concept to once again bring modifieds to the ASA.\n\nAlso, NASCAR announced it was ending its AutoZone Elite divisions, which featured regional late model racing, following the 2006 season.  Soon after, the ASA began sanctioning replacement series around the United States.  The ASA Midwest Tour and ASA Northwest Tour were launched for 2007 and the ASA Southeast Asphalt Tour for 2008.\n\nIn 2008, ASA began sanctioning the [[ISCARS]] sport compact series, which had been independent since breaking from NASCAR at the end of the 2003 season.  Also, the ASA Member Track program added a national short-track points championship similar to NASCAR's Whelen All-American Series concept, with the winner receiving a test with [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], which sponsors the program through its Joe Gibbs Driven Racing Oil brand.  The national champion earned a test in a Gibbs [[Toyota Camry]].\n\n== Related split / naming dispute ==\nThe related split of the assets of the former American Speed Association led to a naming dispute when the Late Model Series was reacquired by Ron Varney, while the other portions of the American Speed Association were sold to Huth.<ref>[http://www.asa-racing.com/story.asp?StoryID=7308 ASA completes purchase of National Tour properties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013170422/http://www.asa-racing.com/story.asp?StoryID=7308 |date=2007-10-13 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2007, Dennis Huth filed a lawsuit against the ASA Late Model Series seeking to invalidate and cancel the ASA Late Model Series trademark registration. The ASA Late Model Series responded that the lawsuit is frivolous and without merit and counter-sued Huth for damages caused by suit.\n<ref>[http://www.speed51.com/2007_stories/Specials/ASA_Name_LawSuit_Releases_12_5.html ASA name dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305162201/http://speed51.com/2007_stories/Specials/ASA_Name_LawSuit_Releases_12_5.html |date=2008-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2009, the naming dispute was settled.  Both parties were allowed to keep the \"ASA\" name, but the ASA Late Model Series was forced to come up with a new logo, and both parties agreed to inform the racing public that the ASA Late Model Series is not related to, affiliated with, nor sponsored or endorsed by American Speed Association or ASA Racing.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.racingonline.com/article/140109/dispute-over-asa-trademark-amicably-resolved |title=Dispute Over ASA Trademark Amicably Resolved |access-date=2009-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122094443/http://racingonline.com/article/140109/dispute-over-asa-trademark-amicably-resolved |archive-date=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn October 11, 2010, it was announced that in an order signed on October 7, 2010, by US District Court Judge Matthew Kennelly, has permanently barred Louis R. (Ron) Varney, Jr, ASA Late Model Series, LLC and all those acting in concert or participation with them, including specifically ASALMS, LLC from any further use of the ASA or ASA LATE MODEL SERIES brand on or in connection with automobile race events anywhere in the United States.  The injunction was delivered at the 2010 Oktoberfest Race Weekend at the [[La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway]].\n\n== ASA Free State 500 ==\nOn January 31, 2010, ASA Racing made history as the first American sanctioning body to race in the Republic of South Africa.  The ASA Free State 500 took place at the [[Phakisa Freeway]] located in Welkom, Free State, South Africa.

The Association was based in [[Pendleton, Indiana|Pendleton]], [[Indiana]], and later in [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]]. The ASA sanctioned asphalt and dirt tracks in their ASA Member Track program along with racing series in the United States and Canada. The organization has not been active since 2014.\n\nASA was most famous for a national touring series which began in 1973 but was discontinued in 2004 due to financial difficulties. In 2005, ASA became primarily a short track sanctioning clearinghouse under the leadership of Dennis Huth.\n\nThe cars from the ASA National tour also raced in [[England]] in  the now-defunct [[Stock Car Speed Association]] (formally ASCAR).\n\n== ASA National Tour ==\nThe national touring series used late model racecar body styles, where they raced primarily in the Midwest. Many series races were televised on several cable channels (especially [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network]]) from 1991 until 2004.\n\nASA is notable as the only nationally touring [[stock car racing|stock car]] series that used passenger car technology for its racing engines. Unlike [[NASCAR]], which up until 2012 required [[carburetor|carbureted]] engines for all its nationally touring series, ASA required [[fuel injection]] in all of its engines. During the mid-1980s, it also became one of the first stock car groups to offer a six-cylinder, lower-price alternative to the popular V8 engines, designed for less power but more race-capable for drivers. Following the 2000 rule changes, it was also known for introducing [[crate motors]] to a national audience. (NASCAR adopted [[crate motors]] in 2006 for the Grand National Division.)\n\n== MTV lawsuit ==\n\nIn 1991, [[Gaylord Entertainment]] (owners of The Nashville Network) and an independent production company, Group Five Sports, signed an agreement where the ASA would add live race broadcasts to their schedule.\n\nThe first live ASA AC-Delco Challenge Series race was held in June 1991 at [[Nashville Speedway USA]]. The race featured NASCAR star [[Darrell Waltrip]] (who won the ASA's first Challenge of Champions race in 1972) defeating ASA regular Bob Senneker. The exposure led to national television coverage for the entire season by TNN and Group Five doing the production.\n\nIn 1999, CBS (which purchased TNN in 1997) officials announced the purchase of 25% of the American Speed Association from owner Rex Robbins in exchange for live television rights to the entire ASA ACDelco Series schedule for five years. CBS did this move after losing coverage of NASCAR races, and the network chose to market the ASA on its CBS Cable family of networks (TNN and CMT).\n\nWhen [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] took over TNN in 2000, CBS Cable operations were shut down as TNN's Charlotte and Nashville offices were closed and the signals transferred to MTV Networks for the creation of a channel, Spike TV. At the time, MTV Networks honored its remaining motorsports contracts signed by CBS.\n\nIn August 2001, MTV ended its association with ASA and the [[World of Outlaws]] (which also had a TNN contract signed by CBS management) by announcing they would tape delay the popular sprint car [[Knoxville Nationals]], and also tape delay the two remaining ASA ACDelco Series races.\n\nThe ASA filed a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the tape delays, but dropped the lawsuit after MTV agreed to air one of the two races in the lawsuit live. MTV terminated the five-year CBS contract after less than 20 months.\n\nBrian Robbins, the son of the ASA founder Rex Robbins, blasted MTV, saying, \"It appears new (MTV) management does not have the same vision for the partnership as we had with TNN (CBS Cable) at the time we made the agreement.\"<ref name=\"autochan-agreement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/08/26/028165.html|title=ASA, TNN Reaches Agreement on 2001 Telecasts|last=Callahan|first=Terry|date=August 27, 2001|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"autochan-prevent-TNN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/08/22/027958.html|title=ASA Seeks to Prevent TNN From Tape Delaying Broadcasts|last=Callahan|first=Terry|date=August 23, 2001|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Sale of the sanctioning body ==\n\nThe 2003 season had drastic changes because of the move of television coverage to the lower-rated [[Speed Channel]]. Robbins ended his involvement with ASA.\n\nCar owner Steve Dale, along with a group of investors, purchased the ASA at the end of the 2003 season, and began massive changes for 2004 hoping for further expansion of the series.\n\nThe ASA then further expanded its Member Track program, hoping to deliver tracks to their side with a lower sanctioning fee than rival NASCAR's sanctioning fees. ASA did not have the high-dollar or high-exposure status NASCAR's [[Whelen All-American Series|Dodge Weekly Series]] offered.\n\n== Expansion of the ASA ==\nSteve Dale and the ASA purchased a fairly new Midwest-based late model series called the [[ASA Late Model Series|US Pro Series]]. The series used \"crate\" engines and \"template\" bodies to help develop a new \"Approved Body Configuration\" template for race cars. The standardized bodies saved money for teams at every track which wasn't a NASCAR-sanctioned track. The US Pro Series was renamed to the ASA Late Model Series. When the new ASA Late Model series began, it debuted with [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Tony Stewart]] racing in the inaugural race under the new name and ownership.\n\nThe ASA also purchased the Southern Modified Auto Racing Teams (SMART) organization in hopes to help sanction the series. SMART featured race cars similar to the Northeast-based NASCAR Modifieds.\n\nThe ASA also purchased the Speed Truck Challenge, a West Coast-based short-track series using fiberglass bodies designed to resemble compact pickup trucks.\n\nCar livery began to take a new look in 2004, with the cars having numbers on the rear fenders and sponsors on the door, which is opposite of what most stock cars traditionally have used.\n\n== Financial troubles of the 2004 season ==\nFinancial problems developed midway in the 2004 season when the ASA began to cancel races, and television contracts were canceled.\n\nBy the end of the season, the series' demise came when the series raced at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]]. During the driver's meeting for the 99-lap Aaron's 99 event (held after NASCAR [[Nextel Cup]] qualifying for the [[UAW-GM Quality 500]]), they informed competitors they did not have funds to pay teams after the race, and they asked for an extension. This despite the fact that Lowe's Motor Speedway had wired the entire purse and sanction fee to ASA as per the sanction agreement. Disappointed by Steve Dale's decision to cancel his trip to the event, the track impounded ASA's vehicles and equipment. A settlement was made where [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] (owners of [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] and Lowe's Motor Speedway) decided to pay the competitors directly after the final ASA race at Atlanta.\n\nThe sanctioning body collapsed and was shut down after the 2004 season, and the National Tour folded.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Member Track program and ASARACING.COM site were sold to Racing Speed Associates, which was run by former NASCAR official Dennis Huth, along with other ASA-sanctioned short track programs, the ASA Midwest Tour, ASA Midwest Truck Tour, ASA Truck Series, ASA Pro Truck Series, ASA ProAutoSports, ASA Advance Testing British Columbia Late Model Tour and the ASA NW Sprint Car Series (NSRA).\n\nNASCAR took advantage of the demise of the organization and started a Modified series in the Southeast, the [[Whelen Southern Modified Tour]]. The series features identical rules to NASCAR's northern brethren.\n\nThe American Stockcar League (which used the ASA-formula cars) was run under the sanctioning of [[Mid-American Stock Car Series|Mid-American Racing]] in an effort to keep the National Tour active.  The ASL ran only four races before its founder, Gary Vercauteren, died from a heart attack on October 6, 2005. Technical director and former racer Doug Strasburg took over Mid-American Racing, but conducted a major house cleaning early in 2006 and pared down Mid-American Racing, ending the ASL after only one season.\n\n== Dennis Huth era ==\nIn 2006, with NASCAR taking over the SMART modified tour, Racing Speed Associates started the ASA Southern Modified Racing Team concept to once again bring modifieds to the ASA.\n\nAlso, NASCAR announced it was ending its AutoZone Elite divisions, which featured regional late model racing, following the 2006 season.  Soon after, the ASA began sanctioning replacement series around the United States.  The ASA Midwest Tour and ASA Northwest Tour were launched for 2007 and the ASA Southeast Asphalt Tour for 2008.\n\nIn 2008, ASA began sanctioning the [[ISCARS]] sport compact series, which had been independent since breaking from NASCAR at the end of the 2003 season.  Also, the ASA Member Track program added a national short-track points championship similar to NASCAR's Whelen All-American Series concept, with the winner receiving a test with [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], which sponsors the program through its Joe Gibbs Driven Racing Oil brand.  The national champion earned a test in a Gibbs [[Toyota Camry]].\n\n== Related split / naming dispute ==\nThe related split of the assets of the former American Speed Association led to a naming dispute when the Late Model Series was reacquired by Ron Varney, while the other portions of the American Speed Association were sold to Huth.<ref>[http://www.asa-racing.com/story.asp?StoryID=7308 ASA completes purchase of National Tour properties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013170422/http://www.asa-racing.com/story.asp?StoryID=7308 |date=2007-10-13 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2007, Dennis Huth filed a lawsuit against the ASA Late Model Series seeking to invalidate and cancel the ASA Late Model Series trademark registration. The ASA Late Model Series responded that the lawsuit is frivolous and without merit and counter-sued Huth for damages caused by suit.\n<ref>[http://www.speed51.com/2007_stories/Specials/ASA_Name_LawSuit_Releases_12_5.html ASA name dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305162201/http://speed51.com/2007_stories/Specials/ASA_Name_LawSuit_Releases_12_5.html |date=2008-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2009, the naming dispute was settled.  Both parties were allowed to keep the \"ASA\" name, but the ASA Late Model Series was forced to come up with a new logo, and both parties agreed to inform the racing public that the ASA Late Model Series is not related to, affiliated with, nor sponsored or endorsed by American Speed Association or ASA Racing.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.racingonline.com/article/140109/dispute-over-asa-trademark-amicably-resolved |title=Dispute Over ASA Trademark Amicably Resolved |access-date=2009-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122094443/http://racingonline.com/article/140109/dispute-over-asa-trademark-amicably-resolved |archive-date=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn October 11, 2010, it was announced that in an order signed on October 7, 2010, by US District Court Judge Matthew Kennelly, has permanently barred Louis R. (Ron) Varney, Jr, ASA Late Model Series, LLC and all those acting in concert or participation with them, including specifically ASALMS, LLC from any further use of the ASA or ASA LATE MODEL SERIES brand on or in connection with automobile race events anywhere in the United States.  The injunction was delivered at the 2010 Oktoberfest Race Weekend at the [[La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway]].\n\n== ASA Free State 500 ==\nOn January 31, 2010, ASA Racing made history as the first American sanctioning body to race in the Republic of South Africa.  The ASA Free State 500 took place at the [[Phakisa Freeway]] located in Welkom, Free State, South Africa.  John Mickel from the United Kingdom passed Toni McCray from California on the last lap to win the 207-lap (500&nbsp;km) event.\n\n== List of ASA National Champions ==\n*2013 Dalton Zehr - ASA Member Track National Champion - [[Norway Speedway]]\n*2012 Shelby Stroebel - ASA Member Track National Champion - [[Meridian Speedway]]\n*2011 [[Barry Beggarly]] - ASA Member Track National Champion - [[Ace Speedway]]\n*2010 Bryan Wordelman - ASA Member Track National Champion - Rocky Mountain Raceways\n*2009 Tommy Cloce - ASA Member Track National Champion - Adirondack Speedway\n*2008 Cary Stapp - ASA Member Track National Champion - Thunderhill Raceway\n*2005 [[Bryan Reffner]] - Awarded Championship for the 2005 ASL Season\n*2004 [[Kevin Cywinski]]\n*2003 [[Kevin Cywinski]]\n*2002 [[Joey Clanton]]\n*2001 [[Johnny Sauter]]\n*2000 [[Gary St. Amant]]\n*1999 [[Tim Sauter]]\n*1998 [[Gary St. Amant]]\n*1997 [[Kevin Cywinski]]\n*1996 [[Tony Raines]]\n*1995 [[Bryan Reffner]]\n*1994 [[Butch Miller (racing driver)|Butch Miller]]\n*1993 [[Johnny Benson]]\n*1992 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1991 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1990 [[Bob Senneker]]\n*1989 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1988 [[Butch Miller (racing driver)|Butch Miller]]\n*1987 [[Butch Miller (racing driver)|Butch Miller]]\n*1986 [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]]\n*1985 [[Dick Trickle]]\n*1984 [[Dick Trickle]]\n*1983 [[Rusty Wallace]]\n*1982 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1981 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1980 [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]]\n*1979 [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]]\n*1978 [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]]\n*1977 [[Dave Watson]]\n*1976 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1975 [[Moose Myers]]\n*1974 [[Mike Eddy]]\n*1973 [[Dave Sorg]]\n\n== Pat Schauer Memorial Rookies of the Year ==\n\n''Brief history of the award''\n\nSchauer, of Watertown, WI, was killed October 4, 1981, at [[Winchester Speedway]] during an ASA race.

{"title_page": "Anarchism in Greece", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Anarchism sidebar |By region}}\n\n'''Anarchism in Greece''' can trace its roots to [[ancient Greece]] but was formed as a political movement during the 19th century. It was in the ancient era that the first [[anarchist philosophy|libertarian thoughts]] appeared when [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophers]] based on [[rationality]] questioned the fundamentals of tradition. Modern anarchism in Greece emerged in the 19th century, heavily influenced by the contemporary [[history of anarchism#Late 19th century to early 20th century, anarchism as a worker's movement|European classical anarchism]]. Because of the [[Bolshevik]] success in the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the rise of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]], anarchism faded after the first decades of the 20th century. [[Greek_military_junta_of_1967\u20131974#Collapse|The collapse of the military Junta]] put an end to the monopoly of the political power from the Right, whereas [[Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|the dissolution of the Soviet Union]] diminished the allure of the KKE, allowing anarchist groups to gain pace in Athens and other cities. \n\n== Precursors ==\n\n{{see also|Precursors to anarchism}}\n\nBeliefs, opinions and sentiments that are close to anarchist core values were expressed in Ancient Greece. With the appearance of [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|presocratic thought]], rational inquiry during the classical and Hellenistic period, challenged traditional beliefs, religion and authority itself. [[Socrates]] scepticism towards the state and its passionate support of the individual's moral freedom were among the first-ever libertarian critiques.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=67}} Cynics' contribution to philosophical anarchism was the distinction between the man-made laws and nature's law, fiercely rejecting the former.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=68-69}} Stoics followed the same worldview and Zeno of Citium, the main stoic philosopher, received the admiration of 19th-century anarchist, Piotr Kropotkin who was impressed by Zeno's Republic- a community based on egalitarianism and friendly relations.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=69-70}} A powerful play resonating with anarchism was [[Antigone (Euripides play)|Antigone]], by [[Sophocles]], where a young woman defies the orders of the Ruler and acts according to her consciousness.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=66}}\n\n== Ottoman era==\nAccording to some academics, shortly before and after the end of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in Greece, the socioeconomic relations of the Greek countryside reflected traits of Bakunian collectivism (decentralization and autonomy) creating a future audience for anarchist ideas.<!-- is this too speculative?-->{{sfn|Alexandrakis|2010|p=74}} Discussing the second half of the 19th century, a source argued that the level of anarchist activity in the Ottoman Empire was comparable to that in Europe. {{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=554}} Some of the Greek anarchists were born in the Ottoman Empire, for example Emmanouil Dadaoglou was from Izmir. {{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=567}}\n\nAccording to a study of anarchism in the late Ottoman Empire by Axel Corlu, Greek anarchists were significantly less in their Armenian or Bulgarian counterparts in the leftovers of Ottoman Empire at the end of the 19th century. Corlu suggests that Greek anarchists were mostly focused in influencing events, struggles and structures of the Greek state rather than the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=567}}\n\n== Early anarchism  ==\n\n[[File:Greek Democracy Revolution masthead.jpg|thumb|left|''Greek Democracy'' was the first anarchist paper in Greece. Its slogan: \"Revolution is the law of progress.\"]]\n[[File:Gemidjii arrest thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bulgarian postcard depicting the arrest of [[Gemidzhii]]'s living members, in Salonika, April 1903]]\n\nEarly anarchism in Greece traces to the mid-19th century and lasted through [[World War II]].{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009|p=1}} This period is characterized by collaboration with other socialists as early Greek socialist thought was dominated by anarchism.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=104}} The most influential authors at the time were Bakunin, Andrea Costa, Kropotkin and Jean Grave;{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=104}} for comparison, Marx and Engels were not translated in Greek until 1893. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=105}}Individuals having ties with Italy and Italian immigrants imported anarchism to the Greek mainland with the Ionian islands as a midpoint.  Many of the anarchist intellectuals came from the upper classes. Popular support was gained through opposition to taxation and the current crisis. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was an influence over the whole Greek socialist movement at this period, and some anarchists combined anarchism with irredentism.  The participation of women was limited. Anarchism flourished particularly in the Western Peloponnese. Geographical proximity to Italy explains why the [[Patras|port town of Patras]] saw the first organised anarchist group. {{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87-89}} Patras had organized meeting places, a viable local press and publishing activity.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=53}} \n\nVarious individuals were inspired by the expansion of [[history of anarchism#Late 19th century to early 20th century, anarchism as a worker's movement|European classical Anarchism]]. The first anarchist publication in Greece appeared in September 1861, in the daily newspaper \"{{lang|el|\u03a6\u03ce\u03c2}}\" (''Light''), issue 334. In the main article of the paper, titled \"Anarchy\", part A, an anonymous writer employed classical anti-authoritarian rhetoric.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87}}\n\nThe first Greek-organised anarchist group was the Democratic Club of Patras (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2). Founded in 1876 and affiliated with the anti-authoritarian [[Jura Federation]] of the [[First International]],{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009|p=1}}{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87}} the Democratic Club helped to create a federated network of similar Greek groups. They also published the first anarchist newspaper in Greece, ''Greek Democracy'' (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1).{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=88}} In its declaration of principles, the Democratic Club claimed that \"poverty and ignorance are the greatest wounds of the people\" and supported the liberation of Greeks in the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=147-148}} Emmanouil Dadaoglou and the Italian [[Amilcare Cipriani]] were involved in the club's founding, having previously participated with other anarchists in the [[1862 Athens uprising]], though details of Dadaoglou's life are unverified.{{sfn|Moskoff|1985|p=152, 152n1}}\n\nIn 1876, an anarchist working club was founded in [[Syros]]. It played an instrumental role in the tannery and shipyard strikes of 1879.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}}\n\n[[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]], a Peloponnese city close to Patras, was another place that anarchist ideas flourished along with other socialist currents. The fight against loan sharks and the heavy taxation by the state fueled anarchist thought among small raisin producers in the Peloponnese which was the home of various anarchist groups in the late 19th century. ''New Light'' (\u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2) was a western Peloponnese weekly newspaper that voiced anarchist ideas (local and international). It was first published in October 1898 by the lawyer Vasileios Theodoridis. Its aim was to unify the subversive people of the Western Peloponnese to face the social problem. The newspaper contained articles of Drakoulis, translations of the works of Paul Argyriad\u00e8s, republications of texts that first appeared in Athenian magazines and news about the Greek and the international labour movement. It also contained adages of the Orthodox Church Fathers and [[Charles Fourier]] as well as translations of texts by Bakunin, Kropotkin and Girard. <!-- Girard is the name mentioned by Noutsos but I cant find who this person is--> {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=87-91}} The publisher of \u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 was the journalist Dimos. Papathanasiou. In a 1861 article in \u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 <!--Noutsos mentions it simply as Fos not Neon Fos-->, entitled \"Anarchy as the greatest good\", he claimed that state authorities live at the expense of the people. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=130-133}} \n\nThe anarchist groups of the Peloponnese were the strongest in Greece until the early 20th century. They had a lively propaganda work in the cities and their surroundings as opposed to \"authoritarian\" socialists who were more interested in parliamentary politics. They encouraged abstention in the elections of 1899 and mobilized against loan sharks and taxation in the name of raisin producers. They did not seek the support of the state to confront the currant crisis but rather to denounce state mechanisms of oppression. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=90-91}}\n\nZestful socialist [[Stavros Kallergis]] was arguing in ''The Socialist'' (a newspaper he was editing) that socialism is the path towards Anarchism. ''The Socialist'' was funnelling the contemporary socialist thought of Europe, ranging from moderate socialist to anarchist opinions, during the 1890s.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=68-70}}\n\nPersecution against anarchists intensified in the summer of 1894. The assassination of [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] by an anarchist led to a barrage of attacks against the anarchists by the press, and in particular by Asty, the official organ of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]' party. Many anarchists and socialists were put on trial and this led others to either flee the country or relocate in isolated parts of Greece. Similarly, many radical publications closed down and mainstream activity was reduced. <ref>{{cite book |last=\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03cc\u03b6\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 |first= \u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2|date= 2013|title=\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7 \u2212 \u03a8\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2|url=https://www.academia.edu/3717626|location=Athens |publisher=\u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 |page= 35\u201337|isbn= |author-link=}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1896 in Patras, Dimitrios Matsalis, a sandal maker, murdered Dionysios Fragkopoulos, a banker and currant merchant and injured Andreas Kollas. He declared that \"I acted alone. By killing I did not aim at people but I stroke the capital. I am an anarchist and as an anarchist I am in favour of violence.\" He committed suicide in prison.

Mikhail Bakunin's ''[[God and the State]]'' and [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''Law and Authority'' followed. The \"Black Rose\" bookshop carried these publications of \"Diethnis Vivliothiki\" (\"International Library\").{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=110}} Interest in anarchism swelled with the anti-junta movement, and the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] was a flashpoint for the junta's opposition.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} The group that initiated the Polytechnic uprising included a minority of anarchists and leftists, who sought the fall of capitalism in addition to the group's common aim: the reinstatement of democracy.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Anarchists were branded as ''provocateurs'' by the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] as they were expressing slogans not directly related to the student's demands (i.e. they were calling for sexual freedom, social revolution and the abolition of the State). The resonance with the French 1968 movement was clear. {{sfn|Kornetis|2013|pp=260}} Some demonstrators also used slogans with anarchist overtones, such as \"Down with Authority\" and \"People Revolt\".{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} The uprising became an emboldening symbol for the anarchists and leftists' unfulfilled vision, as if the occupation never ended.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The uprising is commemorated annually with a multi-day march. Anarchists use the occasion to denounce the political regime. The marches traditionally end with skirmishes between anarchists and police in [[Exarcheia]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} The annual protests promote a subculture that sees resistance of authority as one's duty.{{sfn|Andronikidou|Kovras|2012|p=713|ps=. \"The memory of the Polytechnic has made two overlapping contributions to the cultivation of a culture of resistance. First, the protesting youth acquired independent agency. Only the student movement overtly resisted the dictatorship. Second, the memory of the Polytechnic has institutionalised the individual\u2019s 'duty to resist authority{{'\"}}}}\n\nGreek anarchism remained a small [[subculture]] after the fall of the junta, but grew into a movement following riots in 1981.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=71\u201372}}{{clarify|date=September 2019|reason=The 1981 riots? Or the 1980 Polytechnic riots?}} The university occupation movement of 1979\u20131981 was largely instigated by Anarchist and leftist groups. Near the Polytechnic, the student neighbourhood of Exarcheia became a \"free zone\", where leftists, Anarchists, hippies, and others were in charge.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=113}} A big moment for the anarchist movement that helped attest self-confidence was the anarchist demonstration on the hotel \"Caravel\" hosting a far-right conference (among the participants was [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]).{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=113\u2013115}}{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=72}} \n\nDemonstrations and clashes between anarchists and police took place almost daily in Athens between 1985 and 1986.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=75}} The confrontation between the police and anarchists escalated during the 1985 Polytechnic uprising anniversary demonstration when a group of anarchists set a riot police car on fire. One of the riot policemen, Athanassios Melistas, shot a 15-year-old anarchist, [[Michalis Kaltezas]], in the back of the head, killing him instantly and sparking large riots in Athens and Thessaloniki and the occupation of the University of Athens's Chemistry Department. The government's reaction to the occupation made the oppression against anarchists almost unbearable,{{how?|date=September 2019}} but the anarchist movement survived and staged demonstrations with thousands of participants in Athens.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=113-15}} In retaliation against Melistas,{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} the [[17 November Group]] killed  Nikolaos Georgakopoulos and injured fourteen other [[Units_for_the_Reinstatement_of_Order|MAT]] officers in a 1985 bus bombing.{{sfn|Marinos|2010}}{{sfn|Kiesling|2014|pp=137-149}}\n\nThe anarchists proposal was in contrast to the legalistic approach of The Greek Communist Party (KKE), which was enjoying by then parliamentary participation.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=112-13}}{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=72}} Exarcheia was increasingly becoming a no go zone for police as clashes occurred merely with the sight of officers.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=73}}\n\nAlternative media and punk subcultures proliferated anarchist thought among Greek youth in the 1980s and 1990s. This collectively owned media spread messages against [[neoliberalism]], [[reactionary populism]], [[liberal democracy]], and [[the state]].{{sfn|Siapera|Theodosiadis|2017|p=508}} By the late 1980s, anarchism had turned towards a broader spectrum of issues: gender inequalities, patriarchy, racism towards immigrants, and ethnic minority repression (Slavic and Turkish). Anarchist [[Squatting|squats]] emerged in this era, among which [[Villa Amalia (Athens)|Villa Amalia]] and Villa Lela Karagianni were the most prominent.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=76}}\n\n== Contemporary ==\n\nThe self-collapse of the USSR had a profound impact not only on anarchism but on Greece as well. Greek anarchism reached a peak of activity between 1989 and 1995, reinforced by a disappointment with Greek mainstream politics.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} The 1990-93 [[Konstantinos_Mitsotakis|Mitsotakis]] government agenda included an attempt to enforce [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies. The 1990s was the era that the anti-authoritarian movement became more prominent and had active participation among student riots against government plans for the privatization of the education sector.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009|p=2}} The most circulated publications were ''The Void Network'' and ''The Children of the Gallery''.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|pp=117-18}}\n\nIn the new century, with capital and neoliberalism advancing victoriously through the world, Greek anarchist participated in the [[anti-globalization movement]].{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|pp=120-23}}<!--mentioned here too, if needed {{sfn|Siapera|Theodosiadis|2017|p=509}}--> New collectives, such as the ''Antieksousiastiki kinisi'' in Exarcheia and its associated newspaper, Babylonia, became popular among rebellious youth.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=126}} Athens Indymedia and Antieksousiastiki kinisi were formed in 2001 and 2003 respectively.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=80}}\n\nDecember 2008 saw [[2008 Greek riots|massive protests]] after the lethal [[2008_Greek_riots#The_shooting_incident|shooting of  15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos]] by a policeman in [[Exarcheia|Exarcheia, Athens]]. Within an hour, anarchists, leftists, and sympathizers rioted and attacked banks, police vehicles and government offices in the area. The government's attempts for a cover-up {{Citation needed|reason=it would help to get more specific here. iirc not all sources accept that there was an attempt to cover up|date=September 2019}}and refusal to apologize brought thousands to the streets for daily clashes and demonstrations, that were disseminated to other cities as well. The parliament building was besieged for weeks by angry crowds. Major violence erupted during one of the marches, with rioters attacking and setting fire to many public buildings, banks, and shops.

It was in the ancient era that the first [[anarchist philosophy|libertarian thoughts]] appeared when [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophers]] based on [[rationality]] questioned the fundamentals of tradition. Modern anarchism in Greece emerged in the 19th century, heavily influenced by the contemporary [[history of anarchism#Late 19th century to early 20th century, anarchism as a worker's movement|European classical anarchism]]. Because of the [[Bolshevik]] success in the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the rise of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]], anarchism faded after the first decades of the 20th century. [[Greek_military_junta_of_1967\u20131974#Collapse|The collapse of the military Junta]] put an end to the monopoly of the political power from the Right, whereas [[Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|the dissolution of the Soviet Union]] diminished the allure of the KKE, allowing anarchist groups to gain pace in Athens and other cities. \n\n== Precursors ==\n\n{{see also|Precursors to anarchism}}\n\nBeliefs, opinions and sentiments that are close to anarchist core values were expressed in Ancient Greece. With the appearance of [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|presocratic thought]], rational inquiry during the classical and Hellenistic period, challenged traditional beliefs, religion and authority itself. [[Socrates]] scepticism towards the state and its passionate support of the individual's moral freedom were among the first-ever libertarian critiques.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=67}} Cynics' contribution to philosophical anarchism was the distinction between the man-made laws and nature's law, fiercely rejecting the former.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=68-69}} Stoics followed the same worldview and Zeno of Citium, the main stoic philosopher, received the admiration of 19th-century anarchist, Piotr Kropotkin who was impressed by Zeno's Republic- a community based on egalitarianism and friendly relations.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=69-70}} A powerful play resonating with anarchism was [[Antigone (Euripides play)|Antigone]], by [[Sophocles]], where a young woman defies the orders of the Ruler and acts according to her consciousness.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=66}}\n\n== Ottoman era==\nAccording to some academics, shortly before and after the end of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in Greece, the socioeconomic relations of the Greek countryside reflected traits of Bakunian collectivism (decentralization and autonomy) creating a future audience for anarchist ideas.<!-- is this too speculative?-->{{sfn|Alexandrakis|2010|p=74}} Discussing the second half of the 19th century, a source argued that the level of anarchist activity in the Ottoman Empire was comparable to that in Europe. {{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=554}} Some of the Greek anarchists were born in the Ottoman Empire, for example Emmanouil Dadaoglou was from Izmir. {{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=567}}\n\nAccording to a study of anarchism in the late Ottoman Empire by Axel Corlu, Greek anarchists were significantly less in their Armenian or Bulgarian counterparts in the leftovers of Ottoman Empire at the end of the 19th century. Corlu suggests that Greek anarchists were mostly focused in influencing events, struggles and structures of the Greek state rather than the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Corlu|2016|p=567}}\n\n== Early anarchism  ==\n\n[[File:Greek Democracy Revolution masthead.jpg|thumb|left|''Greek Democracy'' was the first anarchist paper in Greece. Its slogan: \"Revolution is the law of progress.\"]]\n[[File:Gemidjii arrest thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bulgarian postcard depicting the arrest of [[Gemidzhii]]'s living members, in Salonika, April 1903]]\n\nEarly anarchism in Greece traces to the mid-19th century and lasted through [[World War II]].{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009|p=1}} This period is characterized by collaboration with other socialists as early Greek socialist thought was dominated by anarchism.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=104}} The most influential authors at the time were Bakunin, Andrea Costa, Kropotkin and Jean Grave;{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=104}} for comparison, Marx and Engels were not translated in Greek until 1893. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=105}}Individuals having ties with Italy and Italian immigrants imported anarchism to the Greek mainland with the Ionian islands as a midpoint.  Many of the anarchist intellectuals came from the upper classes. Popular support was gained through opposition to taxation and the current crisis. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was an influence over the whole Greek socialist movement at this period, and some anarchists combined anarchism with irredentism.  The participation of women was limited. Anarchism flourished particularly in the Western Peloponnese. Geographical proximity to Italy explains why the [[Patras|port town of Patras]] saw the first organised anarchist group. {{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87-89}} Patras had organized meeting places, a viable local press and publishing activity.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|p=53}} \n\nVarious individuals were inspired by the expansion of [[history of anarchism#Late 19th century to early 20th century, anarchism as a worker's movement|European classical Anarchism]]. The first anarchist publication in Greece appeared in September 1861, in the daily newspaper \"{{lang|el|\u03a6\u03ce\u03c2}}\" (''Light''), issue 334. In the main article of the paper, titled \"Anarchy\", part A, an anonymous writer employed classical anti-authoritarian rhetoric.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87}}\n\nThe first Greek-organised anarchist group was the Democratic Club of Patras (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2). Founded in 1876 and affiliated with the anti-authoritarian [[Jura Federation]] of the [[First International]],{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009|p=1}}{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=87}} the Democratic Club helped to create a federated network of similar Greek groups. They also published the first anarchist newspaper in Greece, ''Greek Democracy'' (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1).{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=88}} In its declaration of principles, the Democratic Club claimed that \"poverty and ignorance are the greatest wounds of the people\" and supported the liberation of Greeks in the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=147-148}} Emmanouil Dadaoglou and the Italian [[Amilcare Cipriani]] were involved in the club's founding, having previously participated with other anarchists in the [[1862 Athens uprising]], though details of Dadaoglou's life are unverified.{{sfn|Moskoff|1985|p=152, 152n1}}\n\nIn 1876, an anarchist working club was founded in [[Syros]]. It played an instrumental role in the tannery and shipyard strikes of 1879.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}}\n\n[[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]], a Peloponnese city close to Patras, was another place that anarchist ideas flourished along with other socialist currents. The fight against loan sharks and the heavy taxation by the state fueled anarchist thought among small raisin producers in the Peloponnese which was the home of various anarchist groups in the late 19th century. ''New Light'' (\u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2) was a western Peloponnese weekly newspaper that voiced anarchist ideas (local and international). It was first published in October 1898 by the lawyer Vasileios Theodoridis. Its aim was to unify the subversive people of the Western Peloponnese to face the social problem. The newspaper contained articles of Drakoulis, translations of the works of Paul Argyriad\u00e8s, republications of texts that first appeared in Athenian magazines and news about the Greek and the international labour movement. It also contained adages of the Orthodox Church Fathers and [[Charles Fourier]] as well as translations of texts by Bakunin, Kropotkin and Girard. <!-- Girard is the name mentioned by Noutsos but I cant find who this person is--> {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=87-91}} The publisher of \u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 was the journalist Dimos. Papathanasiou. In a 1861 article in \u039d\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 <!--Noutsos mentions it simply as Fos not Neon Fos-->, entitled \"Anarchy as the greatest good\", he claimed that state authorities live at the expense of the people. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=130-133}} \n\nThe anarchist groups of the Peloponnese were the strongest in Greece until the early 20th century. They had a lively propaganda work in the cities and their surroundings as opposed to \"authoritarian\" socialists who were more interested in parliamentary politics. They encouraged abstention in the elections of 1899 and mobilized against loan sharks and taxation in the name of raisin producers. They did not seek the support of the state to confront the currant crisis but rather to denounce state mechanisms of oppression. {{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=90-91}}\n\nZestful socialist [[Stavros Kallergis]] was arguing in ''The Socialist'' (a newspaper he was editing) that socialism is the path towards Anarchism. ''The Socialist'' was funnelling the contemporary socialist thought of Europe, ranging from moderate socialist to anarchist opinions, during the 1890s.{{sfn|Noutsos|1995|pp=68-70}}\n\nPersecution against anarchists intensified in the summer of 1894. The assassination of [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] by an anarchist led to a barrage of attacks against the anarchists by the press, and in particular by Asty, the official organ of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]' party. Many anarchists and socialists were put on trial and this led others to either flee the country or relocate in isolated parts of Greece. Similarly, many radical publications closed down and mainstream activity was reduced. <ref>{{cite book |last=\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03cc\u03b6\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 |first= \u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2|date= 2013|title=\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7 \u2212 \u03a8\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2|url=https://www.academia.edu/3717626|location=Athens |publisher=\u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 |page= 35\u201337|isbn= |author-link=}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1896 in Patras, Dimitrios Matsalis, a sandal maker, murdered Dionysios Fragkopoulos, a banker and currant merchant and injured Andreas Kollas. He declared that \"I acted alone. By killing I did not aim at people but I stroke the capital. I am an anarchist and as an anarchist I am in favour of violence.\" He committed suicide in prison.

In this period, Greek anarchism broke away from its anarcho-syndicalist origins, and it was organized around small direct action groups. Students played a significant role in this new phase. {{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} Students returning from Paris, where they had taken part in the [[May 68|events of May 1968]] and got in touch with leftist and anarchist ideas, started spreading these ideas among the radical youth. In 1972, [[Guy Debord]]'s ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' was published in Athens, along with other [[Situationist]] texts. Mikhail Bakunin's ''[[God and the State]]'' and [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''Law and Authority'' followed. The \"Black Rose\" bookshop carried these publications of \"Diethnis Vivliothiki\" (\"International Library\").{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=110}} Interest in anarchism swelled with the anti-junta movement, and the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] was a flashpoint for the junta's opposition.{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} The group that initiated the Polytechnic uprising included a minority of anarchists and leftists, who sought the fall of capitalism in addition to the group's common aim: the reinstatement of democracy.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Anarchists were branded as ''provocateurs'' by the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] as they were expressing slogans not directly related to the student's demands (i.e. they were calling for sexual freedom, social revolution and the abolition of the State). The resonance with the French 1968 movement was clear. {{sfn|Kornetis|2013|pp=260}} Some demonstrators also used slogans with anarchist overtones, such as \"Down with Authority\" and \"People Revolt\".{{sfn|Vradis|Dalakoglou|2009}} The uprising became an emboldening symbol for the anarchists and leftists' unfulfilled vision, as if the occupation never ended.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The uprising is commemorated annually with a multi-day march.

The government's reaction to the occupation made the oppression against anarchists almost unbearable,{{how?|date=September 2019}} but the anarchist movement survived and staged demonstrations with thousands of participants in Athens.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=113-15}} In retaliation against Melistas,{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} the [[17 November Group]] killed  Nikolaos Georgakopoulos and injured fourteen other [[Units_for_the_Reinstatement_of_Order|MAT]] officers in a 1985 bus bombing.{{sfn|Marinos|2010}}{{sfn|Kiesling|2014|pp=137-149}}\n\nThe anarchists proposal was in contrast to the legalistic approach of The Greek Communist Party (KKE), which was enjoying by then parliamentary participation.{{sfn|Apoifis|2014|p=112-13}}{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=72}} Exarcheia was increasingly becoming a no go zone for police as clashes occurred merely with the sight of officers.{{sfn|van der Steen|2014|pp=73}}\n\nAlternative media and punk subcultures proliferated anarchist thought among Greek youth in the 1980s and 1990s. This collectively owned media spread messages against [[neoliberalism]], [[reactionary populism]], [[liberal democracy]], and [[the state]].{{sfn|Siapera|Theodosiadis|2017|p=508}} By the late 1980s, anarchism had turned towards a broader spectrum of issues: gender inequalities, patriarchy, racism towards immigrants, and ethnic minority repression (Slavic and Turkish).

After leaving Oasis in 2009, he formed and became the lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist for [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].\n\nGallagher began playing guitar at the age of 13, and became a roadie and technician for [[Inspiral Carpets]] at the age of 21. He learned that his brother [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] had formed a band called The Rain, which eventually became Oasis, and Liam invited him to join them as the lead guitarist. He agreed on condition that he would write their material. The band's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), was a critical and commercial success. Their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. [[Britpop]] eventually declined in popularity and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following an altercation with Liam, Noel announced his departure from Oasis and formed High Flying Birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/48012 |title=Noel Gallagher confirms solo career plan &#124; News |work=NME |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, with whom he has released three studio albums.\n\nOasis' time was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which Noel was involved in several disputes with Liam and their fights and wild lifestyles regularly made tabloid headlines. The band notably had a rivalry with fellow Britpop band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Noel himself was often regarded as the spearhead of the Britpop movement, with ''[[NME]]'' deeming several Britpop bands (including [[Kula Shaker]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], and [[Cast (band)|Cast]]) \"Noelrock\".<ref name=\"Kessler, Ted 1996\">Kessler, Ted. \"Noelrock!\" ''NME''. 8 June 1996.</ref> Many have praised his songwriting, with [[The Beatles|Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]] calling him \"the finest songwriter of his generation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=801 |title=Time Flies \u2013 1994\u20132009 |work=Oasisnet |accessdate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414101646/http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=801 |archivedate=14 April 2010 }}</ref> Conversely, he was voted the most overrated guitarist of the last millennium in a 1999 poll,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12203950.Gallagher_and_the_Spice_Girls_have_little_to_celebrate_after_a_bad_day_at_the_polls_Discord_on_the_first_Noel/|title=Gallagher and the Spice Girls have little to celebrate after a bad day at the polls Discord on the first Noel|date=6 December 1999|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref> and the ninth most overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Edward|date=23 April 2002|title=Clapton rocked by guitar poll finding|journal=[[The Scotsman]]|quote=Fans polled by the music magazine ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' [...] Most over-rated: 1.

He would play his favourite songs from the radio, and was particularly inspired by the debut of [[the Smiths]] on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1983, performing their single \"[[This Charming Man]]\". He later said that, from that day on, he \"wanted to be [[Johnny Marr]]\".<ref>Harris, pg. 120</ref> He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester [[Gaelic football]] team [[CLG Ois\u00edn]] at [[Croke Park]] in [[Dublin]] in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/noel-gallagher-claims-he-scored-a-point-in-croke-park-as-a-teenager-301941|title=Noel Gallagher Tells Of How He Scored A Point In Croke Park As A Teenager|first=Conor|last=Neville|website=Balls.ie}}</ref>\n\nAs teenagers, the Gallagher brothers maintained limited contact with their father and secured jobs in construction. However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said, \"Because we were always arguing, we'd still be working at nine o'clock every night.\"<ref name=\"britpop119\" /> Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to [[British Gas]]. He sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, he was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise the guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' in this storehouse, including \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\". He later called the storehouse \"The Hit Hut\" and claimed the walls were painted gold.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time by using recreational drugs, writing songs, and playing the guitar. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.<ref>This is cited at many sources, including an interview with VH1's Behind the Music (2000), [[Russell Brand]] on ''[[1 Leicester Square]]'' (2006) and ''Oasis: In Their Own Words'' (1996)</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Gallagher met guitarist Graham Lambert of [[Inspiral Carpets]] during a [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]] show. The two became acquainted and Gallagher became a regular at Inspiral Carpets shows. When he heard singer Steve Holt was leaving the band, he auditioned to be the new vocalist.<ref name=\"britpop121\">Harris, pg. 121</ref> He was unsuccessful, but became part of the band's road crew for the next two years.

He attended one of their concerts at Manchester's Boardwalk but was unimpressed by the group's act. After rejecting an offer from Liam to be the band's manager,<ref>Interview with [[Frank Skinner]], ''The Frank Skinner Show'', 2000</ref> Gallagher agreed to join the band, on the condition that he would take creative control of the group and become its sole songwriter. According to another source, Gallagher told Liam and the rest of the group after having heard them play for the first time: \"Let me write your songs and I'll take you to superstardom, or else you'll rot here in Manchester\". His control over the band in its early years earned him the nickname \"The Chief\".<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book | author=Robertson, Ian | title=Oasis: What's the Story? | publisher=Blake Books | year=1996 | isbn=0-7119-5695-2}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1993, the band heard that a record executive from [[Creation Records]] would be scouting for talent at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut|King Tut's]] in Glasgow. Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had been added to the bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder [[Alan McGee]].<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;128\u201329</ref>\n\nMcGee then took the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape to Sony America and invited Oasis to meet with him a week later in London, at which point they were signed to a six-album contract. Gallagher has since claimed that he only had six songs written at the time, and has put his success in the interview down to \"bullshitting\".<ref name=VH1/> However, McGee believes that when they met, Gallagher had fifty or so songs written, and merely lied about how prolific he had been following the contract.<ref name=\"dvd\" /> [[Richard Ashcroft]] was so impressed with Oasis during the time, that he invited them to tour with his band [[the Verve]] as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/37.shtml |title=Bittersweet Triumph |publisher=Musicsaves.org |accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nGallagher claimed to have written Oasis' first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", in \"the time it takes to play the song.\"<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video | people=Carruthers, Dick (Director) | date=2004 | title=Definitely Maybe  | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477053/ | medium=VHS/DVD | publisher=Sony}}</ref> \"Supersonic\" was released in early 1994 and peaked at No. 31 on the official UK charts.

It was during this time that Gallagher wrote \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" as a \"thank you\" for the girl he stayed with, who \"talked him from off the ledge\". He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot, and during a trip by the pair to Las Vegas, Gallagher decided to continue with the band. He reconciled with his brother and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref>\n\nGallagher followed up the debut in 1995 with Oasis' first UK number-one single in \"[[Some Might Say]]\". This preceded their second album, ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', released later that year. Though it suffered initial critical apathy, the album became the second fastest-selling album ever in the UK, entering the UK album charts at number one and peaking at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"wts1\" />\n\nThe success of Oasis and his newfound fame and fortune were not lost on Gallagher, and both he and his brother became famous for their \"rock and roll lifestyle\". They drank heavily, abused drugs, fought fans, critics, peers, and each other, and made celebrity friends such as [[Ian Brown]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[Gary Mournfield|Mani]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Craig Cash]], [[Kate Moss]] and [[Johnny Depp]].

Originally, Noel had wanted to take lead vocals on \"Wonderwall\", but Liam insisted on singing it. As compensation, Noel decided he would sing lead vocals on \"Don't Look Back in Anger\".<ref>Interview at ''[[Soccer AM]]'' (Sky Sports 1), 11 September 2004</ref> 1995 also saw Gallagher play two songs for the charity album ''[[The Help Album|Help!]]'': \"Fade Away\", accompanied by friend and Oasis fan Johnny Depp and Depp's then-girlfriend Kate Moss; and the Beatles' 1969 hit \"[[Come Together]]\", along with Paul Weller, [[Paul McCartney]] and others in a [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] called Smokin' Mojo Filters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warchildmusic.com/helpbytrack.asp|title=The Help Album: Track By Track|publisher=[[War Child (charity)|War Child]]|accessdate=18 February 2008}}</ref> He began collaborating with the [[Chemical Brothers]], [[Ian Brown]], [[the Stands]], [[the Prodigy]] and Weller, amongst others. Gallagher became so influential that a June 1996 ''NME'' article argued that \"If Noel Gallagher, the most successful songwriter of his generation, champions a group, then said group are guaranteed more mainstream kudos and, quite possibly, more sales. And since Noel has taken to championing only five or six groups, then it's a powerful cabal he's promoting.\"<ref name=\"Kessler, Ted 1996\"/> The ''NME'' article grouped the bands Gallagher praised, including [[the Boo Radleys]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], and [[Cast (band)|Cast]], under the banner of \"[[Noelrock]]\". John Harris typified these bands, and Gallagher, of \"sharing a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock's most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of 'real music'\".<ref>Harris, pg. 296</ref>\n\nIn March 1996, Gallagher and his brother Liam met their father again when the ''[[News of the World]]'' paid him to go to their hotel during a tour. He left for his room, later commenting \"as far as I'm concerned, I haven't got a father. He's not a father to me, y'know? I don't respect him in any way whatsoever\".<ref name=VH1/> In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the worldwide success of ''Morning Glory?'', ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997) became Oasis' most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album failed to live up to long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards ''Be Here Now'' was short-lived.<ref>Cavanagh, David (2000). ''The Creation Records Story: My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize''.

Passion Pictures, 2004.</ref> While the album was a recordbreaker, selling 813,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album's popularity, saying: \"Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good.

His depression and paranoia inspired the song \"Gas Panic!\", subsequently included on the 2000 album ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]''. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, \"I liked drugs, I was good at them. But I'd had panic attacks for about a year and I stopped because I wanted to.

In 1997, Gallagher was criticised for attending a high-profile and well-publicised media party at [[10 Downing Street]], hosted by the new Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], along with other celebrities and industry figures who had supported [[British Labour party|New Labour]] in the run-up to the general election.

''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' included a further three tracks by Liam (including \"[[Songbird (Oasis song)|Songbird]]\"), one by [[Gem Archer]], and one by [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]. The album ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' featured another three tracks by Liam (one of them, \"Love Like a Bomb\", co-written with Archer), one from Archer, and two from Bell.

Both groups played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 [[BRIT Awards]] by singing a rendition of \"[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]\" when they collected their \"Best British Band\" award, with Liam changing the lyrics to \"shite-life\".\n\nGallagher maintains that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine ''NME'' and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that he has had no respect for either party ever since.

Although their relationship had stabilised in later years, there were a handful of incidents during the band's early career where the two came to blows. At a Los Angeles show during their first American tour in 1994, Liam took to changing the words of the songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. A confrontation after the show which led to a chair being thrown and a brawl breaking out caused Noel to leave the tour and head for Las Vegas, and he later claimed he had \"visions of ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|Fear and Loathing]]'' flashing in [his] eyes\". During recording sessions for ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', the brothers had a violent fight involving a cricket bat when Liam invited everyone from a local pub into the studio while Noel was trying to work.<ref>''Definitely Maybe'' DVD Interview.</ref> In 1995, Noel sang \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' when Liam failed to turn up.<ref name=Later20111125>{{Cite episode |title=Later&nbsp;... with Jools Holland |episodelink=Later... with Jools Holland |network=BBC Two |airdate=2 December 1995 |series=06 |number=05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Noel provided lead vocals at a performance for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' when Liam backed out minutes before the set was due to start. Liam claimed to have been struck down with a \"sore throat\", but the band later found out that Liam did not like performing acoustically.<ref name=VH1/> Noel was further angered when Liam proceeded to heckle him from the balcony and \"nurse his sore throat\" with beer and cigarettes while the band performed. Just before the band were about to board a plane to the United States for an important make-or-break tour, Liam left the airport, claiming he had to find a house for his then-wife [[Patsy Kensit]]. He later joined the band for their last few gigs and the infamous [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Awards]] performance, while the remaining dates were scrapped. The band's future was daily tabloid news.\n\nWhile on tour in [[Barcelona]] in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when Alan White's arm seized up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. Liam made a derogatory comment about Gallagher's then-wife [[Meg Mathews]] and attempted to cast doubt over the legitimacy of his daughter Ana\u00efs, causing Noel to headbutt him. Following this, he declared he was quitting overseas touring, but returned for an Oasis gig in [[Dublin]] on 8 July 2000.

From there it grew into this crap that I was [[Soapbox|standing on an orange crate]] at [[Speakers' Corner]] saying, \"Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?\" I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, \"Chicken sandwiches in [[McDonald's]] are just plain fucking wrong,\" it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in [[Tokyo]]. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in [[Chris Martin]]. [...] I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the [[Def Jam]] tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] were awesome.

You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it.\" When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with, he said, \"Anyone.

In an interview that year, when he was asked about why he visited Blair, he replied:\n\n{{cquote|I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway.

After leaving Oasis in 2009, he formed and became the lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist for [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].\n\nGallagher began playing guitar at the age of 13, and became a roadie and technician for [[Inspiral Carpets]] at the age of 21. He learned that his brother [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] had formed a band called The Rain, which eventually became Oasis, and Liam invited him to join them as the lead guitarist. He agreed on condition that he would write their material. The band's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), was a critical and commercial success. Their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. [[Britpop]] eventually declined in popularity and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following an altercation with Liam, Noel announced his departure from Oasis and formed High Flying Birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/48012 |title=Noel Gallagher confirms solo career plan &#124; News |work=NME |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, with whom he has released three studio albums.\n\nOasis' time was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which Noel was involved in several disputes with Liam and their fights and wild lifestyles regularly made tabloid headlines. The band notably had a rivalry with fellow Britpop band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Noel himself was often regarded as the spearhead of the Britpop movement, with ''[[NME]]'' deeming several Britpop bands (including [[Kula Shaker]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], and [[Cast (band)|Cast]]) \"Noelrock\".<ref name=\"Kessler, Ted 1996\">Kessler, Ted. \"Noelrock!\" ''NME''. 8 June 1996.</ref> Many have praised his songwriting, with [[The Beatles|Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]] calling him \"the finest songwriter of his generation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=801 |title=Time Flies \u2013 1994\u20132009 |work=Oasisnet |accessdate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414101646/http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=801 |archivedate=14 April 2010 }}</ref> Conversely, he was voted the most overrated guitarist of the last millennium in a 1999 poll,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12203950.Gallagher_and_the_Spice_Girls_have_little_to_celebrate_after_a_bad_day_at_the_polls_Discord_on_the_first_Noel/|title=Gallagher and the Spice Girls have little to celebrate after a bad day at the polls Discord on the first Noel|date=6 December 1999|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref> and the ninth most overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Edward|date=23 April 2002|title=Clapton rocked by guitar poll finding|journal=[[The Scotsman]]|quote=Fans polled by the music magazine ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' [...] Most over-rated: 1.

He would play his favourite songs from the radio, and was particularly inspired by the debut of [[the Smiths]] on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1983, performing their single \"[[This Charming Man]]\". He later said that, from that day on, he \"wanted to be [[Johnny Marr]]\".<ref>Harris, pg. 120</ref> He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester [[Gaelic football]] team [[CLG Ois\u00edn]] at [[Croke Park]] in [[Dublin]] in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/noel-gallagher-claims-he-scored-a-point-in-croke-park-as-a-teenager-301941|title=Noel Gallagher Tells Of How He Scored A Point In Croke Park As A Teenager|first=Conor|last=Neville|website=Balls.ie}}</ref>\n\nAs teenagers, the Gallagher brothers maintained limited contact with their father and secured jobs in construction. However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said, \"Because we were always arguing, we'd still be working at nine o'clock every night.\"<ref name=\"britpop119\" /> Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to [[British Gas]]. He sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, he was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise the guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' in this storehouse, including \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\". He later called the storehouse \"The Hit Hut\" and claimed the walls were painted gold.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time by using recreational drugs, writing songs, and playing the guitar. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.<ref>This is cited at many sources, including an interview with VH1's Behind the Music (2000), [[Russell Brand]] on ''[[1 Leicester Square]]'' (2006) and ''Oasis: In Their Own Words'' (1996)</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Gallagher met guitarist Graham Lambert of [[Inspiral Carpets]] during a [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]] show. The two became acquainted and Gallagher became a regular at Inspiral Carpets shows. When he heard singer Steve Holt was leaving the band, he auditioned to be the new vocalist.<ref name=\"britpop121\">Harris, pg. 121</ref> He was unsuccessful, but became part of the band's road crew for the next two years. He struck up a friendship with monitor engineer Mark Coyle over their love of [[the Beatles]], and the pair spent soundchecks dissecting the group's songs.<ref name=\"britpop123\">Harris, pg. 123</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Oasis===\nIn 1991, Gallagher returned from an American tour with the Inspiral Carpets to find that his brother Liam had become a singer with a local band called [[The Rain (Manchester band)|the Rain]]. He attended one of their concerts at Manchester's Boardwalk but was unimpressed by the group's act. After rejecting an offer from Liam to be the band's manager,<ref>Interview with [[Frank Skinner]], ''The Frank Skinner Show'', 2000</ref> Gallagher agreed to join the band, on the condition that he would take creative control of the group and become its sole songwriter. According to another source, Gallagher told Liam and the rest of the group after having heard them play for the first time: \"Let me write your songs and I'll take you to superstardom, or else you'll rot here in Manchester\". His control over the band in its early years earned him the nickname \"The Chief\".<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book | author=Robertson, Ian | title=Oasis: What's the Story? | publisher=Blake Books | year=1996 | isbn=0-7119-5695-2}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1993, the band heard that a record executive from [[Creation Records]] would be scouting for talent at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut|King Tut's]] in Glasgow. Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had been added to the bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder [[Alan McGee]].<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;128\u201329</ref>\n\nMcGee then took the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape to Sony America and invited Oasis to meet with him a week later in London, at which point they were signed to a six-album contract. Gallagher has since claimed that he only had six songs written at the time, and has put his success in the interview down to \"bullshitting\".<ref name=VH1/> However, McGee believes that when they met, Gallagher had fifty or so songs written, and merely lied about how prolific he had been following the contract.<ref name=\"dvd\" /> [[Richard Ashcroft]] was so impressed with Oasis during the time, that he invited them to tour with his band [[the Verve]] as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/37.shtml |title=Bittersweet Triumph |publisher=Musicsaves.org |accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nGallagher claimed to have written Oasis' first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", in \"the time it takes to play the song.\"<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video | people=Carruthers, Dick (Director) | date=2004 | title=Definitely Maybe  | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477053/ | medium=VHS/DVD | publisher=Sony}}</ref> \"Supersonic\" was released in early 1994 and peaked at No. 31 on the official UK charts.

The conditions were poor, and he felt the American audience\u2014still preoccupied with [[grunge]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]]\u2014did not understand the band.<ref name=\"ownwords\"/> Gallagher stated that his early songs, especially \"Live Forever\", were written to refute grunge's pessimism.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2415 |title=The Greatest Songs Ever!

It was during this time that Gallagher wrote \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" as a \"thank you\" for the girl he stayed with, who \"talked him from off the ledge\". He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot, and during a trip by the pair to Las Vegas, Gallagher decided to continue with the band. He reconciled with his brother and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref>\n\nGallagher followed up the debut in 1995 with Oasis' first UK number-one single in \"[[Some Might Say]]\". This preceded their second album, ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', released later that year. Though it suffered initial critical apathy, the album became the second fastest-selling album ever in the UK, entering the UK album charts at number one and peaking at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"wts1\" />\n\nThe success of Oasis and his newfound fame and fortune were not lost on Gallagher, and both he and his brother became famous for their \"rock and roll lifestyle\". They drank heavily, abused drugs, fought fans, critics, peers, and each other, and made celebrity friends such as [[Ian Brown]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[Gary Mournfield|Mani]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Craig Cash]], [[Kate Moss]] and [[Johnny Depp]].

Originally, Noel had wanted to take lead vocals on \"Wonderwall\", but Liam insisted on singing it. As compensation, Noel decided he would sing lead vocals on \"Don't Look Back in Anger\".<ref>Interview at ''[[Soccer AM]]'' (Sky Sports 1), 11 September 2004</ref> 1995 also saw Gallagher play two songs for the charity album ''[[The Help Album|Help!]]'': \"Fade Away\", accompanied by friend and Oasis fan Johnny Depp and Depp's then-girlfriend Kate Moss; and the Beatles' 1969 hit \"[[Come Together]]\", along with Paul Weller, [[Paul McCartney]] and others in a [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] called Smokin' Mojo Filters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warchildmusic.com/helpbytrack.asp|title=The Help Album: Track By Track|publisher=[[War Child (charity)|War Child]]|accessdate=18 February 2008}}</ref> He began collaborating with the [[Chemical Brothers]], [[Ian Brown]], [[the Stands]], [[the Prodigy]] and Weller, amongst others. Gallagher became so influential that a June 1996 ''NME'' article argued that \"If Noel Gallagher, the most successful songwriter of his generation, champions a group, then said group are guaranteed more mainstream kudos and, quite possibly, more sales. And since Noel has taken to championing only five or six groups, then it's a powerful cabal he's promoting.\"<ref name=\"Kessler, Ted 1996\"/> The ''NME'' article grouped the bands Gallagher praised, including [[the Boo Radleys]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], and [[Cast (band)|Cast]], under the banner of \"[[Noelrock]]\". John Harris typified these bands, and Gallagher, of \"sharing a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock's most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of 'real music'\".<ref>Harris, pg. 296</ref>\n\nIn March 1996, Gallagher and his brother Liam met their father again when the ''[[News of the World]]'' paid him to go to their hotel during a tour. He left for his room, later commenting \"as far as I'm concerned, I haven't got a father. He's not a father to me, y'know? I don't respect him in any way whatsoever\".<ref name=VH1/> In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the worldwide success of ''Morning Glory?'', ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997) became Oasis' most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album failed to live up to long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards ''Be Here Now'' was short-lived.<ref>Cavanagh, David (2000). ''The Creation Records Story: My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize''. (London) Virgin Books</ref> The album was ultimately regarded by many as a bloated, over-indulgent version of Oasis, which Gallagher has since blamed on the drug-addicted state and indifference of the band at the time.<ref name=liveforever>''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop''. Passion Pictures, 2004.</ref> While the album was a recordbreaker, selling 813,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album's popularity, saying: \"Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good.

His depression and paranoia inspired the song \"Gas Panic!\", subsequently included on the 2000 album ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]''. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, \"I liked drugs, I was good at them. But I'd had panic attacks for about a year and I stopped because I wanted to. After you make the decision, it is quite easy.\" Of the period between 1993 and 1998, Gallagher claims, \"I can hardly remember a thing.\"<ref name=\"ownwords\">{{cite book | author=St. Michael, Mick | title=Oasis: In Their Own Words | publisher=Omnibus Pr | year=1996 | isbn=0-7119-5695-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Noel Gallagher.jpg|thumb|Gallagher performing with Oasis at the [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]] on 11 September 2005]]\nAfter the hype surrounding the release of ''Be Here Now'' had started to wane, critical response to the band became calmer and more considered, leading to a media backlash. In 1997, Gallagher was criticised for attending a high-profile and well-publicised media party at [[10 Downing Street]], hosted by the new Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], along with other celebrities and industry figures who had supported [[British Labour party|New Labour]] in the run-up to the general election.

''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' included a further three tracks by Liam (including \"[[Songbird (Oasis song)|Songbird]]\"), one by [[Gem Archer]], and one by [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]. The album ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' featured another three tracks by Liam (one of them, \"Love Like a Bomb\", co-written with Archer), one from Archer, and two from Bell.

Both groups played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 [[BRIT Awards]] by singing a rendition of \"[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]\" when they collected their \"Best British Band\" award, with Liam changing the lyrics to \"shite-life\".\n\nGallagher maintains that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine ''NME'' and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that he has had no respect for either party ever since.

Although their relationship had stabilised in later years, there were a handful of incidents during the band's early career where the two came to blows. At a Los Angeles show during their first American tour in 1994, Liam took to changing the words of the songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. A confrontation after the show which led to a chair being thrown and a brawl breaking out caused Noel to leave the tour and head for Las Vegas, and he later claimed he had \"visions of ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|Fear and Loathing]]'' flashing in [his] eyes\". During recording sessions for ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', the brothers had a violent fight involving a cricket bat when Liam invited everyone from a local pub into the studio while Noel was trying to work.<ref>''Definitely Maybe'' DVD Interview.</ref> In 1995, Noel sang \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' when Liam failed to turn up.<ref name=Later20111125>{{Cite episode |title=Later&nbsp;... with Jools Holland |episodelink=Later... with Jools Holland |network=BBC Two |airdate=2 December 1995 |series=06 |number=05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Noel provided lead vocals at a performance for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' when Liam backed out minutes before the set was due to start. Liam claimed to have been struck down with a \"sore throat\", but the band later found out that Liam did not like performing acoustically.<ref name=VH1/> Noel was further angered when Liam proceeded to heckle him from the balcony and \"nurse his sore throat\" with beer and cigarettes while the band performed. Just before the band were about to board a plane to the United States for an important make-or-break tour, Liam left the airport, claiming he had to find a house for his then-wife [[Patsy Kensit]]. He later joined the band for their last few gigs and the infamous [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Awards]] performance, while the remaining dates were scrapped. The band's future was daily tabloid news.\n\nWhile on tour in [[Barcelona]] in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when Alan White's arm seized up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. Liam made a derogatory comment about Gallagher's then-wife [[Meg Mathews]] and attempted to cast doubt over the legitimacy of his daughter Ana\u00efs, causing Noel to headbutt him. Following this, he declared he was quitting overseas touring, but returned for an Oasis gig in [[Dublin]] on 8 July 2000.

From there it grew into this crap that I was [[Soapbox|standing on an orange crate]] at [[Speakers' Corner]] saying, \"Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?\" I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, \"Chicken sandwiches in [[McDonald's]] are just plain fucking wrong,\" it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in [[Tokyo]]. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in [[Chris Martin]]. [...] I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the [[Def Jam]] tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] were awesome.

You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it.\" When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with, he said, \"Anyone.

In an interview that year, when he was asked about why he visited Blair, he replied:\n\n{{cquote|I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway.

The story pits two of literature's most iconic anti-heroes against each other: [[Captain Nemo]] and [[Captain Ahab]]. Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.

The story pits two of literature's most iconic anti-heroes against each other: [[Captain Nemo]] and [[Captain Ahab]]. Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.
