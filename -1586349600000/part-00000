There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea.

They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium).

The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense)\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 (recognised in 1949), and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom. [[Suriname]] followed in 1975. After the war the Netherlands left behind an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the [[Benelux]], the [[NATO]], [[Euratom]] and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would evolve into the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] ([[Common Market]]) and later the [[European Union]].\n\nGovernment-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce [[population density]] prompted some 500,000 [[Dutch people]] to leave the country after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409956/Netherlands |title=Netherlands |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarisation]] characterized by the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines.

In 2002, the [[euro]] was introduced as [[fiat money]] and in 2010, the [[Netherlands Antilles]] was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]].

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}} of outer sea-dikes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|0}} of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province.

In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands. The islands are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and have land and maritime borders with [[France]] ([[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]), maritime borders with France ([[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]]), the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Anguilla]]), [[Venezuela]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and the [[United States]] ([[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/hydrography/contents/maritime-zones-and-boundaries/maritime-boundaries-of-the-caribbean-part-of-the-kingdom|title=Maritime boundaries of the Caribbean part of the Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kleine Bonaire-Underwater life(js).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Underwater life of [[Klein Bonaire]]]]\nWithin this island group:\n* [[Bonaire]] is part of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] within the [[Leeward Antilles]] island chain off the [[Venezuela]]n coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.\n* [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] are part of the [[SSS islands]]. They are located east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to [[hurricanes]].\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Den Haag - panoramio - Nikolai Karaneschev.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]], where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet]]\nThe Netherlands has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1815, and due to the efforts of [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]],<ref name=NRC>{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> became a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s.jpg\n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017. The [[Korps Commandotroepen]], the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.<ref>[http://www.korpscommandotroepen.nl/index.php?l=nl&p=118 KCT.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union.

According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968.

Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous, was the age of the \"Dutch Masters\", such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. All of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands since he studied at [[Leiden University]] \u2014 as did throughout the centuries geologist [[James Hutton]], British Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]].

Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n\n[[File:Anouk, ESC2013 press conference 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] in 2013]]\n[[File:Coldplay perform \"Up&Up\", Amsterdam Arena, June 2016 (5).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Johan Cruyff Arena]], the largest Dutch concert venue]]\nContemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.\n\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[ReVamp]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], [[Asrai]], [[Autumn]], [[Ayreon]] and [[Within Temptation]] as well as [[jazz]] and pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having international success. Also, metal bands like [[Hail of Bullets]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Izegrim]], [[Asphyx]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]], [[Present Danger]], [[Heidevolk]] and [[Slechtvalk]] are popular guests at the biggest [[metal festival]]s in Europe.

Tracks like \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s, Dutch [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]].

Their most recent win was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]].\n\nIn [[classical music]], [[Jan Sweelinck]] ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with [[Louis Andriessen]] amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. [[Ton Koopman]] is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are [[Janine Jansen]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Rieu]]. The latter, together with his [[Johann Strauss Orchestra]], has taken classical and [[waltz (music)|waltz music]] on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts.

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events.

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced [[feudalism]] and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]] was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.<ref>To this day the Dutch Royal family is in fact the wealthiest family of the Netherlands.

However, their expansion into [[India]] was halted, after their defeat in the [[Battle of Colachel]] by the [[Travancore|Kingdom of Travancore]], during the [[Travancore-Dutch War]].

In 2013, it ranked fourth on the human development index.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Terminology of the Low Countries}}\n\nThe Netherlands' turbulent history and shifts of power resulted in exceptionally many and widely varying names in different languages. There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea.

They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium).

The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense)\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 (recognised in 1949), and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom. [[Suriname]] followed in 1975. After the war the Netherlands left behind an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the [[Benelux]], the [[NATO]], [[Euratom]] and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would evolve into the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] ([[Common Market]]) and later the [[European Union]].\n\nGovernment-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce [[population density]] prompted some 500,000 [[Dutch people]] to leave the country after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409956/Netherlands |title=Netherlands |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarisation]] characterized by the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines.

In 2002, the [[euro]] was introduced as [[fiat money]] and in 2010, the [[Netherlands Antilles]] was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]].

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}} of outer sea-dikes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|0}} of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province.

In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands. The islands are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and have land and maritime borders with [[France]] ([[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]), maritime borders with France ([[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]]), the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Anguilla]]), [[Venezuela]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and the [[United States]] ([[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/hydrography/contents/maritime-zones-and-boundaries/maritime-boundaries-of-the-caribbean-part-of-the-kingdom|title=Maritime boundaries of the Caribbean part of the Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kleine Bonaire-Underwater life(js).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Underwater life of [[Klein Bonaire]]]]\nWithin this island group:\n* [[Bonaire]] is part of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] within the [[Leeward Antilles]] island chain off the [[Venezuela]]n coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.\n* [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] are part of the [[SSS islands]]. They are located east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to [[hurricanes]].\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Den Haag - panoramio - Nikolai Karaneschev.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]], where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet]]\nThe Netherlands has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1815, and due to the efforts of [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]],<ref name=NRC>{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> became a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s.jpg\n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017. The [[Korps Commandotroepen]], the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.<ref>[http://www.korpscommandotroepen.nl/index.php?l=nl&p=118 KCT.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union.

According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968.

Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous, was the age of the \"Dutch Masters\", such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. All of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands since he studied at [[Leiden University]] \u2014 as did throughout the centuries geologist [[James Hutton]], British Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]].

Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n\n[[File:Anouk, ESC2013 press conference 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] in 2013]]\n[[File:Coldplay perform \"Up&Up\", Amsterdam Arena, June 2016 (5).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Johan Cruyff Arena]], the largest Dutch concert venue]]\nContemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.\n\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[ReVamp]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], [[Asrai]], [[Autumn]], [[Ayreon]] and [[Within Temptation]] as well as [[jazz]] and pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having international success. Also, metal bands like [[Hail of Bullets]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Izegrim]], [[Asphyx]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]], [[Present Danger]], [[Heidevolk]] and [[Slechtvalk]] are popular guests at the biggest [[metal festival]]s in Europe.

Tracks like \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s, Dutch [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]].

Their most recent win was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]].\n\nIn [[classical music]], [[Jan Sweelinck]] ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with [[Louis Andriessen]] amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. [[Ton Koopman]] is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are [[Janine Jansen]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Rieu]]. The latter, together with his [[Johann Strauss Orchestra]], has taken classical and [[waltz (music)|waltz music]] on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts.

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events.

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. The paper said it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi's segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his paper route until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip.

In his first term Barry had made a point of insisting that any firm wishing to do business with the city have minority partners, and shepherding legislation requiring 35% of all contracts to go to minority-owned firms. The policy was modified in his second term such that the administration gave contracts to Barry's political connections and high-end campaign contributors to the tune of $856 million.<ref name=blackent /> The city did not exercise sufficient oversight. The cost of services such as heating oil for the public schools inflated 40 percent, without any guarantee that the goods and services were being provided. City councilman [[John A.

By this time, his dominance of city politics was so absolute that he faced only token opposition in the Democratic primary in the form of former school board member Mattie Taylor, whom Barry dispatched rather easily. Barry had expected to face Jesse Jackson, who had been encouraged by colleagues to seek the mayoralty, and who had been relatively popular in stark contrast to Barry's declining reputation. Barry, who knew that most of Jackson's income came from delivering speeches, used his political clout to arbitrarily disqualify Jackson by getting a law passed that said anyone who made more than a certain amount in [[Honorarium|honoraria]] was ineligible to run for D.C. office.

In his first term Barry had made a point of insisting that any firm wishing to do business with the city have minority partners, and shepherding legislation requiring 35% of all contracts to go to minority-owned firms. The policy was modified in his second term such that the administration gave contracts to Barry's political connections and high-end campaign contributors to the tune of $856 million.<ref name=blackent /> The city did not exercise sufficient oversight. The cost of services such as heating oil for the public schools inflated 40 percent, without any guarantee that the goods and services were being provided. City councilman [[John A.

Several of his associates were indicted for financial malfeasance, including former administration officials Ivanhoe Donaldson and Alphonse G. Hill. Barry began to be plagued by rumors and press reports of womanizing and of alcohol and drug abuse; in particular, stories abounded of his cocaine use in the city's nightclubs and red-light district.

By this time, his dominance of city politics was so absolute that he faced only token opposition in the Democratic primary in the form of former school board member Mattie Taylor, whom Barry dispatched rather easily. Barry had expected to face Jesse Jackson, who had been encouraged by colleagues to seek the mayoralty, and who had been relatively popular in stark contrast to Barry's declining reputation. Barry, who knew that most of Jackson's income came from delivering speeches, used his political clout to arbitrarily disqualify Jackson by getting a law passed that said anyone who made more than a certain amount in [[Honorarium|honoraria]] was ineligible to run for D.C. office. Council members jokingly called this the \"Jesse Jackson law,\" as it was legislated expressly to keep Jackson out of the mayoral race. As expected, Barry defeated Republican city councilwoman [[Carol Schwartz]] fairly handily in the November 4 general election.

[[Frank Robinson]]'s RBI single with two on off of [[Al Worthington]] made it 6\u20132 Orioles in the sixth. Blair's two-run home run in the eighth off of [[Dean Chance]] made it 8\u20132 Orioles.
