Kirkpatrick ''Select Letters of Tipu Sultan'', London 1811</ref> and [[Mark Wilks]],<ref>M. Wilks ''Report on the Interior Administration, Resources and Expenditure of the Government of Mysore under the System prescribed by the Order of the Governor-General in Council dated 4 September 1799'', Bangalore 1864, and ''Historical Sketches of the South of India in an Attempt to Trace the History of Mysore'', 2 vols, ed.

The French were allies of Tipu Sultan. Francois Fidele Ripaud de Montaudevert, a French soldier who fought for Tippu, in his diary entry of 14 January 1799 writes: \"I'm disturbed by Tipu Sultan's treatment of these most gentle souls, the Hindus. During the siege of Mangalore, Tipu's soldiers daily exposed the heads of many innocent Brahmins within sight from the fort for the Zamorin and his Hindu followers to see.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-tyrant-diaries/284803|title=The Tyrant Diaries|author=Francois Gautier|work=www.outlookindia.com/|author-link=Francois Gautier}}</ref>\n\n====Relations with Muslims====\nDuring his campaigns of clamping down on groups that helped the British, Tipu Sultan targeted several Muslim groups, including the [[Mappila]] Muslims of Malabar, the Mahadevi Muslims, and the [[Nawab of Savanur]] and [[Nizamabad district|Nizam]].\n\n====Relations with Hindus====\n=====Hindu officers=====\nTipu Sultan's treasurer was Krishna Rao, [[Shamaiya Iyengar]] was his Minister of Post and Police, his brother Ranga Iyengar was also an officer, and [[Purnaiah|Purnaiya]] held the very important post of \"Mir Asaf\". Moolchand and Sujan Rai were his chief agents at the Mughal court, and his chief \"Peshkar\", Suba Rao, was also a Hindu.<ref name=\"Tipu Sultan pp. 357\"/>\n\n=====Regular endowments to 156 Hindu temples=====\nEditor of Mysore Gazettes spondence between his court and temples, and his having donated jewellery and deeded land grants to several temples, which he was compelled to do to make alliances with Hindu rulers. Between 1782 and 1799 Tipu Sultan issued 34 \"Sanads\" (deeds) of endowment to temples in his domain, while also presenting many of them with gifts of silver and gold plate{{cn|date=January 2020}}. The Srikanteswara Temple in Nanjangud still possesses a jeweled cup presented by the Sultan.<ref>A. Subbaraya Chetty, 2002, \"Tipu's endowments to Hindus\" in Habib.  . 111\u2013115.</ref> He also gave a greenish [[linga]]; to Ranganatha temple at Srirangapatna, he donated seven silver cups and a silver [[camphor]] burner. This temple was hardly a stone's throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the [[muezzin]]'s call from the mosque; to the [[Lakshmikanta Temple, Kalale|Lakshmikanta Temple]] at [[Kalale]] he gifted four cups, a plate and [[Spitoon]] in silver.<ref name=\"padiga3\"/><ref name=\"hasan2\"/>\n\n=====Sringeri incident, Maratha sacking, and rebuilding temple=====\nDuring the [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] in 1791, a group of [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] horsemen under Raghunath Rao Patwardhan  raided the temple and ''matha'' of [[Sringeri]] ''[[Shankaracharya]]''. They killed and wounded many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.<ref name=\"Hasan358\"/>\n\nThe incumbent ''Shankaracharya'' petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]]. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:<ref name=\"Hasan358\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA358|title=History of Tipu Sultan|author=Mohibbul Hasan|page=358|isbn=9788187879572|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bO9Ma9Sb2g4aUvIUT29fCP/Why-we-love-to-hate-Tipu-Sultan.html|title=Why we love to hate Tipu Sultan|author=Vikram Sampath|work=www.livemint.com/|date=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\"<ref>''Annual Report of the Mysore Archaeological Department'' 1916 pp&nbsp;10\u201311, 73\u20136</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of [[Bednur]] to supply the Swami with 200 ''rahati''s (''[[Travancore Fanam|fanam]]''s) in cash and other gifts and articles. Tipu Sultan's interest in the Sringeri temple continued for many years, and he was still writing to the Swami in the 1790s.<ref>Hasan, ''History of Tipu Sultan'', p. 359</ref>\n\n=====Controversial figure=====\nIn light of this and other events, historian B. A. Saletare has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu [[dharma]], who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale.<ref>B.A. Saletare \"Tipu Sultan as Defender of the Hindu Dharma\" in Habib (Ed.) ''Confronting Colonialism'', pp. 116\u20138</ref> Tipu Sultan does seem to have repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to [[Brahmin]]s and temples, but those which had proper ''sanads'' (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C. Hayavadana Rao]] wrote about Tipu in his encyclopaedic court history of Mysore. He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

The British administrator [[Mark Wilks]] gives it as 70,000, historian Lewis Rice arrives at the figure of 85,000, while Mir Kirmani's score for the Coorg campaign is 80,000 men, women and child prisoners.<ref name=\"Prabhu\"/>\n\nMohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular. Hassan says that it is difficult to estimate the real number of Coorgis captured by Tipu.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hassan|first=Mohibbul|title=History of Tipu Sultan|date=1 December 2005|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA417&dq=%22Captivity+of+Coorgs+at+Seringapatam%22#v=onepage&q=Coorgs&f=false|accessdate=12 February 2014|isbn=9788187879572}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Runmust Khan, Tipu himself stated:<ref>{{harvnb|Sen|1930|p=157}}</ref>\n{{quote|\"We proceeded with the utmost speed, and, at once, made prisoners of 40,000 occasion-seeking and sedition-exciting Coorgis, who alarmed at the approach of our victorious army, had slunk into woods, and concealed themselves in lofty mountains, inaccessible even to birds.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical. School and college textbooks in India officially recognize him as a \"freedom-fighter\" along with many other rulers of the 18th century who fought European powers{{cn|date=January 2020}}.\n\nIn 1990, a television series on him, ''[[The Sword of Tipu Sultan]]'' was directed by [[Bollywood]] actor [[Sanjay Khan]] based on a [[historical novel]] by [[Bhagwan Gidwani]].\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Gumbaz.jpg|thumb|right|The mausoleum housing Tipu's tomb is another example of [[Islamic architecture]].

These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired ''en masse'', spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder's death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} The rockets deployed by Tipu during the [[Battle of Pollilur (1780)|Battle of Pollilur]] were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2&nbsp;km range).<ref name=Narasimha/>\n\nBritish accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets.

They killed and wounded many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.<ref name=\"Hasan358\"/>\n\nThe incumbent ''Shankaracharya'' petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]]. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:<ref name=\"Hasan358\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA358|title=History of Tipu Sultan|author=Mohibbul Hasan|page=358|isbn=9788187879572|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bO9Ma9Sb2g4aUvIUT29fCP/Why-we-love-to-hate-Tipu-Sultan.html|title=Why we love to hate Tipu Sultan|author=Vikram Sampath|work=www.livemint.com/|date=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\"<ref>''Annual Report of the Mysore Archaeological Department'' 1916 pp&nbsp;10\u201311, 73\u20136</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of [[Bednur]] to supply the Swami with 200 ''rahati''s (''[[Travancore Fanam|fanam]]''s) in cash and other gifts and articles.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C.

He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and in 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/uganda/ Uganda: A Country Study]. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990. p. 4</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, by the first century CE and possibly as early as the fourth century BCE in Western Tanzania, certain related Bantu-speaking metallurgists were perfecting iron smelting to produce medium grade [[carbon steel]] in pre-heated forced-draught furnaces. Although most of these developments were taking place southwest of modern Ugandan boundaries, iron was mined and smelted in many parts of the country not long afterward.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\"/>\n\n== Uganda Protectorate (1894\u20131962) ==  \n{{Further|Uganda Protectorate}}\n\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|recruited to East Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to construct the [[Uganda Railway]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/762515.stm | title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display | publisher=[[BBC]] | last=Evans | first=Ruth | date=24 May 2000 | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | title=THE LUNATIC EXPRESS \u2013 A PHOTO ESSAY ON THE UGANDA RAILWAY. | publisher=[[Thee Agora]] | last=Chao | date=26 October 2014 | access-date=18 January 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422095958/http://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | archive-date=22 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230140/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 September 2015 | title=Policing, Colonial Life and Decolonisation in Uganda, 1957\u20131960 | publisher=The Ferguson Centre for African and Asian Studies, Working Paper No. 03 | last=West | first=Stewart | date=February 2012 | pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/4/pdfs/02-0626.pdf | title=Reanalyzing the 1900\u20131920 Sleeping Sickness Epidemic in Uganda | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | location=US | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | last1=F\u00e8vre | first1=E.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives at the hands of his regime, many of them in the north, which he associated with Obote's loyalists.<ref>{{cite news | last=Keatley | first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=The Guardian | date=18 August 2003 | accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref> Aside from his brutalities, he [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|forcibly removed]] the entrepreneurial [[Indian people|Indian]] minority from Uganda, which left the country's economy in ruins.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html \"UK Indians taking care of business\"], ''The Age'' (8 March 2006). Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system.

Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and in 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed.

Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990. p. 4</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, by the first century CE and possibly as early as the fourth century BCE in Western Tanzania, certain related Bantu-speaking metallurgists were perfecting iron smelting to produce medium grade [[carbon steel]] in pre-heated forced-draught furnaces. Although most of these developments were taking place southwest of modern Ugandan boundaries, iron was mined and smelted in many parts of the country not long afterward.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\"/>\n\n== Uganda Protectorate (1894\u20131962) ==  \n{{Further|Uganda Protectorate}}\n\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|recruited to East Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to construct the [[Uganda Railway]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/762515.stm | title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display | publisher=[[BBC]] | last=Evans | first=Ruth | date=24 May 2000 | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | title=THE LUNATIC EXPRESS \u2013 A PHOTO ESSAY ON THE UGANDA RAILWAY. | publisher=[[Thee Agora]] | last=Chao | date=26 October 2014 | access-date=18 January 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422095958/http://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | archive-date=22 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230140/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 September 2015 | title=Policing, Colonial Life and Decolonisation in Uganda, 1957\u20131960 | publisher=The Ferguson Centre for African and Asian Studies, Working Paper No. 03 | last=West | first=Stewart | date=February 2012 | pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/4/pdfs/02-0626.pdf | title=Reanalyzing the 1900\u20131920 Sleeping Sickness Epidemic in Uganda | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | location=US | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | last1=F\u00e8vre | first1=E.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule.

Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa.
