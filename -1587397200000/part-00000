After independence, [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. B. C. Roy]], the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, revamped the department to satisfy the demand for mining professionals, and the Department of Mining & Geology was reborn in 1956. On 12 February 1920, the name was changed to '''Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur'''.

The B.E. degree course was introduced during 1935\u201336 with the first batch obtaining the degree from Calcutta University in 1936. The inception of the Mechanical Engineering Department may be traced back to 1921 when a diploma course in Mechanical Engineering was started in this Institute. The first-degree course in Mechanical Engineering started in July 1930. The Department of Metallurgy started its journey at the Bengal Engineering College in the year 1939 with the introduction of a three-year degree course in Metallurgy under Calcutta University. The department is the second oldest metallurgy department in the country.\n\n=== Post-independence period ===\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning was started on the recommendation of a committee appointed by Government of West Bengal. Two new courses were started at the same time \u2013 one with a five-year degree programme in Architecture another with a two-year part-time diploma programme in Town & Regional Planning. The Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning (established in 1949) that offered the First Degree in Architecture and the First Diploma in Town Planning in INDIA. This department has produced more than 800 graduates in Architecture and more than 300 postgraduates in Town Planning in the last fifty years. Its students also founded the [[National Association of Students of Architecture]], briefly designated as NASA India, a non-political, non-profit Student Body Association for the Undergraduate Students of Architecture in India in 1957, with six other colleges.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, a 'Committee for the Development of Higher Engineering and Technical Education in Bengal' under the Chairmanship of the Director of Public Instruction recommended two plans \u2013 one 'Immediate' and the other 'Five Year Plan' for the college. The college celebrated its gala centenary function inaugurated by Dr B.C. Roy on 25 December 1956, and the concluding session was attended by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 14 January 1957. The Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering started functioning as a separate discipline of engineering in July 1968.\n\nThe college started its first Computer Centre in 1976 and a Microprocessor Laboratory in 1979. The 125th Anniversary of the college was celebrated on 11 December 1981, with the inauguration by Sri N. Sanjiva Reddy, the then President of India. The Department of Computer Science and Technology was established in 1982. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses. The formal inauguration was done on 13 March 1993, by the then [[President of India]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]].\n<ref name=TheUniversity/> School of Management Sciences (SMOS) and School of Information Technology were established in 1998 and 2000 respectively.

After independence, [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. B. C. Roy]], the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, revamped the department to satisfy the demand for mining professionals, and the Department of Mining & Geology was reborn in 1956. On 12 February 1920, the name was changed to '''Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur'''. The word Shibpur was deleted on 24 March 1921 and it became '''Bengal Engineering College'''.<ref name=\"TheUniversity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.becs.ac.in/ |title=Bengal Engineering And Science University, Shibpur \u2013 The University |work=becs.ac.in |accessdate=20 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207114639/http://www.becs.ac.in/ |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref> The Department of Electrical Engineering came into existence as a separate department from 1912. The B.E. degree course was introduced during 1935\u201336 with the first batch obtaining the degree from Calcutta University in 1936. The inception of the Mechanical Engineering Department may be traced back to 1921 when a diploma course in Mechanical Engineering was started in this Institute. The first-degree course in Mechanical Engineering started in July 1930. The Department of Metallurgy started its journey at the Bengal Engineering College in the year 1939 with the introduction of a three-year degree course in Metallurgy under Calcutta University. The department is the second oldest metallurgy department in the country.\n\n=== Post-independence period ===\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning was started on the recommendation of a committee appointed by Government of West Bengal. Two new courses were started at the same time \u2013 one with a five-year degree programme in Architecture another with a two-year part-time diploma programme in Town & Regional Planning. The Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning (established in 1949) that offered the First Degree in Architecture and the First Diploma in Town Planning in INDIA. This department has produced more than 800 graduates in Architecture and more than 300 postgraduates in Town Planning in the last fifty years. Its students also founded the [[National Association of Students of Architecture]], briefly designated as NASA India, a non-political, non-profit Student Body Association for the Undergraduate Students of Architecture in India in 1957, with six other colleges.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, a 'Committee for the Development of Higher Engineering and Technical Education in Bengal' under the Chairmanship of the Director of Public Instruction recommended two plans \u2013 one 'Immediate' and the other 'Five Year Plan' for the college. The college celebrated its gala centenary function inaugurated by Dr B.C. Roy on 25 December 1956, and the concluding session was attended by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 14 January 1957. The Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering started functioning as a separate discipline of engineering in July 1968.\n\nThe college started its first Computer Centre in 1976 and a Microprocessor Laboratory in 1979. The 125th Anniversary of the college was celebrated on 11 December 1981, with the inauguration by Sri N. Sanjiva Reddy, the then President of India. The Department of Computer Science and Technology was established in 1982. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses. The formal inauguration was done on 13 March 1993, by the then [[President of India]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]].\n<ref name=TheUniversity/> School of Management Sciences (SMOS) and School of Information Technology were established in 1998 and 2000 respectively.

After training he was shipped to England to fly in the [[91st Bomb Group]] at [[RAF Bassingbourn]].\n\nDuring Emond's first combat mission he flew as a tail gunner in the lead group. He flew as the co-pilot of the next few missions and then as pilot (the left seat) for the rest of his tour. Emond finished his tour around the middle of 1944 and was rotated back home to a base in [[Florida]].  When the war ended he elected to stay in the service and was in the Philippines in June 1946. After his allotment of missions, Emond was later offered to become a lead air trainer in Florida.  After a short stint training pilots, he decided to return to his job as a \"runner\" at the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nEmond completed over 34 missions while leading Man O War II. He received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Air Medal]] with 3 [[Oak Leaf Cluster]]s and logged 1306 hours at the controls. He is considered one of the youngest Lieutenants to pilot a Fortress.\n\nThe book entitled \"World War II Album Volume 18: Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress\" by Ray Merriam states (used by permission)\n\"1st Lt. Eugene Emond Lead Pilot for Man O War II Horsepower Limited was part of D-Day and witnessed one of the first German jets when a Me 262 A-1a flow through his formation over Germany.
