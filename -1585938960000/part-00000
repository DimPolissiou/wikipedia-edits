The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

Clarke was working under considerable pressure to meet an October deadline, so that the three windows would be built and installed for the Chapels consecration on November 5th.

Brigid is depicted alongside a [[bovine|calf]], Patrick with a [[shamrock]] in his right hand, and Columcille alongside two flying [[doves]]. The Brigid light is especially detailed and contains an angel at the top of the window, and another four hovering at its foot.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Alfred Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail of medallion), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail of medallion), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. The highlight is a large replication of the 12th century ''Cross of Crong''. Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2002-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary; or the Passion or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} Outstanding pieces include a Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals, and a violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, used on to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the Christian theme of the \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\".

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

He sought not just to contravene to the 1908 act, but to construct a chapel that was \"something more than merely sufficient...a church designed and fashioned on the same lines and on the same plan as those which their forefathers had built for their priests and missioners all over Ireland nearly a thousand years ago.\"{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} O'Connell, who became a priest in 1929 after the death of his wife, disliked the contemporary, international, approach to church building, which he described as \"machine made\", preferring a localised and uniquely Irish approach to style and form, which he sought from the most skilled available local craftsmen.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} He aspired that work on the chapel was \"carried out in Cork, by Cork labour and with materials obtained from the City or County of Cork\".{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\nO'Connell was assisted by Windle, who was then University president.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay {{sfn|NIAH|2000}} rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than a Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows.

They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Alfred Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail of medallion), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail of medallion), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. The highlight is a large replication of the 12th century ''Cross of Crong''. Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2002-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary; or the Passion or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} Outstanding pieces include a Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals, and a violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, used on to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\".

(2019): Sustainable Development Report 2019. New York: Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.<ref>http://www.sustainablesids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NGOs-leading-SDGs-Sustainable-Brands.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Competing goals ===\n\n{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}\nSome of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] can make it difficult to attain [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nContinued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global [[eco-economic decoupling]] is far higher than any country has achieved in the past.<ref name=\":15\" /> Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target [[resource]] use per capita, with \"substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations.\"<ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal | last=Hickel | first=Jason | title=The contradiction of the sustainable development goals: Growth versus ecology on a finite planet | journal=Sustainable Development | publisher=Wiley | date=2019-04-15 | issn=0968-0802 | doi=10.1002/sd.1947 | page=}}</ref>\n\n=== Too many goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as \"sprawling, misconceived\" and \"a mess\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals. In addition, Bhargava (2019) has emphasized the inter-dependence between the numerous sub-goals and the role played by population growth in developing countries in hampering their operationalization.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Weak on environmental sustainability ===\n\nEnvironmental constraints and [[planetary boundaries]] are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper \"Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wackernagel|first=Mathis|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Lin|first3=David|date=2017|title=Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2017.00018|issn=2296-598X}}</ref>\" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs ''per se'', but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 said that the SDGs are \"a mess\" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.<ref name=\":5\" /> The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development.{{Clarify|reason=What's the difference between \"development\" and \"sustainable development\"?|date=June 2019}} Finally, the MDGs used a sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nWhilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Another core feature of the SDGs is their focus on means of implementation, or the mobilization of financial resources, along with capacity building and technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Action for Climate Empowerment]]\n* [[Economics of climate change mitigation]]\n* [[Education 2030 Agenda]]\n* [[Planetary management]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals and Iran]]\n\n==Further reading==\nBhargava, A.

(2019): Sustainable Development Report 2019. New York: Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.<ref>http://www.sustainablesids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NGOs-leading-SDGs-Sustainable-Brands.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Competing goals ===\n\n{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}\nSome of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] can make it difficult to attain [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nContinued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global [[eco-economic decoupling]] is far higher than any country has achieved in the past.<ref name=\":15\" /> Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target [[resource]] use per capita, with \"substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations.\"<ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal | last=Hickel | first=Jason | title=The contradiction of the sustainable development goals: Growth versus ecology on a finite planet | journal=Sustainable Development | publisher=Wiley | date=2019-04-15 | issn=0968-0802 | doi=10.1002/sd.1947 | page=}}</ref>\n\n=== Too many goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as \"sprawling, misconceived\" and \"a mess\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals. In addition, Bhargava (2019) has emphasized the inter-dependence between the numerous sub-goals and the role played by population growth in developing countries in hampering their operationalization.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Weak on environmental sustainability ===\n\nEnvironmental constraints and [[planetary boundaries]] are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper \"Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wackernagel|first=Mathis|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Lin|first3=David|date=2017|title=Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2017.00018|issn=2296-598X}}</ref>\" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs ''per se'', but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 said that the SDGs are \"a mess\" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.<ref name=\":5\" /> The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development.{{Clarify|reason=What's the difference between \"development\" and \"sustainable development\"?|date=June 2019}} Finally, the MDGs used a sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nWhilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Another core feature of the SDGs is their focus on means of implementation, or the mobilization of financial resources, along with capacity building and technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Action for Climate Empowerment]]\n* [[Economics of climate change mitigation]]\n* [[Education 2030 Agenda]]\n* [[Planetary management]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals and Iran]]\n\n==Further reading==\nBhargava, A.

S. Ski Team Skiing''''') is a sports [[video game]] produced by [[Mattel]] and released for its [[Intellivision]] [[gaming console|video game system]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/intellivision/581779-us-ski-team-skiing|title=U.S. Ski Team Skiing for Intellivision|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> Up to six players compete individually on either a [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]] or [[slalom skiing|slalom]] course to see who can complete the course the fastest. For the game's initial release, Mattel obtained a license from the [[U. S. Ski Team]] and used its name and logo in the game's box art. In 1988, INTV Corporation released an enhanced version of the game entitled '''''Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing'''''.\n\nDuring its initial release, ''U. S. Ski Team Skiing'' was sold by [[Sears]] for its private-label version of the Intellivision console, the \"Super Video Arcade,\" without the U. S. Ski Team name or logo. Subsequent re-releases, such as on the ''Intellivision Lives'' collection, have also left the game name simply as ''Skiing''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe object of ''Skiing'' is to complete the chosen course, either downhill or slalom, in the fastest time possible. Play begins by selecting the number of players for the game. Each player will have three heats in which to post their fastest time for the course. With multiple players, players take turns in the same order for each heat. Next, the players choose from one of 15 levels of steepness for the course, with higher numbers representing steeper (and thus, faster) courses. Lastly, the players select either the downhill or the slalom course for their race.<ref name=\"SKInst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/sports/skiing.txt|title=Skiing instructions|publisher=IntellivisionLives.com|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nPlayers control their skiers by using the controller to turn them until they reach the desired direction. The skiers will accelerate down the hill automatically, based on the steepness of the course. Players may take turns gradually, or by pushing an action button they may take a turn more sharply. Pushing another action button will cause the skier to jump over obstacles on the course, such as [[mogul skiing|mogul]]s.<ref name=\"SKInst\"/>\n\nOn both courses, players must successfully pass through a number of gates on their way down the course, with gates on the downhill course spaced farther apart than those on the slalom course. Missing a gate adds a five-second penalty to a player's race time. As each player begins their race, the current fastest time is displayed at the starting line, with their final time displayed after the player crosses the finish line.<ref name=\"SKInst\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Skiing'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it received little praise but only minor criticism as well. It was described as \"nothing breathtakingly new\", and as offering \"an acceptable range of [gameplay] variations, although there is only one basic trail for each event\". The reviewers found that multiplayer tournament mode is \"equally entertaining\" as the solo-play mode, but they concluded that the game \"packs an amazing amount of detail into an easy-to-learn contest\".<ref name=kunkel81>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney Jr. |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1981 |title= Arcade Alley: A Sports Trio from Mattel |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 8|pages= 28 and 86|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|86}} In 1997, ''[[GameSpot]]'' alluded to ''Skiing'' as the best skiing video game of the past 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cool Boarders Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cool-boarders-review/1900-2547099/|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=9 February 2018|date=January 31, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing \n| image = MountainMadnessSuperProSkiing.jpg\n| caption=\n| developer = [[Realtime Associates]]\n| publisher = INTV Corporation\n| designer = Ray Kaestner<ref name=\"MM-INTVlives\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/gamepage.php?gameId=59|title=Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing|publisher=IntellivisionLives.com|access-date=2010-08-06|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015080344/http://intellivisiongames.com/gamepage.php?gameId=59|archive-date=2007-10-15|df=}}</ref>\n| released = {{vgrelease|NA|1988}}\n}}\nAfter Mattel Electronics shut down in 1984, INTV Corporation obtained the assets to the Intellivision system and continued producing games for the console.

Players are able to preview the desired course prior to selecting it. Each player can choose their own steepness level, instead of a single setting being used for all players.

The interface connects to an on-chip Test Access Port (TAP) that implements a [[State (computer science)|stateful]] protocol to access a set of test registers that present chip logic levels and device capabilities of various parts.\n\nThe Joint Test Action Group formed in 1985 to develop a method of verifying designs and testing [[printed circuit board]]s after manufacture. In 1990 the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] codified the results of the effort in IEEE Standard 1149.1-1990, entitled ''Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture''.\n\nThe JTAG standards have been extended by many semiconductor chip manufacturers with specialized variants to provide vendor-specific features.<ref>[http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/jtag-101-ieee-1149x-paper.pdf Randy Johnson, Steward Christie (Intel Corporation, 2009), ''JTAG 101\u2014IEEE 1149.x and Software Debug'']</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1980s, multi-layer circuit boards and [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) using [[ball grid array]] and similar mounting technologies were becoming standard, and connections were being made between ICs that were not available to probes.  The majority of manufacturing and field faults in circuit boards were due to poor [[solder]] joints on the boards, imperfections among board connections, or the bonds and bond wires from IC pads to pin lead frames. The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) was formed in 1985 to provide a pins-out view from one IC pad to another so these faults could be discovered.\n\nThe industry standard became an [[IEEE]] standard in 1990 as IEEE Std. 1149.1-1990<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-1990\">Copies of [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-1990_desc.html IEEE 1149.1-1990] or its 2001 update may be bought from the IEEE.</ref> after many years of initial use. In the same year, [[Intel]] released their first [[Central processing unit|processor]] with JTAG (the [[80486]]) which led to quicker industry adoption by all manufacturers.  In 1994, a supplement that contains a description of the [[boundary scan description language]] (BSDL) was added. Further refinements regarding the use of all-zeros for EXTEST, separating the use of SAMPLE from PRELOAD and better implementation for OBSERVE_ONLY cells were made and released in 2001.<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-2001\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-2001_desc.html|title=IEEE 1149.1-2001|publisher=}}</ref>   Since 1990, this standard has been adopted by [[electronics]] companies around the world. [[Boundary scan]] is now mostly synonymous with JTAG, but JTAG has essential uses beyond such manufacturing applications.\n\n=== Debugging ===\n\nAlthough JTAG's early applications targeted board level testing, here the JTAG standard was designed to assist with device, board, and system testing, [[diagnosis]], and fault isolation.  Today JTAG is used as the primary means of accessing sub-blocks of [[integrated circuit]]s, making it an essential mechanism for [[debugging]] [[embedded system]]s which might not have any other debug-capable communications channel.{{citation needed|reason=This statement claims that JTAG is of critical use for a certain application but doesn't provide any source that supports the statement.|date=October 2017}}  On most systems, JTAG-based debugging is available from the very first instruction after CPU reset, letting it assist with development of early boot software which runs before anything is set up. An [[in-circuit emulator]] (or, more correctly, a \"JTAG adapter\") uses JTAG as the transport mechanism to access on-chip [[debug]] modules inside the target [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Those modules let software developers debug the software of an [[embedded system]] directly at the machine instruction level when needed, or (more typically) in terms of high level language source code.\n\nSystem software debug support is for many software developers the main reason to be interested in JTAG. Many silicon architectures such as PowerPC, MIPS, ARM, x86  built an entire software debug, instruction tracing, and data tracing infrastructure around the basic JTAG protocol. Frequently individual silicon vendors however only implement parts of these extensions. Some examples are ARM [[CoreSight]] and [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] as well as Intel's BTS (Branch Trace Storage), LBR (Last Branch Record), and IPT (Intel Processor Trace) implementations. There are many other such silicon vendor-specific extensions that may not be documented except under [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]]. The adoption of the JTAG standard helped move JTAG-centric debugging environments away from early processor-specific designs.  Processors can normally be halted, single stepped, or let run freely.  One can set code breakpoints, both for code in RAM (often using a special machine instruction) and in ROM/flash.  Data breakpoints are often available, as is bulk data download to RAM.  Most designs have \"halt mode debugging\", but some allow debuggers to access registers and data buses without needing to halt the core being debugged.  Some toolchains can use ARM Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) modules, or equivalent implementations in other architectures to trigger debugger (or tracing) activity on complex hardware events, like a [[logic analyzer]] programmed to ignore the first seven accesses to a register from one particular subroutine.\n\nSometimes [[FPGA]] developers also use JTAG to develop debugging tools.<ref name=\"fpga\">[http://www.embeddeddesignindia.co.in/ART_8800568419_2800006_TA_d2d96055.HTM Select the right FPGA debug method] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427145744/http://www.embeddeddesignindia.co.in/ART_8800568419_2800006_TA_d2d96055.HTM |date=27 April 2010 }} presents one of the models for such tools.</ref>  The same JTAG techniques used to debug software running inside a [[CPU]] can help debug other digital design blocks inside an FPGA.  For example, custom JTAG instructions can be provided to allow reading registers built from arbitrary sets of signals inside the FPGA,  providing visibility for behaviors which are invisible to boundary scan operations.  Similarly, writing such registers could provide controllability which is not otherwise available.\n\n=== Storing firmware ===\n\nJTAG allows [[Programmer (hardware)|device programmer hardware]] to transfer data into internal non-volatile device memory (e.g. [[Complex programmable logic device|CPLDs]]). Some device programmers serve a double purpose for programming as well as debugging the device. In the case of FPGAs, volatile memory devices can also be programmed via the JTAG port, normally during development work. In addition, internal monitoring capabilities (temperature, voltage and current) may be accessible via the JTAG port.\n\nJTAG programmers are also used to write software and data into [[flash memory]].  This is usually done using data bus access like the CPU would use, and is sometimes actually handled by a CPU, but in other cases memory chips have JTAG interfaces themselves.  Some modern debug architectures provide internal and external bus master access without needing to halt and take over a CPU.  In the worst case, it is usually possible to drive external bus signals using the boundary scan facility.\n\nAs a practical matter, when developing an embedded system, emulating the instruction store is the fastest way to implement the \"debug cycle\" (edit, compile, download, test, and debug).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  This is because the in-circuit emulator simulating an instruction store can be updated very quickly from the development host via, say, USB. Using a serial UART port and bootloader to upload firmware to Flash makes this debug cycle quite slow and possibly expensive in terms of tools; installing firmware into Flash (or SRAM instead of Flash) via JTAG is an intermediate solution between these extremes.\n\n=== Boundary scan testing ===\n\nJTAG [[boundary scan]] technology provides access to many logic signals of a complex integrated circuit, including the device pins. The signals are represented in the boundary scan register (BSR) accessible via the TAP. This permits testing as well as controlling the states of the signals for testing and debugging. Therefore, both software and hardware (manufacturing) faults may be located and an operating device may be monitored.\n\nWhen combined with built-in self-test ([[Built-in self-test|BIST]]), the JTAG scan chain enables a low overhead, embedded solution to test an IC for certain static faults (shorts, opens, and logic errors).  The scan chain mechanism does not generally help diagnose or test for timing, temperature or other dynamic operational errors that may occur.  [[Test case]]s are often provided in standardized formats such as [[Serial Vector Format|SVF]], or its binary sibling XSVF, and used in production tests.  The ability to perform such testing on finished boards is an essential part of [[Design For Test]] in today's products, increasing the number of faults that can be found before products ship to customers.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n\nA JTAG interface is a special interface added to a chip. Depending on the version of JTAG, two, four, or five pins are added. The four and five pin interfaces are designed so that multiple chips on a board can have their JTAG lines [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chained]] together if specific conditions are met.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtagtest.com/faq/jtag-ieee-1149-1/under-what-conditions-can-i-daisy-chain-jtag|title=FAQ: Under what conditions can I daisy-chain JTAG?|website=www.jtagtest.com}}</ref> The two pin interface is designed so that multiple chips can be connected in a [[Star Network|star topology]]. In either case a [[test probe]] need only connect to a single \"JTAG port\" to have access to all chips on a [[circuit board]].\n\n=== Daisy-chained JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) ===\n[[Image:Jtag chain.svg|center|Example of JTAG chain. Test reset signal is not shown]]\n\nThe connector pins are:\n\n#'''TDI''' (Test Data In)\n#'''TDO''' (Test Data Out)\n#'''TCK''' (Test Clock)\n#'''TMS''' (Test Mode Select)\n#'''TRST''' (Test Reset) optional.\n\nThe TRST pin is an optional active-low reset to the test logic, usually asynchronous, but sometimes synchronous, depending on the chip. If the pin is not available, the test logic can be reset by switching to the reset state synchronously, using TCK and TMS.  Note that resetting test logic doesn't necessarily imply resetting anything else.  There are generally some processor-specific JTAG operations which can reset all or part of the chip being debugged.\n\nSince only one data line is available, the protocol is [[Serial communications|serial]]. The clock input is at the TCK pin. One bit of data is transferred in from TDI, and out to TDO per TCK rising clock edge. Different instructions can be loaded. Instructions for typical ICs might read the chip ID, sample input pins, drive (or float) output pins, manipulate chip functions, or bypass (pipe TDI to TDO to logically shorten chains of multiple chips).\n\nAs with any clocked signal, data presented to TDI must be valid for some chip-specific ''Setup'' time before and ''Hold'' time after the relevant (here, rising) clock edge. TDO data is valid for some chip-specific time after the falling edge of TCK.\n\nThe maximum operating frequency of TCK varies depending on all chips in the chain (the lowest speed must be used), but it is typically 10-100&nbsp;MHz (100-10 ns per bit).  Also TCK frequencies depend on board layout and JTAG adapter capabilities and state.  One chip might have a 40&nbsp;MHz JTAG clock, but only if it is using a 200&nbsp;MHz clock for non-JTAG operations; and it might need to use a much slower clock when it is in a low power mode.  Accordingly, some JTAG adapters have ''adaptive clocking'' using an RTCK (Return TCK) signal.  Faster TCK frequencies are most useful when JTAG is used to transfer lots of data, such as when storing a program executable into [[flash memory]].\n\nClocking changes on TMS steps through a standardized JTAG [[state machine]].  The JTAG state machine can reset, access an instruction register, or access data selected by the instruction register.\n\nJTAG platforms often add signals to the handful defined by the IEEE 1149.1 specification.  A System Reset (SRST) signal is quite common, letting debuggers reset the whole system, not just the parts with JTAG support.  Sometimes there are event signals used to trigger activity by the host or by the device being monitored through JTAG; or, perhaps, additional control lines.\n\nEven though few consumer products provide an explicit JTAG port connector, the connections are often available on the [[printed circuit board]] as a remnant from development [[prototype|prototyping]] and/or production. When exploited, these connections often provide the most viable means for [[reverse engineering]].\n\n=== Reduced pin count JTAG (IEEE 1149.7) ===\n[[File:Example of reduced pin count JTAG interface.svg|thumb|Example of JTAG with reduced pin count]]\n\nReduced pin count JTAG uses only two wires, a clock wire and a data wire. This is defined as part of the IEEE 1149.7 standard.<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\"/> The connector pins are:\n\n#'''TMSC''' (Test Serial Data)\n#'''TCKC''' (Test Clock)\n\nIt is called cJTAG for compact JTAG.\n\nThe two wire interface reduced pressure on the number of pins, and devices can be connected in a [[star topology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corelis.com/education/design-testability-tips-guidelines/major-benefits-ieee-1149-7/|title=Major Benefits of IEEE 1149.7|publisher=}}</ref> The star topology enables some parts of the system to be powered down, while others can still be accessed over JTAG; a daisy chain requires all JTAG interfaces to be powered. Other two-wire interfaces exist, such as [[#Similar interface standards|Serial Wire Debug]].\n\n== Communications model ==\n\nIn JTAG, devices expose one or more ''test access ports'' (TAPs).  The picture above shows three TAPs, which might be individual chips or might be modules inside one chip.  A daisy chain of TAPs is called a ''scan chain'', or (loosely) a target.  Scan chains can be arbitrarily long, but in practice twenty TAPs is unusually long.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nTo use JTAG, a host is connected to the target's JTAG signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, etc.) through some kind of ''JTAG adapter'', which may need to handle issues like level shifting and [[galvanic isolation]].  The adapter connects to the host using some interface such as USB, PCI, Ethernet, and so forth.\n\n=== Primitives ===\n\nThe host communicates with the TAPs by manipulating TMS and TDI in conjunction with TCK, and reading results through TDO (which is the only standard host-side input). TMS/TDI/TCK output transitions create the basic JTAG communication primitive on which higher layer protocols build:\n\n* ''State switching'' ... All TAPs are in the same state, and that state changes on TCK transitions.  This JTAG state machine is part of the JTAG spec, and includes sixteen states.  There are six \"stable states\" where keeping TMS stable prevents the state from changing.  In all other states, TCK always changes that state.  In addition, asserting TRST forces entry to one of those stable states (Test_Logic_Reset), in a slightly quicker way than the alternative of holding TMS high and cycling TCK five times.\n* ''Shifting'' ... Most parts of the JTAG state machine support two stable states used to transfer data.  Each TAP has an ''instruction register'' (IR) and a ''data register'' (DR).  The size of those registers varies between TAPs, and those registers are combined through TDI and TDO to form a large shift register.  (The size of the DR is a function of the value in that TAP's current IR, and possibly of the value specified by a SCAN_N instruction.) There are three operations defined on that shift register:\n** ''Capturing'' a temporary value\n*** Entry to the ''Shift_IR'' stable state goes via the Capture_IR state, loading the shift register with a partially fixed value (not the current instruction)\n*** Entry to the ''Shift_DR'' stable state goes via the Capture_DR state, loading the value of the Data Register specified by the TAP's current IR.\n** ''Shifting'' that value bit-by-bit, in either the Shift_IR or Shift_DR stable state; TCK transitions shift the shift register one bit, from TDI towards TDO, exactly like a [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] mode 1 data transfer through a daisy chain of devices (with TMS=0 acting like the chip select signal, TDI as MOSI, etc.).\n** ''Updating'' IR or DR from the temporary value shifted in, on transition through the Update_IR or Update_DR state.  Note that it is not possible to read (capture) a register without writing (updating) it, and vice versa.  A common idiom adds flag bits to say whether the update should have side effects, or whether the hardware is ready to execute such side effects.\n* ''Running'' ... One stable state is called Run_Test/Idle.  The distinction is TAP-specific.  Clocking TCK in the Idle state has no particular side effects, but clocking it in the Run_Test state may change system state.  For example, some [[ARM9]] cores support a debugging mode where TCK cycles in the Run_Test state drive the instruction pipeline.\n\nSo at a basic level, using JTAG involves reading and writing instructions and their associated data registers; and sometimes involves running a number of test cycles.  Behind those registers is hardware that is not specified by JTAG, and which has its own states that is affected by JTAG activities.\n\nMost JTAG hosts use the shortest path between two states, perhaps constrained by quirks of the adapter.  (For example, one adapter{{Which|date=March 2010}} only handles paths whose lengths are multiples of seven bits.)  Some layers built on top of JTAG monitor the state transitions, and use uncommon paths to trigger higher level operations.  Some ARM cores use such sequences to enter and exit a two-wire (non-JTAG) [[Serial Wire Debug|SWD]] mode.  A Zero Bit Scan (ZBS) sequence is used in IEEE 1149.7<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\">Texas Instruments is one adopter behind this standard, and has an [http://tiexpressdsp.com/wiki/index.php?title=IEEE_1149.7 IEEE 1149.7 wiki page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406214032/http://tiexpressdsp.com/wiki/index.php?title=IEEE_1149.7 |date=6 April 2014 }} with more information.</ref> to access advanced functionality such as switching TAPs into and out of scan chains, power management, and a different two-wire mode.\n\n=== JTAG IEEE Std 1149.1 (boundary scan) instructions ===\n\nInstruction register sizes tend to be small, perhaps four or seven bits wide.  Except for BYPASS and EXTEST, all instruction opcodes are defined by the TAP implementor, as are their associated data registers; undefined instruction codes should not be used.  Two key instructions are:\n\n* The BYPASS instruction, an opcode of all ones regardless of the TAP's instruction register size, must be supported by all TAPs.  The instruction selects a single bit data register (also called BYPASS).  The instruction allows this device to be bypassed (do nothing) while other devices in the scan path are exercised.<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-2001\" />\n* The optional IDCODE instruction, with an implementor-defined opcode.  IDCODE is associated with a 32-bit register (IDCODE).  Its data uses a standardized format that includes a manufacturer code (derived from the [[JEDEC]] ''Standard Manufacturer's Identification Code'' standard, JEP-106), a part number assigned by the manufacturer, and a part version code.  IDCODE is widely, but not universally, supported.\n\nOn exit from the RESET state, the instruction register is preloaded with either BYPASS or IDCODE.  This allows JTAG hosts to identify the size and, at least partially, contents of the scan chain to which they are connected.  (They can enter the RESET state then scan the Data Register until they read back the data they wrote.  A BYPASS register has only a zero bit; while an IDCODE register is 32-bits and starts with a one.  So the bits not written by the host can easily be mapped to TAPs.)  Such identification is often used to sanity check manual configuration, since IDCODE is often unspecific.  It could for example identify an ARM Cortex-M3 based microcontroller, without specifying the microcontroller vendor or model; or a particular FPGA, but not how it has been programmed.\n\nA common idiom involves shifting BYPASS into the instruction registers of all TAPs except one, which receives some other instruction.  That way all TAPs except one expose a single bit data register, and values can be selectively shifted into or out of that one TAP's data register without affecting any other TAP.\n\nThe IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) standard describes a number of instructions to support boundary scan applications.  Some of these instructions are \"mandatory\", but TAPs used for debug instead of boundary scan testing sometimes provide minimal or no support for these instructions.  Those \"mandatory\" instructions operate on the Boundary Scan Register (BSR) defined in the [[boundary scan description language|BSDL]] file, and include:\n\n* EXTEST for external testing, such as using pins to probe board-level behaviors\n* PRELOAD loading pin output values before EXTEST (sometimes combined with SAMPLE)\n* SAMPLE reading pin values into the boundary scan register\n\nIEEE-defined \"Optional\" instructions include:\n* CLAMP a variant of BYPASS which drives the output pins using the PRELOADed values\n* HIGHZ deactivates the outputs of all pins\n* INTEST for internal testing, such as using pins to probe on-chip behaviors\n* RUNBIST places the chip in a self-test mode\n* USERCODE returns a user-defined code, for example to identify which FPGA image is active\n\nDevices may define more instructions, and those definitions should be part of a BSDL file provided by the manufacturer.  They are often only marked as PRIVATE.\n\n=== Boundary scan register ===\n\nDevices communicate to the world via a set of input and output pins. By themselves, these pins provide limited visibility into the workings of the device. However, devices that support [[boundary scan]] contain a shift-register cell for each signal pin of the device. These registers are connected in a dedicated path around the device's boundary (hence the name). The path creates a virtual access capability that circumvents the normal inputs and outputs, providing direct control of the device and detailed visibility for signals.<ref name=\"oshana\">{{cite news\n | first = Rob\n | last = Oshana\n | url = http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/beginner-s-corner/4024466/Introduction-to-JTAG\n | title = Introduction to JTAG\n | work = Embedded Systems Design\n | date = 29 October 2002\n | accessdate =5 April 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nThe contents of the boundary scan register, including signal I/O capabilities, are usually described by the manufacturer using a part-specific [[boundary scan description language|BSDL]] file.  These are used with design 'netlists' from CAD/EDA systems to develop tests used in board manufacturing.  Commercial test systems often cost several thousand dollars for a complete system, and  include diagnostic options to pinpoint faults such as open circuits and shorts.  They may also offer schematic or layout viewers to depict the fault in a graphical manner.\n\nTo enable boundary scanning, IC vendors add logic to each of their devices, including scan cells for each of the signal pins. These cells are then connected together to form the boundary scan shift register (BSR), which is connected to a TAP controller. These designs are parts of most Verilog or VHDL libraries.  Overhead for this additional logic is minimal, and generally is well worth the price to enable efficient testing at the board level.\n\n== Example: ARM11 debug TAP ==\n\nAn example helps show the operation of JTAG in real systems.  The example here is the debug TAP of an [[ARM11]] processor, the ARM1136<ref name=\"ARM1136\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0211k/DDI0211K_arm1136_r1p5_trm.pdf ARM1136JF-S and ARM1136J-S Technical Reference Manual] revision r1p5, ARM DDI 0211K.  Chapter 14 presents the Debug TAP.  Other ARM11 cores present the same model through their Debug TAPs.</ref> core.  The processor itself has extensive JTAG capability, similar to what is found in other CPU cores, and it is integrated into chips with even more extensive capabilities accessed through JTAG.\n\nThis is a non-trivial example, which is representative of a significant cross section of JTAG-enabled systems.  In addition, it shows how control mechanisms are built using JTAG's register read/write primitives, and how those combine to facilitate testing and debugging complex logic elements; [[CPU]]s are common, but [[FPGA]]s and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s include other complex elements which need to be debugged.\n\nLicensees of this core integrate it into chips, usually combining it with other TAPs as well as numerous peripherals and memory.  One of those other TAPs handles boundary scan testing for the whole chip; it is not supported by the debug TAP.  Examples of such chips include:\n\n* The [[Texas Instruments OMAP|OMAP2420]], which includes a boundary scan TAP, the ARM1136 Debug TAP, an ETB11 trace buffer TAP, a [[Texas Instruments TMS320|C55x DSP]], and a TAP for an [[ARM7]] TDMI-based imaging engine, with the boundary scan TAP (\"ICEpick-B\") having the ability to splice TAPs into and out of the JTAG scan chain.<ref name=\"omap2420\">Documentation for the OMAP2420 is not publicly available.  However, a [[Texas Instruments]] document [http://wiki.davincidsp.com/images/9/90/Dbjtag_users_guide.pdf The User's Guide to DBGJTAG] discussing a JTAG diagnostic tool presents this OMAP2420 scan chain example (and others).</ref>\n* The [[i.MX31]] processor, which is similar, although its \"System JTAG\" boundary scan TAP,<ref name=\"iMX31\">See \"i.MX35 (MCIMX35) Multimedia Applications Processor Reference Manual\" from the [[Freescale]] web site.  Chapter 44 presents its \"Secure JTAG Controller\" (SJC).</ref> which is very different from ICEpick, and it includes a TAP for its DMA engine instead of a DSP and imaging engine.\n\nThose processors are both intended for use in wireless handsets such as cell phones, which is part of the reason they include TAP controllers which modify the JTAG scan chain:  Debugging low power operation requires accessing chips when they are largely powered off, and thus when not all TAPs are operational.  That scan chain modification is one subject of a forthcoming IEEE 1149.7<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\"/> standard.\n\n=== JTAG facilities ===\n\nThis debug TAP exposes several standard instructions, and a few specifically designed for hardware-assisted [[debugging]], where a software tool (the \"debugger\") uses JTAG to communicate with a system being debugged:\n\n* <code>BYPASS</code> and <code>IDCODE</code>, standard instructions as described above\n* <code>EXTEST</code>, <code>INTEST</code>, standard instructions, but operating on the core instead of an external boundary scan chain.  <code>EXTEST</code> is nominally for writing data to the core, <code>INTEST</code> is nominally for reading it; but two scan chains are exceptions to that rule.\n* <code>SCAN_N</code> ARM instruction to select the numbered scan chain used with <code>EXTEST</code> or <code>INTEST</code>.  There are six scan chains:\n** <code>0</code> - Device ID Register, 40 bits of read-only identification data\n** <code>1</code> - Debug Status and Control Register (DSCR), 32 bits used to operate the debug facilities\n** <code>4</code> - Instruction Transfer Register (ITR), 33 bits (32 instruction plus one status bit) used to execute processor instructions while in a special \"Debug Mode\" (see below)\n** <code>5</code> - Debug Communications Channel (DCC), 34 bits (one long data word plus two status bits) used for bidirectional data transfer to the core.  This is used both in debug mode, and possibly at runtime when talking to debugger-aware software.\n** <code>6</code> - Embedded Trace Module (ETM), 40 bits (7 bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to control the operation of a passive instruction and data trace mechanism.  This feeds either an on-chip Embedded Trace Buffer (ETB), or an external high speed trace data collection pod.  Tracing supports passive debugging (examining execution history) and profiling for performance tuning.\n** <code>7</code> - debug module, 40 bits (7 bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to access hardware breakpoints, watchpoints, and more.  These can be written while the processor is running; it does not need to be in Debug Mode.\n* <code>HALT</code> and <code>RESTART</code>, ARM11-specific instructions to halt and restart the CPU.  Halting it puts the core into the \"Debug Mode\", where the ITR can be used to execute instructions, including using the DCC to transfer data between the debug (JTAG) host and the CPU.\n* <code>ITRSEL</code>, ARM11-specific instruction to accelerate some operations with ITR.\nThat model resembles the model used in other ARM cores.  Non-ARM systems generally have similar capabilities, perhaps implemented using the [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] protocols on top of JTAG, or other vendor-specific schemes.\n\nOlder [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]] cores include an ''EmbeddedICE'' module<ref name=\"arm9ejs\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0222b/DDI0222.pdf ARM9EJ-S Technical Reference Manual] revision r1p2.  Appendix B \"Debug in Depth\" presents the EmbeddedICE-RT module, as seen in the popular ARM926ejs core.</ref> which combines most of those facilities, but has an awkward mechanism for instruction execution:  the debugger must drive the CPU instruction pipeline, clock by clock, and directly access the data buses to read and write data to the CPU.  The ARM11 uses the same model for trace support (ETM, ETB) as those older cores.\n\nNewer ARM Cortex cores closely resemble this debug model, but build on a ''Debug Access Port'' (DAP) instead of direct CPU access.  In this architecture (named ''CoreSight Technology''), core and JTAG module is completely independent.  They are also decoupled from JTAG so they can be hosted over ARM's two-wire '''SWD''' interface (see below) instead of just the six-wire JTAG interface.  (ARM takes the four standard JTAG signals and adds the optional TRST, plus the RTCK signal used for adaptive clocking.) The CoreSight JTAG-DP is asynchronous to the core clocks, and does not implement RTCK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/Chdhbbjd.html#Chdihede|title=CoreSight Components Technical Reference Manual: 2.3.2.\u00a0Implementation specific details|website=infocenter.arm.com}}</ref>  Also, the newer cores have updated trace support.\n\n=== Halt mode debugging ===\n\nOne basic way to debug software is to present a single threaded model, where the debugger periodically stops execution of the program and examines its state as exposed by register contents and memory (including peripheral controller registers).  When interesting program events approach, a person may want to single step instructions (or lines of source code) to watch how a particular misbehavior happens.\n\nSo for example a JTAG host might HALT the core, entering Debug Mode, and then read CPU registers using ITR and DCC.  After saving processor state, it could write those registers with whatever values it needs, then execute arbitrary algorithms on the CPU, accessing memory and peripherals to help characterize the system state.  After the debugger performs those operations, the state may be restored and execution continued using the RESTART instruction.\n\nDebug mode is also entered asynchronously by the debug module triggering a watchpoint or breakpoint, or by issuing a BKPT (breakpoint) instruction from the software being debugged.  When it is not being used for instruction tracing, the ETM can also trigger entry to debug mode; it supports complex triggers sensitive to state and history, as well as the simple address comparisons exposed by the debug module.  Asynchronous transitions to debug mode are detected  by polling the DSCR register.  This is how single stepping is implemented:  HALT the core, set a temporary breakpoint at the next instruction or next high-level statement, RESTART, poll DSCR until you detect  asynchronous entry to debug state, remove that temporary breakpoint, repeat.\n\n=== Monitor mode debugging ===\n\nModern software is often too complex to work well with such a single threaded model.  For example, a processor used to control a motor (perhaps one driving a saw blade) may not be able to safely enter halt mode; it may need to continue handling interrupts to ensure physical safety of people and/or machinery.  Issuing a HALT instruction using JTAG might be dangerous.\n\nARM processors support an alternative debug mode, called ''Monitor Mode'', to work with such situations.  (This is distinct from the ''Secure Monitor Mode'' implemented as part of security extensions on newer ARM cores; it manages debug operations, not security transitions.)  In those cases, breakpoints and watchpoints trigger a special kind of hardware exception, transferring control to a \"debug monitor\" running as part of the system software.  This monitor communicates with the debugger using the DCC, and could arrange for example to single step only a single process while other processes (and interrupt handlers) continue running.\n\n== Common extensions ==\n\nMicroprocessor vendors have often defined their own core-specific debugging extensions.  Such vendors include [[Infineon]], MIPS with EJTAG, and more.  If the vendor does not adopt a standard (such as the ones used by ARM processors; or Nexus), they need to define their own solution.  If they support boundary scan, they generally build debugging over JTAG.\n\n[[Freescale]] has COP and OnCE (On-Chip Emulation). OnCE includes a JTAG command which makes a TAP enter a special mode where the IR holds OnCE debugging commands<ref name=\"OnCE\">AN1817/D, \"MMC20xx M\u2022CORE OnCE Port Communication and Control Sequences\"; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; 2004.  Not all processors support the same OnCE module.</ref> for operations such as single stepping, breakpointing, and accessing registers or memory.  It also defines EOnCE (Enhanced On-Chip Emulation)<ref name=\"EOnCE\">AN2073 \"Differences Between the EOnCE and OnCE Ports\"; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; 2005.</ref> presented as addressing real time concerns.\n\n[[ARM architecture|ARM]] has an extensive processor core debug architecture (CoreSight) that started with EmbeddedICE (a debug facility available on most ARM cores), and now includes many additional components such as an ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell), with a high speed trace port, supporting multi-core and multithread tracing.  Note that tracing is non-invasive; systems do not need to stop operating to be traced.  (However, trace data is too voluminous to use JTAG as more than a trace control channel.)\n\n[[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] defines a processor debug infrastructure which is largely vendor-independent.  One of its hardware interfaces is JTAG.  It also defines a high speed auxiliary port interface, used for tracing and more.  Nexus is used with some newer platforms, such as the [[Atmel]] AVR32 and Freescale MPC5500 series processors.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n* Except for some of the very lowest end systems, essentially all [[embedded systems]] platforms have a JTAG port to support in-circuit debugging and firmware programming as well as for boundary scan testing:\n** [[ARM architecture]] processors come with JTAG support, sometimes supporting a two-wire \"SWD\" variant or high speed tracing of traffic on instruction or data busses.\n** Modern 8-bit and 16-bit [[microcontroller]] chips, such as [[Atmel AVR]] and [[TI MSP430]] chips, support JTAG programming and debugging.  However, the very smallest chips may not have enough pins to spare (and thus tend to rely on proprietary single-wire programming interfaces); if the pin count is over 32, there is probably a JTAG option.\n** Almost all [[FPGA]]s and [[CPLD]]s used today can be programmed via a JTAG port. A [[Standard Test and Programming Language]] is defined by JEDEC standard JESD-71 for JTAG programming of PLD's.\n** Many [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[PowerPC]] processors have JTAG support\n** Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, and Quark processors all support JTAG probe mode with Intel specific extensions of JTAG using the so-called 60-pin eXtended Debug Port [XDP]. Additionally the Quark processor supports more traditional 10-pin connectors.\n** Consumer products such as networking appliances and [[satellite television]] [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s often use microprocessors which support JTAG, providing an alternate means to reload [[firmware]] if the existing [[bootloader]] has been corrupted in some manner.\n*The [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus connector standard contains optional JTAG signals on pins 1-5;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm#4.10|title=PCI Local Bus Technical Summary, 4.10 JTAG/Boundary Scan Pins|publisher=|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107201536/http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm#4.10|archive-date=7 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[PCI Express]] contains JTAG signals on pins 5-9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_PCI_Express_16x_PinOut.html|title=Serial PCI Express Bus 16x Pinout and PCIe Pin out Signal names|website=www.interfacebus.com}}</ref> A special JTAG card can be used to reflash a corrupt [[BIOS]].\n* Boundary scan testing and in-system (device) programming applications are sometimes programmed using the [[Serial Vector Format]], a textual representation of JTAG operations using a simple syntax. Other programming formats include 'JAM' and STAPL plus more recently the IEEE Std. 1532 defined format 'ISC' (short for In-System Configuration). ISC format is used in conjunction with enhanced BSDL models for programmable logic devices (i.e. FPGAs and CPLDs) that include addition ISC_<operation> instructions in addition to the basic bare minimum IEEE 1149.1 instructions. FPGA programming tools from [[Xilinx]], Altera, Lattice, Cypress, Actel, etc. typically are able to export such files.\n* As mentioned, many boards include JTAG connectors, or just pads, to support manufacturing operations, where boundary scan testing helps verify board quality (identifying bad solder joints, etc.) and to initialize [[flash memory]] or FPGAs.\n* JTAG can also support field updates and troubleshooting.\n\n== Client support ==\n\nThe target's JTAG interface is accessed using some JTAG-enabled application and some JTAG adapter hardware.  There is a wide range of such hardware, optimized for purposes such as production testing, debugging high speed systems, low cost microcontroller development, and so on.  In the same way, the software used to drive such hardware can be quite varied.  Software developers mostly use JTAG for debugging and updating firmware.\n\n=== Connectors ===\n[[Image:Netgear ProSafe Dual WAN VPN Gigabit Firewall FVS336G JTAG interface.jpeg|thumb|right|A [[Netgear]] FVS336G [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] with a 14 pin JTAG header at lower left.]]\n[[Image:ADSL modem router internals labeled.jpg|thumb|right|A Netgear DG632 [[ADSL modem]] with an 8 pin JTAG header at location \"5\".]]\n\nThere are no official standards for JTAG adapter physical connectors.  Development boards usually include a header to support preferred development tools; in some cases they include multiple such headers, because they need to support multiple such tools.  For example, a microcontroller, FPGA, and ARM application processor rarely share tools, so a development board using all of those components might have three or more headers.  Production boards may omit the headers, or when space is limited may provide JTAG signal access using test points.\n\nSome common pinouts<ref>[http://www.jtagtest.com/pinouts/ JTAG Pinouts] lists a few JTAG-only header layouts that have widespread tool support.</ref> for {{convert|2.54|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[pin header]]s are:\n\n* ARM 2\u00d710 pin (or sometimes the older 2\u00d77), used by almost all ARM based systems\n* MIPS EJTAG (2\u00d77 pin) used for [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] based systems\n* 2\u00d75 pin [[Altera]] ByteBlaster-compatible JTAG extended by many vendors\n* 2\u00d75 pin [[Atmel AVR|AVR]] extends Altera JTAG with SRST (and in some cases TRST and an event output)\n* 2\u00d77 pin [[Texas Instruments]] used with [[Texas Instruments TMS320|DSPs]] and ARM-based products such as [[OMAP]]\n* 8 pin (single row) generic PLD JTAG compatible with many Lattice ispDOWNLOAD cables\n* [[MIPI Debug Architecture|MIPI]]10-/20-connectors (1.27&nbsp;mm 050\") for JTAG, cJTAG and SWD\n\nThose connectors tend to include more than just the four standardized signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO).  Usually reset signals are provided, one or both of TRST (TAP reset) and SRST (system reset).  The connector usually provides the board-under-test's logic supply voltage so that the JTAG adapters use the appropriate logic levels<!-- eg 5, 3.3, ..., 1V, ... -->. The board voltage may also serve as a \"board present\" debugger input.  Other event input or output signals may be provided, or [[General Purpose Input/Output|general purpose I/O]] (GPIO) lines, to support more complex debugging architectures.\n\nHigher end products frequently use dense connectors (frequently 38-pin [[MICTOR]] connectors) to support high-speed [[Tracing (software)|tracing]] in conjunction with JTAG operations.  A recent trend is to have development boards integrate a USB interface to JTAG, where a second channel is used for a serial port.  (Smaller boards can also be powered through USB.  Since modern PCs tend to omit serial ports, such integrated debug links can significantly reduce clutter for developers.)  Production boards often rely on [[Bed of nails tester|bed-of-nails]] connections to test points for testing and programming.\n\n=== Adapter hardware ===\nAdapter hardware varies widely.  When not integrated into a development board, it involves a short cable to attach to a JTAG connector on the target board; a connection to the debugging host, such as a USB, PCI, or Ethernet link; and enough electronics to adapt the two communications domains (and sometimes provide [[galvanic isolation]]).  A separate power supply may be needed. There are both \"dumb\" adapters, where the host decides and performs all JTAG operations; and \"smart\" ones, where some of that work is performed inside the adapter, often driven by a microcontroller.  The \"smart\" adapters eliminate link latencies for operation sequences that may involve polling for status changes between steps, and may accordingly offer faster throughput.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, adapters with a [[USB]] link from the host are the most common approach.  Higher end products often support [[Ethernet]], with the advantage that the debug host can be quite remote.  Adapters which support high speed trace ports generally include several megabytes of trace buffer and provide high speed links (USB or Ethernet) to get that data to the host.\n\n[[Parallel port]] adapters are simple and inexpensive, but they are relatively slow because they use the host CPU to change each bit (\"[[bit banging]]\"). They have declined in usefulness because most computers in recent years don't have a parallel port.  Driver support is also a problem, because pin usage by adapters varied widely.  Since the parallel port is based on 5V logic level, most adapters lacked voltage translation support for 3.3V or 1.8V target voltages.\n\nRS-232 [[serial port]] adapters also exist, and are similarly declining in usefulness.  They generally involve either slower bit banging than a parallel port, or a microcontroller translating some command protocol to JTAG operations.  Such serial adapters are also not fast, but their command protocols could generally be reused on top of higher speed links.\n\nWith all JTAG adapters, software support is a basic concern.  Many vendors do not publish the protocols used by their JTAG adapter hardware, limiting their customers to the tool chains supported by those vendors.  This is a particular issue for \"smart\" adapters, some of which embed significant amounts of knowledge about how to interact with specific CPUs.\n\n=== Software development ===\n\nMost development environments for embedded software include JTAG support.  There are, broadly speaking, three sources of such software:\n\n* ''Chip Vendors'' may provide the tools, usually requiring a JTAG adapter they supply.  Examples include FPGA vendors such as [[Xilinx]] and [[Altera]], [[Atmel]] for its AVR8 and AVR32 product lines, and [[Texas Instruments]] for most of its DSP and micro products.  Such tools tend to be highly featured, and may be the only real option for highly specialized chips like FPGAs and DSPs.  Lower end software tools may be provided free of charge.  The JTAG adapters themselves are not free, although sometimes they are bundled with development boards.\n* ''Tool Vendors'' may supply them, usually in conjunction with multiple chip vendors to provide cross-platform development support.  [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based products have a particularly rich third party market, and a number of those vendors have expanded to non-ARM platforms like [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[PowerPC]].  Tool vendors sometimes build products around free software like [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[GNU Debugger|GDB]], with GUI support frequently using [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].  JTAG adapters are sometimes sold along with support bundles.\n* ''Open Source'' tools exist.  As noted above, GCC and GDB form the core of a good toolchain, and there are GUI environments to support them.\n\nAll such software tends to include basic debugger support:  stopping, halting, single stepping, breakpoints, data structure browsing, and so on.\nCommercial tools tend to provide tools like very accurate simulators and trace analysis, which are not currently available as open source.\n\n== {{anchor|Serial_Wire_Debug}} Similar interface standards ==\n\n''Serial Wire Debug'' (SWD) is an alternative 2-pin electrical interface that uses the same protocol. It uses the existing GND connection.  SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ihi0031c/index.html|title=ARM Information Center|website=infocenter.arm.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}</ref>  This enables the debugger to become another [[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]] bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers. Data rate is up to  {{nowrap|4 Mbytes/sec}} {{nowrap|at 50 MHz}}. SWD also has built-in error detection.  On JTAG devices with SWD capability, the TMS and TCK are used as SWDIO and SWCLK signals, providing for dual-mode programmers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Automated optical inspection]]\n* [[Automated x-ray inspection]]\n* [[In-circuit test]]\n* [[Acceptance testing]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5412866 IEEE Standard for Reduced-Pin and Enhanced-Functionality Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture] The official IEEE 1149.7 Standard.\n* [http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/jtag-101-ieee-1149x-paper.pdf JTAG 101 - IEEE 1149.x and Software Debug] Intel whitepaper on JTAG usage in system software debug across a wide range of architectures.\n* [http://www.ti.com/lit/an/ssya002c/ssya002c.pdf IEEE Std 1149.1 (JTAG) Testability Primer] Includes a strong technical presentation about JTAG, with design-for-test chapters.\n* [https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/test-methods/boundary-scan-jtag-ieee1149/what-is-boundary-scan-jtag.php Boundary Scan / IEEE 1149 tutorial] including details of variants of the IEEE standard, BSDL, DFT, and other topics\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/JTAG_Tutorial.htm JTAG Tutorial] Useful tutorials and information on JTAG technology.\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/What-Is-JTAG.htm What is JTAG?] Useful information on JTAG, timeline, architecture and more.\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/JTAG-Applications.htm JTAG Applications] JTAG for product development, life cycle, testing, tools needed, and other topics.\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n{{Microcontrollers}}\n\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[Category:IEEE standards]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Hardware testing]]\n[[Category:Printed circuit board manufacturing]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the Xbox 360 hardware modification|Homebrew (video games)#Xbox 360}}\n'''JTAG''' (named after the '''Joint Test Action Group''' which codified it) is an [[Technical standard|industry standard]] for verifying designs and testing [[printed circuit board]]s after manufacture.\n\nJTAG implements standards for on-chip instrumentation in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) as a complementary tool to [[logic simulation|digital simulation]].<ref name=stollon>{{cite book|author=Neal Stollon|title=On-Chip Instrumentation|publisher=Springer|year=2011}}</ref> It specifies the use of a dedicated debug port implementing a [[serial communication]]s interface for low-overhead access without requiring direct external access to the system address and data buses. The interface connects to an on-chip Test Access Port (TAP) that implements a [[State (computer science)|stateful]] protocol to access a set of test registers that present chip logic levels and device capabilities of various parts.\n\nThe Joint Test Action Group formed in 1985 to develop a method of verifying designs and testing [[printed circuit board]]s after manufacture. In 1990 the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] codified the results of the effort in IEEE Standard 1149.1-1990, entitled ''Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture''.\n\nThe JTAG standards have been extended by many semiconductor chip manufacturers with specialized variants to provide vendor-specific features.<ref>[http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/jtag-101-ieee-1149x-paper.pdf Randy Johnson, Steward Christie (Intel Corporation, 2009), ''JTAG 101\u2014IEEE 1149.x and Software Debug'']</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1980s, multi-layer circuit boards and [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) using [[ball grid array]] and similar mounting technologies were becoming standard, and connections were being made between ICs that were not available to probes.  The majority of manufacturing and field faults in circuit boards were due to poor [[solder]] joints on the boards, imperfections among board connections, or the bonds and bond wires from IC pads to pin lead frames. The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) was formed in 1985 to provide a pins-out view from one IC pad to another so these faults could be discovered.\n\nThe industry standard became an [[IEEE]] standard in 1990 as IEEE Std. 1149.1-1990<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-1990\">Copies of [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-1990_desc.html IEEE 1149.1-1990] or its 2001 update may be bought from the IEEE.</ref> after many years of initial use. In the same year, [[Intel]] released their first [[Central processing unit|processor]] with JTAG (the [[80486]]) which led to quicker industry adoption by all manufacturers.  In 1994, a supplement that contains a description of the [[boundary scan description language]] (BSDL) was added. Further refinements regarding the use of all-zeros for EXTEST, separating the use of SAMPLE from PRELOAD and better implementation for OBSERVE_ONLY cells were made and released in 2001.<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-2001\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-2001_desc.html|title=IEEE 1149.1-2001|publisher=}}</ref>   Since 1990, this standard has been adopted by [[electronics]] companies around the world. [[Boundary scan]] is now mostly synonymous with JTAG, but JTAG has essential uses beyond such manufacturing applications.\n\n=== Debugging ===\n\nAlthough JTAG's early applications targeted board level testing, here the JTAG standard was designed to assist with device, board, and system testing, [[diagnosis]], and fault isolation.  Today JTAG is used as the primary means of accessing sub-blocks of [[integrated circuit]]s, making it an essential mechanism for [[debugging]] [[embedded system]]s which might not have any other debug-capable communications channel.{{citation needed|reason=This statement claims that JTAG is of critical use for a certain application but doesn't provide any source that supports the statement.|date=October 2017}}  On most systems, JTAG-based debugging is available from the very first instruction after CPU reset, letting it assist with development of early boot software which runs before anything is set up. An [[in-circuit emulator]] (or, more correctly, a \"JTAG adapter\") uses JTAG as the transport mechanism to access on-chip [[debug]] modules inside the target [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Those modules let software developers debug the software of an [[embedded system]] directly at the machine instruction level when needed, or (more typically) in terms of high level language source code.\n\nSystem software debug support is for many software developers the main reason to be interested in JTAG. Many silicon architectures such as PowerPC, MIPS, ARM, x86  built an entire software debug, instruction tracing, and data tracing infrastructure around the basic JTAG protocol. Frequently individual silicon vendors however only implement parts of these extensions. Some examples are ARM [[CoreSight]] and [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] as well as Intel's BTS (Branch Trace Storage), LBR (Last Branch Record), and IPT (Intel Processor Trace) implementations. There are many other such silicon vendor-specific extensions that may not be documented except under [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]]. The adoption of the JTAG standard helped move JTAG-centric debugging environments away from early processor-specific designs.  Processors can normally be halted, single stepped, or let run freely.  One can set code breakpoints, both for code in RAM (often using a special machine instruction) and in ROM/flash.  Data breakpoints are often available, as is bulk data download to RAM.  Most designs have \"halt mode debugging\", but some allow debuggers to access registers and data buses without needing to halt the core being debugged.  Some toolchains can use ARM Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) modules, or equivalent implementations in other architectures to trigger debugger (or tracing) activity on complex hardware events, like a [[logic analyzer]] programmed to ignore the first seven accesses to a register from one particular subroutine.\n\nSometimes [[FPGA]] developers also use JTAG to develop debugging tools.<ref name=\"fpga\">[http://www.embeddeddesignindia.co.in/ART_8800568419_2800006_TA_d2d96055.HTM Select the right FPGA debug method] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427145744/http://www.embeddeddesignindia.co.in/ART_8800568419_2800006_TA_d2d96055.HTM |date=27 April 2010 }} presents one of the models for such tools.</ref>  The same JTAG techniques used to debug software running inside a [[CPU]] can help debug other digital design blocks inside an FPGA.  For example, custom JTAG instructions can be provided to allow reading registers built from arbitrary sets of signals inside the FPGA,  providing visibility for behaviors which are invisible to boundary scan operations.  Similarly, writing such registers could provide controllability which is not otherwise available.\n\n=== Storing firmware ===\n\nJTAG allows [[Programmer (hardware)|device programmer hardware]] to transfer data into internal non-volatile device memory (e.g. [[Complex programmable logic device|CPLDs]]). Some device programmers serve a double purpose for programming as well as debugging the device. In the case of FPGAs, volatile memory devices can also be programmed via the JTAG port, normally during development work. In addition, internal monitoring capabilities (temperature, voltage and current) may be accessible via the JTAG port.\n\nJTAG programmers are also used to write software and data into [[flash memory]].  This is usually done using data bus access like the CPU would use, and is sometimes actually handled by a CPU, but in other cases memory chips have JTAG interfaces themselves.  Some modern debug architectures provide internal and external bus master access without needing to halt and take over a CPU.  In the worst case, it is usually possible to drive external bus signals using the boundary scan facility.\n\nAs a practical matter, when developing an embedded system, emulating the instruction store is the fastest way to implement the \"debug cycle\" (edit, compile, download, test, and debug).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  This is because the in-circuit emulator simulating an instruction store can be updated very quickly from the development host via, say, USB. Using a serial UART port and bootloader to upload firmware to Flash makes this debug cycle quite slow and possibly expensive in terms of tools; installing firmware into Flash (or SRAM instead of Flash) via JTAG is an intermediate solution between these extremes.\n\n=== Boundary scan testing ===\n\nJTAG [[boundary scan]] technology provides access to many logic signals of a complex integrated circuit, including the device pins. The signals are represented in the boundary scan register (BSR) accessible via the TAP. This permits testing as well as controlling the states of the signals for testing and debugging. Therefore, both software and hardware (manufacturing) faults may be located and an operating device may be monitored.\n\nWhen combined with built-in self-test ([[Built-in self-test|BIST]]), the JTAG scan chain enables a low overhead, embedded solution to testing an IC for certain static faults (shorts, opens, and logic errors).  The scan chain mechanism does not generally help diagnose or test for timing, temperature or other dynamic operational errors that may occur.  [[Test case]]s are often provided in standardized formats such as [[Serial Vector Format|SVF]], or its binary sibling XSVF, and used in production tests.  The ability to perform such testing on finished boards is an essential part of [[Design For Test]] in today's products, increasing the number of faults that can be found before products ship to customers.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n\nA JTAG interface is a special interface added to a chip. Depending on the version of JTAG, two, four, or five pins are added. The four and five pin interfaces are designed so that multiple chips on a board can have their JTAG lines [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chained]] together if specific conditions are met.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtagtest.com/faq/jtag-ieee-1149-1/under-what-conditions-can-i-daisy-chain-jtag|title=FAQ: Under what conditions can I daisy-chain JTAG?|website=www.jtagtest.com}}</ref> The two pin interface is designed so that multiple chips can be connected in a [[Star Network|star topology]]. In either case a [[test probe]] need only connect to a single \"JTAG port\" to have access to all chips on a [[circuit board]].\n\n=== Daisy-chained JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) ===\n[[Image:Jtag chain.svg|center|Example of JTAG chain. Test reset signal is not shown]]\n\nThe connector pins are:\n\n#'''TDI''' (Test Data In)\n#'''TDO''' (Test Data Out)\n#'''TCK''' (Test Clock)\n#'''TMS''' (Test Mode Select)\n#'''TRST''' (Test Reset) optional.\n\nThe TRST pin is an optional active-low reset to the test logic, usually asynchronous, but sometimes synchronous, depending on the chip. If the pin is not available, the test logic can be reset by switching to the reset state synchronously, using TCK and TMS.  Note that resetting test logic doesn't necessarily imply resetting anything else.  There are generally some processor-specific JTAG operations which can reset all or part of the chip being debugged.\n\nSince only one data line is available, the protocol is [[Serial communications|serial]]. The clock input is at the TCK pin. One bit of data is transferred in from TDI, and out to TDO per TCK rising clock edge. Different instructions can be loaded. Instructions for typical ICs might read the chip ID, sample input pins, drive (or float) output pins, manipulate chip functions, or bypass (pipe TDI to TDO to logically shorten chains of multiple chips).\n\nAs with any clocked signal, data presented to TDI must be valid for some chip-specific ''Setup'' time before and ''Hold'' time after the relevant (here, rising) clock edge. TDO data is valid for some chip-specific time after the falling edge of TCK.\n\nThe maximum operating frequency of TCK varies depending on all chips in the chain (the lowest speed must be used), but it is typically 10-100&nbsp;MHz (100-10 ns per bit).  Also TCK frequencies depend on board layout and JTAG adapter capabilities and state.  One chip might have a 40&nbsp;MHz JTAG clock, but only if it is using a 200&nbsp;MHz clock for non-JTAG operations; and it might need to use a much slower clock when it is in a low power mode.  Accordingly, some JTAG adapters have ''adaptive clocking'' using an RTCK (Return TCK) signal.  Faster TCK frequencies are most useful when JTAG is used to transfer lots of data, such as when storing a program executable into [[flash memory]].\n\nClocking changes on TMS steps through a standardized JTAG [[state machine]].  The JTAG state machine can reset, access an instruction register, or access data selected by the instruction register.\n\nJTAG platforms often add signals to the handful defined by the IEEE 1149.1 specification.  A System Reset (SRST) signal is quite common, letting debuggers reset the whole system, not just the parts with JTAG support.  Sometimes there are event signals used to trigger activity by the host or by the device being monitored through JTAG; or, perhaps, additional control lines.\n\nEven though few consumer products provide an explicit JTAG port connector, the connections are often available on the [[printed circuit board]] as a remnant from development [[prototype|prototyping]] and/or production. When exploited, these connections often provide the most viable means for [[reverse engineering]].\n\n=== Reduced pin count JTAG (IEEE 1149.7) ===\n[[File:Example of reduced pin count JTAG interface.svg|thumb|Example of JTAG with reduced pin count]]\n\nReduced pin count JTAG uses only two wires, a clock wire and a data wire. This is defined as part of the IEEE 1149.7 standard.<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\"/> The connector pins are:\n\n#'''TMSC''' (Test Serial Data)\n#'''TCKC''' (Test Clock)\n\nIt is called cJTAG for compact JTAG.\n\nThe two wire interface reduced pressure on the number of pins, and devices can be connected in a [[star topology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corelis.com/education/design-testability-tips-guidelines/major-benefits-ieee-1149-7/|title=Major Benefits of IEEE 1149.7|publisher=}}</ref> The star topology enables some parts of the system to be powered down, while others can still be accessed over JTAG; a daisy chain requires all JTAG interfaces to be powered. Other two-wire interfaces exist, such as [[#Similar interface standards|Serial Wire Debug]].\n\n== Communications model ==\n\nIn JTAG, devices expose one or more ''test access ports'' (TAPs).  The picture above shows three TAPs, which might be individual chips or might be modules inside one chip.  A daisy chain of TAPs is called a ''scan chain'', or (loosely) a target.  Scan chains can be arbitrarily long, but in practice twenty TAPs is unusually long.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nTo use JTAG, a host is connected to the target's JTAG signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, etc.) through some kind of ''JTAG adapter'', which may need to handle issues like level shifting and [[galvanic isolation]].  The adapter connects to the host using some interface such as USB, PCI, Ethernet, and so forth.\n\n=== Primitives ===\n\nThe host communicates with the TAPs by manipulating TMS and TDI in conjunction with TCK, and reading results through TDO (which is the only standard host-side input). TMS/TDI/TCK output transitions create the basic JTAG communication primitive on which higher layer protocols build:\n\n* ''State switching'' ... All TAPs are in the same state, and that state changes on TCK transitions.  This JTAG state machine is part of the JTAG spec, and includes sixteen states.  There are six \"stable states\" where keeping TMS stable prevents the state from changing.  In all other states, TCK always changes that state.  In addition, asserting TRST forces entry to one of those stable states (Test_Logic_Reset), in a slightly quicker way than the alternative of holding TMS high and cycling TCK five times.\n* ''Shifting'' ... Most parts of the JTAG state machine support two stable states used to transfer data.  Each TAP has an ''instruction register'' (IR) and a ''data register'' (DR).  The size of those registers varies between TAPs, and those registers are combined through TDI and TDO to form a large shift register.  (The size of the DR is a function of the value in that TAP's current IR, and possibly of the value specified by a SCAN_N instruction.) There are three operations defined on that shift register:\n** ''Capturing'' a temporary value\n*** Entry to the ''Shift_IR'' stable state goes via the Capture_IR state, loading the shift register with a partially fixed value (not the current instruction)\n*** Entry to the ''Shift_DR'' stable state goes via the Capture_DR state, loading the value of the Data Register specified by the TAP's current IR.\n** ''Shifting'' that value bit-by-bit, in either the Shift_IR or Shift_DR stable state; TCK transitions shift the shift register one bit, from TDI towards TDO, exactly like a [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] mode 1 data transfer through a daisy chain of devices (with TMS=0 acting like the chip select signal, TDI as MOSI, etc.).\n** ''Updating'' IR or DR from the temporary value shifted in, on transition through the Update_IR or Update_DR state.  Note that it is not possible to read (capture) a register without writing (updating) it, and vice versa.  A common idiom adds flag bits to say whether the update should have side effects, or whether the hardware is ready to execute such side effects.\n* ''Running'' ... One stable state is called Run_Test/Idle.  The distinction is TAP-specific.  Clocking TCK in the Idle state has no particular side effects, but clocking it in the Run_Test state may change system state.  For example, some [[ARM9]] cores support a debugging mode where TCK cycles in the Run_Test state drive the instruction pipeline.\n\nSo at a basic level, using JTAG involves reading and writing instructions and their associated data registers; and sometimes involves running a number of test cycles.  Behind those registers is hardware that is not specified by JTAG, and which has its own states that is affected by JTAG activities.\n\nMost JTAG hosts use the shortest path between two states, perhaps constrained by quirks of the adapter.  (For example, one adapter{{Which|date=March 2010}} only handles paths whose lengths are multiples of seven bits.)  Some layers built on top of JTAG monitor the state transitions, and use uncommon paths to trigger higher level operations.  Some ARM cores use such sequences to enter and exit a two-wire (non-JTAG) [[Serial Wire Debug|SWD]] mode.  A Zero Bit Scan (ZBS) sequence is used in IEEE 1149.7<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\">Texas Instruments is one adopter behind this standard, and has an [http://tiexpressdsp.com/wiki/index.php?title=IEEE_1149.7 IEEE 1149.7 wiki page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406214032/http://tiexpressdsp.com/wiki/index.php?title=IEEE_1149.7 |date=6 April 2014 }} with more information.</ref> to access advanced functionality such as switching TAPs into and out of scan chains, power management, and a different two-wire mode.\n\n=== JTAG IEEE Std 1149.1 (boundary scan) instructions ===\n\nInstruction register sizes tend to be small, perhaps four or seven bits wide.  Except for BYPASS and EXTEST, all instruction opcodes are defined by the TAP implementor, as are their associated data registers; undefined instruction codes should not be used.  Two key instructions are:\n\n* The BYPASS instruction, an opcode of all ones regardless of the TAP's instruction register size, must be supported by all TAPs.  The instruction selects a single bit data register (also called BYPASS).  The instruction allows this device to be bypassed (do nothing) while other devices in the scan path are exercised.<ref name=\"ieee1149.1-2001\" />\n* The optional IDCODE instruction, with an implementor-defined opcode.  IDCODE is associated with a 32-bit register (IDCODE).  Its data uses a standardized format that includes a manufacturer code (derived from the [[JEDEC]] ''Standard Manufacturer's Identification Code'' standard, JEP-106), a part number assigned by the manufacturer, and a part version code.  IDCODE is widely, but not universally, supported.\n\nOn exit from the RESET state, the instruction register is preloaded with either BYPASS or IDCODE.  This allows JTAG hosts to identify the size and, at least partially, contents of the scan chain to which they are connected.  (They can enter the RESET state then scan the Data Register until they read back the data they wrote.  A BYPASS register has only a zero bit; while an IDCODE register is 32-bits and starts with a one.  So the bits not written by the host can easily be mapped to TAPs.)  Such identification is often used to sanity check manual configuration, since IDCODE is often unspecific.  It could for example identify an ARM Cortex-M3 based microcontroller, without specifying the microcontroller vendor or model; or a particular FPGA, but not how it has been programmed.\n\nA common idiom involves shifting BYPASS into the instruction registers of all TAPs except one, which receives some other instruction.  That way all TAPs except one expose a single bit data register, and values can be selectively shifted into or out of that one TAP's data register without affecting any other TAP.\n\nThe IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) standard describes a number of instructions to support boundary scan applications.  Some of these instructions are \"mandatory\", but TAPs used for debug instead of boundary scan testing sometimes provide minimal or no support for these instructions.  Those \"mandatory\" instructions operate on the Boundary Scan Register (BSR) defined in the [[boundary scan description language|BSDL]] file, and include:\n\n* EXTEST for external testing, such as using pins to probe board-level behaviors\n* PRELOAD loading pin output values before EXTEST (sometimes combined with SAMPLE)\n* SAMPLE reading pin values into the boundary scan register\n\nIEEE-defined \"Optional\" instructions include:\n* CLAMP a variant of BYPASS which drives the output pins using the PRELOADed values\n* HIGHZ deactivates the outputs of all pins\n* INTEST for internal testing, such as using pins to probe on-chip behaviors\n* RUNBIST places the chip in a self-test mode\n* USERCODE returns a user-defined code, for example to identify which FPGA image is active\n\nDevices may define more instructions, and those definitions should be part of a BSDL file provided by the manufacturer.  They are often only marked as PRIVATE.\n\n=== Boundary scan register ===\n\nDevices communicate to the world via a set of input and output pins. By themselves, these pins provide limited visibility into the workings of the device. However, devices that support [[boundary scan]] contain a shift-register cell for each signal pin of the device. These registers are connected in a dedicated path around the device's boundary (hence the name). The path creates a virtual access capability that circumvents the normal inputs and outputs, providing direct control of the device and detailed visibility for signals.<ref name=\"oshana\">{{cite news\n | first = Rob\n | last = Oshana\n | url = http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/beginner-s-corner/4024466/Introduction-to-JTAG\n | title = Introduction to JTAG\n | work = Embedded Systems Design\n | date = 29 October 2002\n | accessdate =5 April 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nThe contents of the boundary scan register, including signal I/O capabilities, are usually described by the manufacturer using a part-specific [[boundary scan description language|BSDL]] file.  These are used with design 'netlists' from CAD/EDA systems to develop tests used in board manufacturing.  Commercial test systems often cost several thousand dollars for a complete system, and  include diagnostic options to pinpoint faults such as open circuits and shorts.  They may also offer schematic or layout viewers to depict the fault in a graphical manner.\n\nTo enable boundary scanning, IC vendors add logic to each of their devices, including scan cells for each of the signal pins. These cells are then connected together to form the boundary scan shift register (BSR), which is connected to a TAP controller. These designs are parts of most Verilog or VHDL libraries.  Overhead for this additional logic is minimal, and generally is well worth the price to enable efficient testing at the board level.\n\n== Example: ARM11 debug TAP ==\n\nAn example helps show the operation of JTAG in real systems.  The example here is the debug TAP of an [[ARM11]] processor, the ARM1136<ref name=\"ARM1136\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0211k/DDI0211K_arm1136_r1p5_trm.pdf ARM1136JF-S and ARM1136J-S Technical Reference Manual] revision r1p5, ARM DDI 0211K.  Chapter 14 presents the Debug TAP.  Other ARM11 cores present the same model through their Debug TAPs.</ref> core.  The processor itself has extensive JTAG capability, similar to what is found in other CPU cores, and it is integrated into chips with even more extensive capabilities accessed through JTAG.\n\nThis is a non-trivial example, which is representative of a significant cross section of JTAG-enabled systems.  In addition, it shows how control mechanisms are built using JTAG's register read/write primitives, and how those combine to facilitate testing and debugging complex logic elements; [[CPU]]s are common, but [[FPGA]]s and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s include other complex elements which need to be debugged.\n\nLicensees of this core integrate it into chips, usually combining it with other TAPs as well as numerous peripherals and memory.  One of those other TAPs handles boundary scan testing for the whole chip; it is not supported by the debug TAP.  Examples of such chips include:\n\n* The [[Texas Instruments OMAP|OMAP2420]], which includes a boundary scan TAP, the ARM1136 Debug TAP, an ETB11 trace buffer TAP, a [[Texas Instruments TMS320|C55x DSP]], and a TAP for an [[ARM7]] TDMI-based imaging engine, with the boundary scan TAP (\"ICEpick-B\") having the ability to splice TAPs into and out of the JTAG scan chain.<ref name=\"omap2420\">Documentation for the OMAP2420 is not publicly available.  However, a [[Texas Instruments]] document [http://wiki.davincidsp.com/images/9/90/Dbjtag_users_guide.pdf The User's Guide to DBGJTAG] discussing a JTAG diagnostic tool presents this OMAP2420 scan chain example (and others).</ref>\n* The [[i.MX31]] processor, which is similar, although its \"System JTAG\" boundary scan TAP,<ref name=\"iMX31\">See \"i.MX35 (MCIMX35) Multimedia Applications Processor Reference Manual\" from the [[Freescale]] web site.  Chapter 44 presents its \"Secure JTAG Controller\" (SJC).</ref> which is very different from ICEpick, and it includes a TAP for its DMA engine instead of a DSP and imaging engine.\n\nThose processors are both intended for use in wireless handsets such as cell phones, which is part of the reason they include TAP controllers which modify the JTAG scan chain:  Debugging low power operation requires accessing chips when they are largely powered off, and thus when not all TAPs are operational.  That scan chain modification is one subject of a forthcoming IEEE 1149.7<ref name=\"ieee-1149.7\"/> standard.\n\n=== JTAG facilities ===\n\nThis debug TAP exposes several standard instructions, and a few specifically designed for hardware-assisted [[debugging]], where a software tool (the \"debugger\") uses JTAG to communicate with a system being debugged:\n\n* <code>BYPASS</code> and <code>IDCODE</code>, standard instructions as described above\n* <code>EXTEST</code>, <code>INTEST</code>, standard instructions, but operating on the core instead of an external boundary scan chain.  <code>EXTEST</code> is nominally for writing data to the core, <code>INTEST</code> is nominally for reading it; but two scan chains are exceptions to that rule.\n* <code>SCAN_N</code> ARM instruction to select the numbered scan chain used with <code>EXTEST</code> or <code>INTEST</code>.  There are six scan chains:\n** <code>0</code> - Device ID Register, 40 bits of read-only identification data\n** <code>1</code> - Debug Status and Control Register (DSCR), 32 bits used to operate the debug facilities\n** <code>4</code> - Instruction Transfer Register (ITR), 33 bits (32 instruction plus one status bit) used to execute processor instructions while in a special \"Debug Mode\" (see below)\n** <code>5</code> - Debug Communications Channel (DCC), 34 bits (one long data word plus two status bits) used for bidirectional data transfer to the core.  This is used both in debug mode, and possibly at runtime when talking to debugger-aware software.\n** <code>6</code> - Embedded Trace Module (ETM), 40 bits (7 bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to control the operation of a passive instruction and data trace mechanism.  This feeds either an on-chip Embedded Trace Buffer (ETB), or an external high speed trace data collection pod.  Tracing supports passive debugging (examining execution history) and profiling for performance tuning.\n** <code>7</code> - debug module, 40 bits (7 bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to access hardware breakpoints, watchpoints, and more.  These can be written while the processor is running; it does not need to be in Debug Mode.\n* <code>HALT</code> and <code>RESTART</code>, ARM11-specific instructions to halt and restart the CPU.  Halting it puts the core into the \"Debug Mode\", where the ITR can be used to execute instructions, including using the DCC to transfer data between the debug (JTAG) host and the CPU.\n* <code>ITRSEL</code>, ARM11-specific instruction to accelerate some operations with ITR.\nThat model resembles the model used in other ARM cores.  Non-ARM systems generally have similar capabilities, perhaps implemented using the [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] protocols on top of JTAG, or other vendor-specific schemes.\n\nOlder [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]] cores include an ''EmbeddedICE'' module<ref name=\"arm9ejs\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0222b/DDI0222.pdf ARM9EJ-S Technical Reference Manual] revision r1p2.  Appendix B \"Debug in Depth\" presents the EmbeddedICE-RT module, as seen in the popular ARM926ejs core.</ref> which combines most of those facilities, but has an awkward mechanism for instruction execution:  the debugger must drive the CPU instruction pipeline, clock by clock, and directly access the data buses to read and write data to the CPU.  The ARM11 uses the same model for trace support (ETM, ETB) as those older cores.\n\nNewer ARM Cortex cores closely resemble this debug model, but build on a ''Debug Access Port'' (DAP) instead of direct CPU access.  In this architecture (named ''CoreSight Technology''), core and JTAG module is completely independent.  They are also decoupled from JTAG so they can be hosted over ARM's two-wire '''SWD''' interface (see below) instead of just the six-wire JTAG interface.  (ARM takes the four standard JTAG signals and adds the optional TRST, plus the RTCK signal used for adaptive clocking.) The CoreSight JTAG-DP is asynchronous to the core clocks, and does not implement RTCK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/Chdhbbjd.html#Chdihede|title=CoreSight Components Technical Reference Manual: 2.3.2.\u00a0Implementation specific details|website=infocenter.arm.com}}</ref>  Also, the newer cores have updated trace support.\n\n=== Halt mode debugging ===\n\nOne basic way to debug software is to present a single threaded model, where the debugger periodically stops execution of the program and examines its state as exposed by register contents and memory (including peripheral controller registers).  When interesting program events approach, a person may want to single step instructions (or lines of source code) to watch how a particular misbehavior happens.\n\nSo for example a JTAG host might HALT the core, entering Debug Mode, and then read CPU registers using ITR and DCC.  After saving processor state, it could write those registers with whatever values it needs, then execute arbitrary algorithms on the CPU, accessing memory and peripherals to help characterize the system state.  After the debugger performs those operations, the state may be restored and execution continued using the RESTART instruction.\n\nDebug mode is also entered asynchronously by the debug module triggering a watchpoint or breakpoint, or by issuing a BKPT (breakpoint) instruction from the software being debugged.  When it is not being used for instruction tracing, the ETM can also trigger entry to debug mode; it supports complex triggers sensitive to state and history, as well as the simple address comparisons exposed by the debug module.  Asynchronous transitions to debug mode are detected  by polling the DSCR register.  This is how single stepping is implemented:  HALT the core, set a temporary breakpoint at the next instruction or next high-level statement, RESTART, poll DSCR until you detect  asynchronous entry to debug state, remove that temporary breakpoint, repeat.\n\n=== Monitor mode debugging ===\n\nModern software is often too complex to work well with such a single threaded model.  For example, a processor used to control a motor (perhaps one driving a saw blade) may not be able to safely enter halt mode; it may need to continue handling interrupts to ensure physical safety of people and/or machinery.  Issuing a HALT instruction using JTAG might be dangerous.\n\nARM processors support an alternative debug mode, called ''Monitor Mode'', to work with such situations.  (This is distinct from the ''Secure Monitor Mode'' implemented as part of security extensions on newer ARM cores; it manages debug operations, not security transitions.)  In those cases, breakpoints and watchpoints trigger a special kind of hardware exception, transferring control to a \"debug monitor\" running as part of the system software.  This monitor communicates with the debugger using the DCC, and could arrange for example to single step only a single process while other processes (and interrupt handlers) continue running.\n\n== Common extensions ==\n\nMicroprocessor vendors have often defined their own core-specific debugging extensions.  Such vendors include [[Infineon]], MIPS with EJTAG, and more.  If the vendor does not adopt a standard (such as the ones used by ARM processors; or Nexus), they need to define their own solution.  If they support boundary scan, they generally build debugging over JTAG.\n\n[[Freescale]] has COP and OnCE (On-Chip Emulation). OnCE includes a JTAG command which makes a TAP enter a special mode where the IR holds OnCE debugging commands<ref name=\"OnCE\">AN1817/D, \"MMC20xx M\u2022CORE OnCE Port Communication and Control Sequences\"; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; 2004.  Not all processors support the same OnCE module.</ref> for operations such as single stepping, breakpointing, and accessing registers or memory.  It also defines EOnCE (Enhanced On-Chip Emulation)<ref name=\"EOnCE\">AN2073 \"Differences Between the EOnCE and OnCE Ports\"; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; 2005.</ref> presented as addressing real time concerns.\n\n[[ARM architecture|ARM]] has an extensive processor core debug architecture (CoreSight) that started with EmbeddedICE (a debug facility available on most ARM cores), and now includes many additional components such as an ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell), with a high speed trace port, supporting multi-core and multithread tracing.  Note that tracing is non-invasive; systems do not need to stop operating to be traced.  (However, trace data is too voluminous to use JTAG as more than a trace control channel.)\n\n[[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] defines a processor debug infrastructure which is largely vendor-independent.  One of its hardware interfaces is JTAG.  It also defines a high speed auxiliary port interface, used for tracing and more.  Nexus is used with some newer platforms, such as the [[Atmel]] AVR32 and Freescale MPC5500 series processors.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n* Except for some of the very lowest end systems, essentially all [[embedded systems]] platforms have a JTAG port to support in-circuit debugging and firmware programming as well as for boundary scan testing:\n** [[ARM architecture]] processors come with JTAG support, sometimes supporting a two-wire \"SWD\" variant or high speed tracing of traffic on instruction or data busses.\n** Modern 8-bit and 16-bit [[microcontroller]] chips, such as [[Atmel AVR]] and [[TI MSP430]] chips, support JTAG programming and debugging.  However, the very smallest chips may not have enough pins to spare (and thus tend to rely on proprietary single-wire programming interfaces); if the pin count is over 32, there is probably a JTAG option.\n** Almost all [[FPGA]]s and [[CPLD]]s used today can be programmed via a JTAG port. A [[Standard Test and Programming Language]] is defined by JEDEC standard JESD-71 for JTAG programming of PLD's.\n** Many [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[PowerPC]] processors have JTAG support\n** Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, and Quark processors all support JTAG probe mode with Intel specific extensions of JTAG using the so-called 60-pin eXtended Debug Port [XDP]. Additionally the Quark processor supports more traditional 10-pin connectors.\n** Consumer products such as networking appliances and [[satellite television]] [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s often use microprocessors which support JTAG, providing an alternate means to reload [[firmware]] if the existing [[bootloader]] has been corrupted in some manner.\n*The [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus connector standard contains optional JTAG signals on pins 1-5;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm#4.10|title=PCI Local Bus Technical Summary, 4.10 JTAG/Boundary Scan Pins|publisher=|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107201536/http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm#4.10|archive-date=7 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[PCI Express]] contains JTAG signals on pins 5-9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_PCI_Express_16x_PinOut.html|title=Serial PCI Express Bus 16x Pinout and PCIe Pin out Signal names|website=www.interfacebus.com}}</ref> A special JTAG card can be used to reflash a corrupt [[BIOS]].\n* Boundary scan testing and in-system (device) programming applications are sometimes programmed using the [[Serial Vector Format]], a textual representation of JTAG operations using a simple syntax. Other programming formats include 'JAM' and STAPL plus more recently the IEEE Std. 1532 defined format 'ISC' (short for In-System Configuration). ISC format is used in conjunction with enhanced BSDL models for programmable logic devices (i.e. FPGAs and CPLDs) that include addition ISC_<operation> instructions in addition to the basic bare minimum IEEE 1149.1 instructions. FPGA programming tools from [[Xilinx]], Altera, Lattice, Cypress, Actel, etc. typically are able to export such files.\n* As mentioned, many boards include JTAG connectors, or just pads, to support manufacturing operations, where boundary scan testing helps verify board quality (identifying bad solder joints, etc.) and to initialize [[flash memory]] or FPGAs.\n* JTAG can also support field updates and troubleshooting.\n\n== Client support ==\n\nThe target's JTAG interface is accessed using some JTAG-enabled application and some JTAG adapter hardware.  There is a wide range of such hardware, optimized for purposes such as production testing, debugging high speed systems, low cost microcontroller development, and so on.  In the same way, the software used to drive such hardware can be quite varied.  Software developers mostly use JTAG for debugging and updating firmware.\n\n=== Connectors ===\n[[Image:Netgear ProSafe Dual WAN VPN Gigabit Firewall FVS336G JTAG interface.jpeg|thumb|right|A [[Netgear]] FVS336G [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] with a 14 pin JTAG header at lower left.]]\n[[Image:ADSL modem router internals labeled.jpg|thumb|right|A Netgear DG632 [[ADSL modem]] with an 8 pin JTAG header at location \"5\".]]\n\nThere are no official standards for JTAG adapter physical connectors.  Development boards usually include a header to support preferred development tools; in some cases they include multiple such headers, because they need to support multiple such tools.  For example, a microcontroller, FPGA, and ARM application processor rarely share tools, so a development board using all of those components might have three or more headers.  Production boards may omit the headers, or when space is limited may provide JTAG signal access using test points.\n\nSome common pinouts<ref>[http://www.jtagtest.com/pinouts/ JTAG Pinouts] lists a few JTAG-only header layouts that have widespread tool support.</ref> for {{convert|2.54|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[pin header]]s are:\n\n* ARM 2\u00d710 pin (or sometimes the older 2\u00d77), used by almost all ARM based systems\n* MIPS EJTAG (2\u00d77 pin) used for [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] based systems\n* 2\u00d75 pin [[Altera]] ByteBlaster-compatible JTAG extended by many vendors\n* 2\u00d75 pin [[Atmel AVR|AVR]] extends Altera JTAG with SRST (and in some cases TRST and an event output)\n* 2\u00d77 pin [[Texas Instruments]] used with [[Texas Instruments TMS320|DSPs]] and ARM-based products such as [[OMAP]]\n* 8 pin (single row) generic PLD JTAG compatible with many Lattice ispDOWNLOAD cables\n* [[MIPI Debug Architecture|MIPI]]10-/20-connectors (1.27&nbsp;mm 050\") for JTAG, cJTAG and SWD\n\nThose connectors tend to include more than just the four standardized signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO).  Usually reset signals are provided, one or both of TRST (TAP reset) and SRST (system reset).  The connector usually provides the board-under-test's logic supply voltage so that the JTAG adapters use the appropriate logic levels<!-- eg 5, 3.3, ..., 1V, ... -->. The board voltage may also serve as a \"board present\" debugger input.  Other event input or output signals may be provided, or [[General Purpose Input/Output|general purpose I/O]] (GPIO) lines, to support more complex debugging architectures.\n\nHigher end products frequently use dense connectors (frequently 38-pin [[MICTOR]] connectors) to support high-speed [[Tracing (software)|tracing]] in conjunction with JTAG operations.  A recent trend is to have development boards integrate a USB interface to JTAG, where a second channel is used for a serial port.  (Smaller boards can also be powered through USB.  Since modern PCs tend to omit serial ports, such integrated debug links can significantly reduce clutter for developers.)  Production boards often rely on [[Bed of nails tester|bed-of-nails]] connections to test points for testing and programming.\n\n=== Adapter hardware ===\nAdapter hardware varies widely.  When not integrated into a development board, it involves a short cable to attach to a JTAG connector on the target board; a connection to the debugging host, such as a USB, PCI, or Ethernet link; and enough electronics to adapt the two communications domains (and sometimes provide [[galvanic isolation]]).  A separate power supply may be needed. There are both \"dumb\" adapters, where the host decides and performs all JTAG operations; and \"smart\" ones, where some of that work is performed inside the adapter, often driven by a microcontroller.  The \"smart\" adapters eliminate link latencies for operation sequences that may involve polling for status changes between steps, and may accordingly offer faster throughput.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, adapters with a [[USB]] link from the host are the most common approach.  Higher end products often support [[Ethernet]], with the advantage that the debug host can be quite remote.  Adapters which support high speed trace ports generally include several megabytes of trace buffer and provide high speed links (USB or Ethernet) to get that data to the host.\n\n[[Parallel port]] adapters are simple and inexpensive, but they are relatively slow because they use the host CPU to change each bit (\"[[bit banging]]\"). They have declined in usefulness because most computers in recent years don't have a parallel port.  Driver support is also a problem, because pin usage by adapters varied widely.  Since the parallel port is based on 5V logic level, most adapters lacked voltage translation support for 3.3V or 1.8V target voltages.\n\nRS-232 [[serial port]] adapters also exist, and are similarly declining in usefulness.  They generally involve either slower bit banging than a parallel port, or a microcontroller translating some command protocol to JTAG operations.  Such serial adapters are also not fast, but their command protocols could generally be reused on top of higher speed links.\n\nWith all JTAG adapters, software support is a basic concern.  Many vendors do not publish the protocols used by their JTAG adapter hardware, limiting their customers to the tool chains supported by those vendors.  This is a particular issue for \"smart\" adapters, some of which embed significant amounts of knowledge about how to interact with specific CPUs.\n\n=== Software development ===\n\nMost development environments for embedded software include JTAG support.  There are, broadly speaking, three sources of such software:\n\n* ''Chip Vendors'' may provide the tools, usually requiring a JTAG adapter they supply.  Examples include FPGA vendors such as [[Xilinx]] and [[Altera]], [[Atmel]] for its AVR8 and AVR32 product lines, and [[Texas Instruments]] for most of its DSP and micro products.  Such tools tend to be highly featured, and may be the only real option for highly specialized chips like FPGAs and DSPs.  Lower end software tools may be provided free of charge.  The JTAG adapters themselves are not free, although sometimes they are bundled with development boards.\n* ''Tool Vendors'' may supply them, usually in conjunction with multiple chip vendors to provide cross-platform development support.  [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based products have a particularly rich third party market, and a number of those vendors have expanded to non-ARM platforms like [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[PowerPC]].  Tool vendors sometimes build products around free software like [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[GNU Debugger|GDB]], with GUI support frequently using [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].  JTAG adapters are sometimes sold along with support bundles.\n* ''Open Source'' tools exist.  As noted above, GCC and GDB form the core of a good toolchain, and there are GUI environments to support them.\n\nAll such software tends to include basic debugger support:  stopping, halting, single stepping, breakpoints, data structure browsing, and so on.\nCommercial tools tend to provide tools like very accurate simulators and trace analysis, which are not currently available as open source.\n\n== {{anchor|Serial_Wire_Debug}} Similar interface standards ==\n\n''Serial Wire Debug'' (SWD) is an alternative 2-pin electrical interface that uses the same protocol. It uses the existing GND connection.  SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ihi0031c/index.html|title=ARM Information Center|website=infocenter.arm.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}</ref>  This enables the debugger to become another [[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]] bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers. Data rate is up to  {{nowrap|4 Mbytes/sec}} {{nowrap|at 50 MHz}}. SWD also has built-in error detection.  On JTAG devices with SWD capability, the TMS and TCK are used as SWDIO and SWCLK signals, providing for dual-mode programmers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Automated optical inspection]]\n* [[Automated x-ray inspection]]\n* [[In-circuit test]]\n* [[Acceptance testing]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5412866 IEEE Standard for Reduced-Pin and Enhanced-Functionality Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture] The official IEEE 1149.7 Standard.\n* [http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/jtag-101-ieee-1149x-paper.pdf JTAG 101 - IEEE 1149.x and Software Debug] Intel whitepaper on JTAG usage in system software debug across a wide range of architectures.\n* [http://www.ti.com/lit/an/ssya002c/ssya002c.pdf IEEE Std 1149.1 (JTAG) Testability Primer] Includes a strong technical presentation about JTAG, with design-for-test chapters.\n* [https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/test-methods/boundary-scan-jtag-ieee1149/what-is-boundary-scan-jtag.php Boundary Scan / IEEE 1149 tutorial] including details of variants of the IEEE standard, BSDL, DFT, and other topics\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/JTAG_Tutorial.htm JTAG Tutorial] Useful tutorials and information on JTAG technology.\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/What-Is-JTAG.htm What is JTAG?] Useful information on JTAG, timeline, architecture and more.\n* [http://www.corelis.com/education/JTAG-Applications.htm JTAG Applications] JTAG for product development, life cycle, testing, tools needed, and other topics.\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n{{Microcontrollers}}\n\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[Category:IEEE standards]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Hardware testing]]\n[[Category:Printed circuit board manufacturing]]\n", "name_user": "SteveGotthardt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBoundary scan testing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG"}

The words \"salaiset\" and \"salatut\" have a semantic difference. --> Lives'') is a [[Finland|Finnish]] television soap opera that premiered on [[MTV3]] on 25 January 1999.\n\nDuring the series' 21-year run, over 3,700 episodes have been aired, making it the longest running drama in television in the [[Nordic countries|Nordics]]. On 12 June 2017, it was announced that ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' will be on the air until the summer 2023<ref>http://www.mtv.fi/viihde/ohjelmat/salatut-elamat/uutiset/artikkeli/mtv-solmi-historiallisen-sopimuksen-suomen-pitkaikaisin-draamasarja-salatut-elamat-jatkuu-vuoteen-2023/6468296 \u2013 MTV.fi (Finnish)</ref> making the series the longest-lasting drama series of all time in Finland. The series' storylines follow the daily lives of several families who live in the same apartment block in [[Helsinki]]. The series primarily centres on the residents of Pihlajakatu and its neighbouring areas. Only five of the original twenty characters [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Ismo]] ([[Esko Kovero]]), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle]] ([[Pete Lattu]]), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Ulla]] ([[Maija-Liisa Peuhu]]), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Aki]] ([[Sami Uotila (actor)|Sami Uotila]]) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kari]] ([[Tommi Taurula]]) still remain in the series, and most of the series' current characters have made their debuts in 2014 or later.\n\nMTV3 also airs reruns of the series every weekend (Monday-Wednesday episodes on Saturday, Thursday-Friday episodes on Sunday). In the summer, the channel airs reruns of the series; in the summer of 2014, episodes from the season 2009\u20132010 were aired.\n\nEight web spin-off series have been made; ''Romeo & Rafael Desperados'' in 2008, ''Lillukanvarsia'' in 2010\u20132011, ''Tuuliranta'' in 2011\u20132012, ''Young Man Cash Man'' in 2013, ''Young Girl, Dream Girl'' in 2014, ''Satula'' in 2015, ''Bikineit\u00e4 ja timantteja'' (or in English known as ''Bikinis and Diamonds'') in 2016 and ''Pihlajakadun tuhmat t\u00e4dit'' in 2016\u20132017.\n\nOn 5 December 2012, the first ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' movie was released. The teen thriller movie ''Nightmare \u2013 Painajainen merell\u00e4'' (''\"Nightmare \u2013 Nightmare at Sea\"'') was one of the most watched Finnish films of 2012. The film was directed by Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 and the main characters are [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Peppi]] (Sara S\u00e4kkinen), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Heidi]] (Venla Savikuja), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jiri]] (Mikko Parikka), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Joonatan]] (Markku Pulli), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Miro]] (Patrik Borodavkin), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Oona]] (Sara Lohiniva) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Sampo]] (Sampsa Tuomala). Nightmare - Painajainen merell\u00e4 also won the [[Jussi Award]] in the category Public Favorite. A second film, called ''Nightmare 2'' was released in December 2014.{{CN|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe show's gay storyline between [[Elias Vikstedt|Elias]] (Petteri Paavola) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Lari]] (Ronny R\u00f6sl\u00f6f), nicknamed \"Larias\", initially proved very popular on [[YouTube]]. Scenes featuring their storyline were uploaded by a user called \"missfinlandia88\". As her account got terminated, she created a new one, \"Elias' Story\". She claims to have had the permission of MTV3 and FremantleMedia to post the clips.<ref>http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ (Finnish)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101025/http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ |date=28 September 2013 }}</ref> Elias was killed off in November 2016 but was seen in some dream scenes later on. The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\n==Themes==\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as [[abortion]], [[drug abuse]], [[alcoholism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[animal rights]], [[rape]], [[religious fanaticism]], [[gambling addiction]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[domestic violence]], [[cancer]], [[eating disorder]], [[school bullying]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, [[stealing]] and [[racism]]; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''. Former \"main caf\u00e9\" was ''Kentauri'' which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4''t has also filmed scenes in [[Tampere]] and in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. A few episodes have also been filmed in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Lithuania]] and [[London]].\n\n==Theme song==\nThe original theme song was called ''Tunteisiin'' and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n!

The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\n==Themes==\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as [[abortion]], [[drug abuse]], [[alcoholism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[animal rights]], [[rape]], [[religious fanaticism]], [[gambling addiction]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[domestic violence]], [[cancer]], [[eating disorder]], [[school bullying]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, [[stealing]] and [[racism]]; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''. Former \"main caf\u00e9\" was ''Kentauri'' which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4''t has also filmed scenes in [[Tampere]] and in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. A few episodes have also been filmed in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Lithuania]] and [[London]].\n\n==Theme song==\nThe original theme song was called ''Tunteisiin'' and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n!
