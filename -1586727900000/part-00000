Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

His career began with the songs \"A Solas\", \"Luz Apaga\", \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera]]\", and \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera (Remix)]]\". His career began also with a Christian song. On October 25, 2019, he released his debut album ''[[\u00c9pico]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nAs a child, his true passion was drums and soccer. Thanks to this sport, Osorio found his vocation in music. From an early age he wanted to be part of the urban genre motivated by what other singers of the genre in Latin America were achieving. At age 12, he began recording [[freestyle rap]]s, which he uploaded to [[Facebook]]. He used to improvise in front of his soccer teammates, with several of his clips going viral.<ref>{{cite news|title=LUNAY: DE HACER FREESTYLE EN FACEBOOK A GRABAR CON OZUNA|url=https://historia-biografia.com/lunay/|date=2 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BIOGRAF\u00cdA DE LUNAY|url= https://buenavibra.com/2018/11/27/lunay}}</ref> His freestyle raps caught the attention of producers like [[Chris Jeday]] and Gaby Music. Lunay's favorite food is Mofongo de Camarones al Ajillo. His favorite color is red. He has a dog named Lulu. He has an older brother and two younger sisters.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2017, he started uploading small musical projects to [[SoundCloud]] under the name of \"Jefnier\", entering more seriously in the music industry. In 2017, he launched \"Aparentas\", reaching thousands of reproductions on this platform, attracting the attention of two of the most recognized producers in Puerto Rico: [[Chris Jeday]] and Gaby Music. Both producers contacted the young Puerto Rican offering him a record deal and after signing, in May 2018, he changed his stage name to Lunay.\n\nThat same month he released the song \"Si Te Vas Conmigo\", and a month later \"Dejame Saber\". The same year they came out with \"A Solas\" featuring Lyanno and \"Como La Primera Vez\" with Amarion. One of his first collaborations was \"Luz Apaga\" with [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], Rauw Alejandro and Lyanno, reaching millions of views on YouTube. At the end of 2018, the remix of \"A Solas\" was released with [[Anuel AA]], [[Brytiago]] and Alex Rose, positioning for several days on the YouTube Trending page. In March 2019, he released his single \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera]]\", which achieved more than five million views in five days on YouTube. \"Soltera\" was also remixed in a version featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Bad Bunny]], also Puerto Rican urban singers.\n\n==Musical style==\nOn his musical style, Lunay has commented that his songs do not encourage violence or denigrate women. In an interview he gave to the top 40, he said: \"Not necessarily, even if I am in this world of urban music, [do] I have to be fostering violence, which is against God's purpose. I just do what I like and I know the relationship I have with Him.\" He won the award for artist \"on the rise\" at the [[2019 Premios Juventud]].\n\n==Discography==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n!

His career began with the songs \"A Solas\", \"Luz Apaga\", \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera]]\", and \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera (Remix)]]\". His career began also with a Christian song. On October 25, 2019, he released his debut album ''[[\u00c9pico]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nAs a child, his true passion was drums and soccer. Thanks to this sport, Osorio found his vocation in music. From an early age he wanted to be part of the urban genre motivated by what other singers of the genre in Latin America were achieving. At age 12, he began recording [[freestyle rap]]s, which he uploaded to [[Facebook]]. He used to improvise in front of his soccer teammates, with several of his clips going viral.<ref>{{cite news|title=LUNAY: DE HACER FREESTYLE EN FACEBOOK A GRABAR CON OZUNA|url=https://historia-biografia.com/lunay/|date=2 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BIOGRAF\u00cdA DE LUNAY|url= https://buenavibra.com/2018/11/27/lunay}}</ref> His freestyle raps caught the attention of producers like [[Chris Jeday]] and Gaby Music. Lunay's favorite food is Mofongo de Camarones al Ajillo. His favorite color is red. He has a dog named Lulu. He has an older brother and two younger sisters.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2017, he started uploading small musical projects to [[SoundCloud]] under the name of \"Jefnier\", entering more seriously in the music industry. In 2017, he launched \"Aparentas\", reaching thousands of reproductions on this platform, attracting the attention of two of the most recognized producers in Puerto Rico: [[Chris Jeday]] and Gaby Music. Both producers contacted the young Puerto Rican offering him a record deal and after signing, in May 2018, he changed his stage name to Lunay.\n\nThat same month he released the song \"Si Te Vas Conmigo\", and a month later \"Dejame Saber\". The same year they came out with \"A Solas\" featuring Lyanno and \"Como La Primera Vez\" with Amarion. One of his first collaborations was \"Luz Apaga\" with [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], Rauw Alejandro and Lyanno, reaching millions of views on YouTube. At the end of 2018, the remix of \"A Solas\" was released with [[Anuel AA]], [[Brytiago]] and Alex Rose, positioning for several days on the YouTube Trending page. In March 2019, he released his single \"[[Soltera (song)|Soltera]]\", which achieved more than five million views in five days on YouTube. \"Soltera\" was also remixed in a version featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Bad Bunny]], also Puerto Rican urban singers.\n\n==Musical style==\nOn his musical style, Lunay has commented that his songs do not encourage violence or denigrate women. In an interview he gave to the top 40, he said: \"Not necessarily, even if I am in this world of urban music, [do] I have to be fostering violence, which is against God's purpose. I just do what I like and I know the relationship I have with Him.\" He won the award for artist \"on the rise\" at the [[2019 Premios Juventud]].\n\n==Discography==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n!

Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>Margolis, J. et al. (1999).

The MIT Press. p.4.</ref> Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were \"geeks,\" with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers \"become their life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \"real\" power and power on a screen. \"I see a computer as a tool,\" a high school girl declares. \"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\"<ref>AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000).

McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.</ref> has highlighted such factors as:\n\n* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \"weedout\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.\n* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.\n* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that \"women can do computing as well as men\".\n* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.\n\nJust like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \"extra help\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\"/> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"]. Catalyst.</ref> Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.\n\n===Stereotyping computer scientists===\nOther research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.<ref name=\"Ortutay 2017\">{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}</ref> Nonetheless, it has been found that a women\u2019s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.<ref name=\"Trusty 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.\n\n===Twenty-first century efforts===\n{{Globalize section|US|date=February 2020}}\n\n====National Center for Women & Information Technology====\n[[National Center for Women & Information Technology]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J. Mcgrath| last2 =  Nigai| first2 =  Sergey| last3 =  Kaye| first3 =  Joseph \"Jofish\"| year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72\u201380 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}</ref> A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single, brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>Margolis, J. et al. (1999).

The MIT Press. p.4.</ref> Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were \"geeks,\" with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers \"become their life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \"real\" power and power on a screen. \"I see a computer as a tool,\" a high school girl declares. \"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\"<ref>AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf \"Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age\"], p.8.</ref> Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.\n\nNearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.<ref name=\"digital divide\"/> Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.<ref name=\"digital divide\" />\n\nThis is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.<ref name=\"digital divide\"/>\n\n===Barriers to advancement===\nResearch on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computing<ref>Cohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.</ref> has highlighted such factors as:\n\n* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \"weedout\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.\n* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.\n* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that \"women can do computing as well as men\".\n* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.\n\nJust like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \"extra help\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\"/> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"]. Catalyst.</ref> Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.\n\n===Stereotyping computer scientists===\nOther research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.<ref name=\"Ortutay 2017\">{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}</ref> Nonetheless, it has been found that a women\u2019s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.<ref name=\"Trusty 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.\n\n===Twenty-first century efforts===\n{{Globalize section|US|date=February 2020}}\n\n====National Center for Women & Information Technology====\n[[National Center for Women & Information Technology]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

One example being the Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality. All OSCE states follow policies to ensure gender equality in all work fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osce.org/pc/14713|title=2004 OSCE Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:2nd_OSCE_Gender_Equality_Review_Conference.jpg|thumb|2nd OSCE Gender Equality Review Conference]]\n\n====Postsecondary education organization====\nNumerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC).

WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=2014-02-11}}</ref>\n\n====Pacesetters====\nIn an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called \"Pacesetters\". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

Political life had not yet recovered from the shock caused by the overthrow of a form of government deeply rooted in the history of the people. The newly empowered [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] was prey to wild party strife, which made the formation of a stable government difficult. The political troubles in addition to the continuing economic strife caused by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]'s economic provisions (especially [[war reparations]]) caused a fatigue in the German psyche. However, in spite of assaults, both from within and from without, the [[Weimar Republic]] survived despite its many troubles.\n\nAlmost all of the most important events in Germany in 1921 were connected with questions arising out of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, [[disarmament]], reparations, trials of war criminals, and the [[plebiscite]] in [[Upper Silesia]]\u2014questions that, from their harassing nature, kept both government and people in constant suspense and agitation.\n\n==Troubles complying with the Treaty of Versailles==\n\n===Disarmament===\n\nThe Protocol of Spa had threatened Germany with new sanctions in the form of further occupation of German territory if Germany did not continue on its schedule of war reparations. But the threat was suspended, and the matter of disarmament was referred to a conference of ministers at [[Paris]] at the end of January. This conference not only drew up a plan for Germany's reparation obligations, but also fixed eight dates for the fulfilment of all disarmament demands. The most important of these dates were for the delivery of the remaining war material (February 28), the repeal of a new [[Reichswehr]] law, with the absolute abolition of [[conscription]] for the Reich and the single [[States of Germany|states]] (March 15), the surrender of all heavy and of two-thirds of the small firearms belonging to the organizations for self-protection (March 31), the disarmament of all ships in reserve (April 30), the complete disbandment of all organizations of defense and the surrender of the remainder of their arms (June 30), and lastly (July 31), the destruction of warships in the process of construction, with the exception of those transformed with the assent of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into mercantile vessels.\n\n===War reparations===\n\nThe Paris conference of ministers, which commenced on January 24, formulated a plan by which Germany was to pay 226,000 million [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s in forty-two fixed annuities from May 1, 1921, to May 1, 1963, and in addition forty-two varying annuities each equal to 12% of German exports. This plan was communicated to the German government, along with the announcement that in case of non-fulfilment sanctions in the terms of the Spa Protocol would be applied.\n\nThis communication of the Paris conference caused intense agitation in Germany. Speaking in the Reichstag the [[List of German foreign ministers|foreign minister]], [[Walter Simons]], characterized the Paris demands as impossible to fulfill, as an infringement of the Treaty of Versailles, and as involving the economic enslavement captures of the German people. He declared in the name of the government that the proposed plan could not be regarded as a basis for further negotiations. With the exception of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], the leaders of the parliamentary groups endorsed the declaration of the government.\n\nThrough the chairman of the Paris conference, the German government were invited to send a representative on March 1 to London, to discuss the reparation question. The government accepted the invitation, but smarting from their experiences at Versailles and Spa, the German government wanted to make sure that their views would be well represented.\n\nThe German delegates had a difficult time putting effective counterproposals together due to their philosophical differences, so all of the proposals were ultimately rejected. In a later sitting [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] informed the German delegates that their proposals would not meet with serious consideration. In addition, he allowed them a fixed time to agree with the substance of the decision of the Paris conference. If they failed to agree, George threatened Germany with Allied reoccupation of [[Duisburg]], [[Ruhrort]], and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the raising of tribute from the sale price of German goods in the Allied countries, and the erection of a customs frontier on the [[Rhine]], under the supervision of the Allies.\n\nThe government protested to the [[League of Nations]], but without effect. The military occupation of the three cities mentioned took place immediately, and was extended to other places as well, while the special customs frontier on the Rhine was drawn on two dates, April 20 and May 10. On each occasion protests were made from the German side, which received no more attention than those that preceded them. On the other hand, the action of the Reparations Commission in fixing further dates for the payment of enormous sums by Germany was scarcely noticed, public attention being almost wholly centred on the approach of May 1, the date assigned for the first payment of reparations.\n\nSimultaneously the [[List of German presidents since 1919|President of the German Reich]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] issued a proclamation, countersigned by the chancellor, [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]], to the effect that the Allies had occupied areas of Germany in defiance to the Treaty of Versailles and that they would not object to outside help in the matter.\n\n===Occupied Rhineland===\n\nIn the occupied territories of the [[Rhineland]], the edicts of the occupation authorities, especially the French, led to many conflicts between them and the German administration. The German commissioner, von Stark, who had several times protested against decrees of the Inter-Allied Rhineland Commission, was threatened with expulsion by the president of the commission, and to avoid this he resigned voluntarily. His successor, the Prince of [[Hatzfeld-Wildenburg]], was only admitted after long negotiations, and on condition that he promised to abstain from all obstruction and to cooperate loyally with the Rhineland Commission. Complaints, however, of arbitrary decisions of the commission have continued to abound, especially in regard to the execution of justice and the administration of schools. Up to March 31, the cost of the occupation to Germany was 4 milliards of [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] and 7 milliards of [[German papiermark|Papiermark]] (paper mark).\n\n===Trials of war criminals===\n\nAlong with the questions of disarmament and reparation, punishment of German [[war crimes|war criminals]] was a matter that kept Germany in continual anxiety and unrest. The government attempted to fulfill the war crime obligations it had agreed to. Nine of these trials took place before the Supreme Court, from May 23 onwards. Several cases ended in an acquittal of the accused, but most were followed by imprisonment or incarceration in a fortress. A [[United Kingdom|British]] delegation headed by the solicitor-general, [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth|Sir Ernest Pollock]], attended the first trials, in which cases brought on the demand of the United Kingdom were heard. The other trials were similarly attended by a [[France|French]] or [[Belgium|Belgian]] delegation. The acquittal of General [[Karl Stenger]], who was accused by the French of having had French prisoners shot, caused the French government to recall its legal mission and the French witnesses.\n\n===Upper Silesia plebiscite===\n{{details|Upper Silesia plebiscite}}\nThe clause of the Treaty of Versailles demanding a [[plebiscite]] in [[Upper Silesia]] was next taken in hand. The German government had already declared during the negotiations in London that the possession of Upper Silesia was indispensable to Germany if she was to fulfill her obligations in regard to reparations. After some negotiation the plebiscite was fixed for March 20, and resulted in 717,122 votes being cast for Germany against 483,514 for [[Poland]], the result very different from the last 1910 census, where Poles had clear 60% majority.\n\nWith the results of the Plebiscite making the ultimate fate of Upper Silesia unclear, [[Third Silesian Uprising|fighting erupted in the province between insurgent Polish forces and German militias]]. The [[German language|Germanophone]] section of the population made strong complaints, being firmly convinced that the French division of the Upper Silesian army of occupation was favouring the insurrection by refusing to do anything.\n\nTwelve days after the start of the uprising, [[Wojciech Korfanty]] offered to take his Upper Silesian forces behind a line of demarcation, on condition that the released territory would not be occupied by German forces, but by Allied troops. It was not, however, until July 1 that the British troops arrived in Upper Silesia and began to advance in company with those of the Allies towards the former frontier. Simultaneously with this advance the Inter-Allied Commission pronounced a general amnesty for the illegal actions committed during the recent violence, with the exception of acts of revenge and cruelty. The German defense force was finally withdrawn and disbanded and quiet was restored.\n\nAs the Supreme Council was unable to come to an agreement on the partition of the Upper Silesian territory on the lines of the plebiscite, a solution was found by turning the question over to the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. Agreements between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia and appeals issued by both sides, as well as the despatch of six battalions of Allied troops and the disbandment of the local guards, contributed markedly to the pacification of the district. On the basis of the reports of a [[League of Nations]] commission and those of its experts, the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland. Poland obtained almost exactly half of the 1,950,000 inhabitants, ''viz.'', 965,000, but not quite a third of the territory, ''i.e.'', only 3,214.26&nbsp;km\u00b2 (1,255&nbsp;mi\u00b2) out of 10,950.89&nbsp;km\u00b2 (4,265&nbsp;mi\u00b2).\n\nGerman and Polish officials, under a League of Nations recommendation, agreed to come up with protections of minority interests that would last for 15 years. Special measures were threatened in case either of the two states should refuse to participate in the drawing up of such regulations, or to accept them subsequently.\n\nPolish Government had decided to give Upper Silesia considerable Autonomy with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodship Council as the executive body.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Resignation of Fehrenbach government===\n\nIn the middle of all of these troubles with the Treaty of Versailles the cabinet of [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]] resigned on May 10. In the meantime the Reparations Commission had fixed the sum of Germany's debt at 132 milliard [[German gold mark|Goldmark]], besides having stated that by May 1, when the German debt became due, a further sum of 12 milliard [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] for reconstruction of demolished industrial works was to be paid. As a kind of guarantee, the commission demanded that the gold treasure of the Reichsbank and of certain other banking-houses should be transported to the occupied territory. Before these claims could be met, they were replaced by the ultimatum of the Allied governments, which gave the German government until May 12, under threat of occupation of the Ruhr valley, to declare that they had decided unreservedly to fulfil the obligations drawn up by the commission, to accept all of its dictated guarantees, to carry out immediately and without reserve the measures prescribed in regard to disarmament, and, finally, to proceed without delay to try the war criminals.\n\n===Joseph Wirth's first government===\n\nAfter many days of trying negotiations, which at times made it seem it would be impossible to form any German government whatsoever, the [[List of German finance ministers|Minister of Finance]] of the preceding government, Dr. [[Joseph Wirth]], managed to form a coalition cabinet willing to accept the ultimatum as it stood (May 10). Members of the [[Catholic Centre Party|Centre]], Majority Socialist, and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] parties constituted the greater part of this new cabinet, in which three vacancies were left temporarily, the other appointments being as follows:\n\n*Dr. Joseph Wirth (Centre Party) \u2013 Reich chancellor and minister of finance\n*[[Gustav Bauer]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic (SPD)]]) \u2013 [[Deputy Chancellor of Germany|vice-chancellor]] and Minister of the Reich treasury\n*[[Friedrich Rosen]], [[List of German foreign ministers|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]\n*Dr. [[Georg Gradnauer]] (SPD) \u2013 [[List of German interior ministers|Minister of the Interior]]\n*[[Robert Schmidt (German politician)|Robert Schmidt]] (SPD), [[List of German economics ministers|Minister of Economics]]\n*Dr. [[Heinrich Brauns]] (Centre) \u2013 [[List of German labour ministers|Minister of Labour]]\n*Dr. [[Eugen Schiffer]] (SPD) \u2013 [[List of German justice ministers|Minister of Justice]]\n*Dr. [[Otto Gessler]] (SPD) \u2013 [[List of German defence ministers|Minister of Defense]]\n*[[Wilhelm Groener]] \u2013 [[List of German transportation ministers|Minister of Transportation]]\n*[[Johannes Giesberts]] (Centre) \u2013 [[List of German postal ministers|Minister of the Post]]\n*Dr. [[Andreas Hermes]] (Centre) \u2013 Minister of Food\n*[[Walter Rathenau]] (Democrat) \u2013 Minister of Reconstruction\n\nThe three middle parties of the Reichstag, who desired a genuine democracy, supported the new cabinet. The [[German People's Party]] also was willing on certain conditions to join the coalition and to sign the ultimatum. In the end, the majority was composed of the Centre Party, the Social Democrats, Independent Social Democrats, and certain members of the People's Party.\n\nA certain lull in the storm over the reparations question took place during the following months. The first gold milliard had been paid on August 31, and only the 33\u2153% fall in the value of the mark, which later depreciated to a still greater degree, indicated approaching peril. Although no further doubt was cast on Germany's will to pay, the Allies failed to repeal the military sanctions of March 9. The trade sanctions came to an end on September 30, but not without a burdensome commission of contract having been instituted in their place.\n\nIn order to further Germany's work of reconstruction in the north of [[France]], the two ministers, [[Walther Rathenau]] and [[Louis Loucheur]], conferred several times at [[Wiesbaden]] in August and September, in regard to the delivery by Germany of the necessary material. Germany agreed to deliveries that were to be credited as payment, but were not to exceed the value of 7 milliard [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] by May 1, 1926.\n\nThe growing sense that the Reich would never be able to meet their reparation obligations led to bankers using private foreign credit at the disposal of the Reich. The reparation payments discharged in this manner were to be credited to industry for taxes, to amounts to be stated at a later date. This plan was well received at first. But certain tendencies that subsequently manifested themselves among the great industrials led to failure of this push to use foreign credit. To meet its debt, the German government had also tried to negotiate a loan with a foreign banking-house of \u00a325,000,000, and had been rebuffed with a pertinent reference to the reparation burden. Thereupon the government declared to the [[Reparations Commission]] in December that the two following instalments, due on January 15 and February 15, of 500,000,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] and about 250,000,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] respectively, could only be paid in part, and a delay was requested. Thus at the end of the year the problem of reparations had again become acute.\n\n===Joseph Wirth's second government===\n\nAfter the official publication of this decision, Chancellor Wirth, considering that his task had been rendered impossible, resigned with the whole of his cabinet. After vain attempts to reorganize the cabinet on a broader basis by including members of the German People's Party, the president of the republic again entrusted Wirth with the formation of the cabinet, a task he soon accomplished (October 26). Wirth's 2nd cabinet included:\n\n*Wirth (Centre) \u2013 chancellor and acting minister of foreign affairs\n*Bauer (SPD) \u2013 Vice-chancellor and Minister of the treasury\n*[[Adolf K\u00f6ster]] (SPD) \u2013 minister of the interior\n*Dr. Heinrich Brauns (Centre) \u2013 Minister of Labour\n*Dr. Andreas Hermes (Centre) \u2013 Minister of Food Supply and Agriculture, and Acting Minister of Finance, \n*Dr. Otto Gessler (DDP) \u2013 Minister of defense\n*Wilhelm Groener \u2013 Minister of Transport and Communication\n*Johannes Giesberts (Centre) \u2013 Minister of Post\n*Robert Schmidt (SPD) \u2013 Minister of Economy\n*Dr. [[Gustav Radbruch]] (SPD) \u2013 Minister of Justice\n\nA vote of confidence in the new government was passed by 230 votes to 132, the minority consisting of the two parties of the right and the Communists.\n\n==State of German finances==\n\nSharp criticism was levelled in Parliament and in the press against the extreme slowness with which long overdue taxes were being collected. The slowness in tax collection was partly attributable to the overworked condition of revenue and taxation officials. The sensational drop in the value of the mark due to [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] made the financial position still more deplorable, and produced at the end of the year an unprecedented rise in prices. It also led to a positive inundation of the large western towns with buyers from the countries with high exchange. This resulted in Germany being drained of goods without receiving a fair equivalent. The stimulus given to trade and industry, though it certainly reduced unemployment to a minimum, was no compensation, because the export of manufactures involved a continual decrease of German assets. Eventually, all of these factors would lead to the mark being devalued to as little as 4.2{{e|12}} mark to the [[United States dollar]].\n\n==Communist rising and right-wing violence==\n\nIn March, there was a Communist rising in central Germany, accompanied by violence, murder, and pillage. [[Max H\u00f6lz]], the leader of the insurrection was captured and tried before a special court in Berlin, which sentenced him to imprisonment for life and loss of civic rights. The rest of those involved in the insurrection were also tried by special courts and condemned to imprisonment for varying periods. A large proportion of those who took a subordinate part in the insurrection were amnestied.\n\nOn the other hand, the supporters of a royalist and military system, including 40,000 ex-officers of the old army as well as a relatively large number of landowners, higher officials, and the middle classes in the towns, did not openly rise against the republic. However, their insults to the new black, red, and gold German flag and bitter attacks on the representatives of the republic in the press and in public speeches became more frequent. Two political murders that appeared to be a product of this spirit showed that the political temperature had risen. In June, [[Karl Gareis]], the leader of the local [[Independent Socialist Party (Bavaria)|Independent Socialist Party]], was murdered at [[Munich]], and on August 25 [[Matthias Erzberger]], the former minister of finance, was murdered.\n\nThe murderer of Gareis could not be found, but it was widely taken for granted that the murder was a political act. Erzberger's murderers were identified as two young men, apparently nationalist fanatics.\n\nBoth murders, especially that of Erzberger, created an extremely bitter feeling among the working classes. Public demonstrations were held in favour of the republic, and both Socialist parties took steps to draw the attention of the chancellor to the dangers of the situation, and to demand energetic measures against those who had organized the agitation and who were to be considered morally responsible for the recent crimes.\n\nOn August 29, the president issued a decree, based on [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the German constitution, authorizing an anti-[[sedition]] act that would last for at least 14 days. The decree inspired opposition on all sides, and it was repealed on December 24 by a vote of the Reichstag after being in force barely four months.\n\n==Foreign affairs==\n\nSome important agreements and treaties with foreign states were concluded during the year. On May 6 an economic agreement was concluded with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]], and a German delegation under Professor [[Kurt Wiedenfeld]] was sent to [[Moscow]]. Peace with the [[United States]] was signed in [[Berlin]] on August 25, and was ratified by the German Reichstag on September 30 and by the American [[United States Senate|Senate]] on October 19. A treaty with [[China]], proclaiming a state of peace between the two countries, was made on May 20. A treaty was concluded with [[Switzerland]] on December 3, which set up a court of arbitration to deal with disputes between the two countries. A series of economic treaties with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Italy]], and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] must be added, as well as a treaty of preference with [[Portugal]]. An agreement with the United Kingdom concerning the partial restoration of German private property was concluded on January 12.\n\n==Births==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[21 January]] \u2013 [[Andreas Ostler]], bobsledder (died [[1988 in Germany|1988]])\n* [[5 February]] \u2013 [[Ken Adam]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3561380/Ken-Adam-the-man-who-drew-the-Cold-War.html|title=Ken Adam: the man who drew the Cold War|first=Horatia|last=Harrod|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 September 2008}}</ref> English [[production designer]] (died [[2016 in the United Kingdom|2016]])<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35780260|title=Sir Ken Adam, James Bond production designer, dies aged 95|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n* [[27 April]] \u2013 [[Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff]], German television presenter (died [[1998 in Austria|1998]])\n* [[9 May]] \u2013 [[Sophie Scholl]], German [[White Rose]] resistance member (died [[1943 in Germany|1943]])\n* [[12 May]] \u2013 [[Joseph Beuys]], German artist, teacher and activist (died [[1986 in Germany|1986]])\n* [[14 May]] \u2013 [[Mordechai Breuer]], [[Israel]]i biblical scholar and author (died [[2007 in Israel|2007]])\n* [[12 June]] \u2013 [[Heinz Weiss]], German actor (died [[2010 in Germany|2010]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Deaths==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\n* [[1 January]] \u2013 [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], politician, [[Chancellor of Germany]] (born 1856)\n* [[11 April]] \u2013 [[Auguste Victoria]], the former Empress of Germany (born 1858)\n* [[4 June]] \u2013 [[Ludwig Knorr]], German chemist (born 1859)\n* [[2 October]] \u2013 [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|William II]], the former king of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born 1848)\n* [[18 October]] \u2013 [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]], the former king of [[Bavaria]] (born 1845)\n* [[20 December]] \u2013 [[Julius Richard Petri]], German microbiologist (born [[1852]])\n{{Germany year nav}}\n{{Year in Europe|1921}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:1921 in Germany| ]]\n[[Category:Years of the 20th century in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{essay|date=February 2011}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n}}\n{{Year in Germany|1921}}\nEvents in the year '''1921 in [[Germany]]'''.\n\n==Incumbents==\n\n===National level===\n[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]]\n*[[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]])\n[[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]\n*[[Constantin Fehrenbach]] ([[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]]) to 4 May, then from 10 May [[Joseph Wirth]] (Centre)\n\n==Overview==\nThe year 1921, like every year between [[World War I]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power, was for [[Germany]] one of gloom, redeemed only by a few bright spots. Political life had not yet recovered from the shock caused by the overthrow of a form of government deeply rooted in the history of the people. The newly empowered [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] was prey to wild party strife, which made the formation of a stable government difficult. The political troubles in addition to the continuing economic strife caused by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]'s economic provisions (especially [[war reparations]]) caused a fatigue in the German psyche. However, in spite of assaults, both from within and from without, the [[Weimar Republic]] survived despite its many troubles.\n\nAlmost all of the most important events in Germany in 1921 were connected with questions arising out of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, [[disarmament]], reparations, trials of war criminals, and the [[plebiscite]] in [[Upper Silesia]]\u2014questions that, from their harassing nature, kept both government and people in constant suspense and agitation.\n\n==Troubles complying with the Treaty of Versailles==\n\n===Disarmament===\n\nThe Protocol of Spa had threatened Germany with new sanctions in the form of further occupation of German territory if Germany did not continue on its schedule of war reparations. But the threat was suspended, and the matter of disarmament was referred to a conference of ministers at [[Paris]] at the end of January. This conference not only drew up a plan for Germany's reparation obligations, but also fixed eight dates for the fulfilment of all disarmament demands. The most important of these dates were for the delivery of the remaining war material (February 28), the repeal of a new [[Reichswehr]] law, with the absolute abolition of [[conscription]] for the Reich and the single [[States of Germany|states]] (March 15), the surrender of all heavy and of two-thirds of the small firearms belonging to the organizations for self-protection (March 31), the disarmament of all ships in reserve (April 30), the complete disbandment of all organizations of defense and the surrender of the remainder of their arms (June 30), and lastly (July 31), the destruction of warships in the process of construction, with the exception of those transformed with the assent of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into mercantile vessels.\n\n===War reparations===\n\nThe Paris conference of ministers, which commenced on January 24, formulated a plan by which Germany was to pay 226,000 million [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s in forty-two fixed annuities from May 1, 1921, to May 1, 1963, and in addition forty-two varying annuities each equal to 12% of German exports. This plan was communicated to the German government, along with the announcement that in case of non-fulfilment sanctions in the terms of the Spa Protocol would be applied.\n\nThis communication of the Paris conference caused intense agitation in Germany. Speaking in the Reichstag the [[List of German foreign ministers|foreign minister]], [[Walter Simons]], characterized the Paris demands as impossible to fulfill, as an infringement of the Treaty of Versailles, and as involving the economic enslavement captures of the German people. He declared in the name of the government that the proposed plan could not be regarded as a basis for further negotiations. With the exception of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], the leaders of the parliamentary groups endorsed the declaration of the government.\n\nThrough the chairman of the Paris conference, the German government were invited to send a representative on March 1 to London, to discuss the reparation question. The government accepted the invitation, but smarting from their experiences at Versailles and Spa, the German government wanted to make sure that their views would be well represented.\n\nThe German delegates had a difficult time putting effective counterproposals together due to their philosophical differences, so all of the proposals were ultimately rejected. In a later sitting [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] informed the German delegates that their proposals would not meet with serious consideration. In addition, he allowed them a fixed time to agree with the substance of the decision of the Paris conference. If they failed to agree, George threatened Germany with Allied reoccupation of [[Duisburg]], [[Ruhrort]], and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the raising of tribute from the sale price of German goods in the Allied countries, and the erection of a customs frontier on the [[Rhine]], under the supervision of the Allies.\n\nThe government protested to the [[League of Nations]], but without effect. The military occupation of the three cities mentioned took place immediately, and was extended to other places as well, while the special customs frontier on the Rhine was drawn on two dates, April 20 and May 10. On each occasion protests were made from the German side, which received no more attention than those that preceded them. On the other hand, the action of the Reparations Commission in fixing further dates for the payment of enormous sums by Germany was scarcely noticed, public attention being almost wholly centred on the approach of May 1, the date assigned for the first payment of reparations.\n\nSimultaneously the [[List of German presidents since 1919|President of the German Reich]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] issued a proclamation, countersigned by the chancellor, [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]], to the effect that the Allies had occupied areas of Germany in defiance to the Treaty of Versailles and that they would not object to outside help in the matter.\n\n===Occupied Rhineland===\n\nIn the occupied territories of the [[Rhineland]], the edicts of the occupation authorities, especially the French, led to many conflicts between them and the German administration. The German commissioner, von Stark, who had several times protested against decrees of the Inter-Allied Rhineland Commission, was threatened with expulsion by the president of the commission, and to avoid this he resigned voluntarily. His successor, the Prince of [[Hatzfeld-Wildenburg]], was only admitted after long negotiations, and on condition that he promised to abstain from all obstruction and to cooperate loyally with the Rhineland Commission. Complaints, however, of arbitrary decisions of the commission have continued to abound, especially in regard to the execution of justice and the administration of schools. Up to March 31, the cost of the occupation to Germany was 4 milliards of [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] and 7 milliards of [[German papiermark|Papiermark]] (paper mark).\n\n===Trials of war criminals===\n\nAlong with the questions of disarmament and reparation, punishment of German [[war crimes|war criminals]] was a matter that kept Germany in continual anxiety and unrest. The government attempted to fulfill the war crime obligations it had agreed to. Nine of these trials took place before the Supreme Court, from May 23 onwards. Several cases ended in an acquittal of the accused, but most were followed by imprisonment or incarceration in a fortress. A [[United Kingdom|British]] delegation headed by the solicitor-general, [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth|Sir Ernest Pollock]], attended the first trials, in which cases brought on the demand of the United Kingdom were heard. The other trials were similarly attended by a [[France|French]] or [[Belgium|Belgian]] delegation. The acquittal of General [[Karl Stenger]], who was accused by the French of having had French prisoners shot, caused the French government to recall its legal mission and the French witnesses.\n\n===Upper Silesia plebiscite===\n{{details|Upper Silesia plebiscite}}\nThe clause of the Treaty of Versailles demanding a [[plebiscite]] in [[Upper Silesia]] was next taken in hand. The German government had already declared during the negotiations in London that the possession of Upper Silesia was indispensable to Germany if she was to fulfill her obligations in regard to reparations. After some negotiation the plebiscite was fixed for March 20, and resulted in 717,122 votes being cast for Germany against 483,514 for [[Poland]], the result very different from the last 1910 census, where Poles had clear 60% majority.\n\nWith the results of the Plebiscite making the ultimate fate of Upper Silesia unclear, [[Third Silesian Uprising|fighting erupted in the province between insurgent Polish forces and German militias]]. The [[German language|Germanophone]] section of the population made strong complaints, being firmly convinced that the French division of the Upper Silesian army of occupation was favouring the insurrection by refusing to do anything.\n\nTwelve days after the start of the uprising, [[Wojciech Korfanty]] offered to take his Upper Silesian forces behind a line of demarcation, on condition that the released territory would not be occupied by German forces, but by Allied troops. It was not, however, until July 1 that the British troops arrived in Upper Silesia and began to advance in company with those of the Allies towards the former frontier. Simultaneously with this advance the Inter-Allied Commission pronounced a general amnesty for the illegal actions committed during the recent violence, with the exception of acts of revenge and cruelty. The German defense force was finally withdrawn and disbanded and quiet was restored.\n\nAs the Supreme Council was unable to come to an agreement on the partition of the Upper Silesian territory on the lines of the plebiscite, a solution was found by turning the question over to the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. Agreements between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia and appeals issued by both sides, as well as the despatch of six battalions of Allied troops and the disbandment of the local guards, contributed markedly to the pacification of the district. On the basis of the reports of a [[League of Nations]] commission and those of its experts, the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland. Poland obtained almost exactly half of the 1,950,000 inhabitants, ''viz.'', 965,000, but not quite a third of the territory, ''i.e.'', only 3,214.26&nbsp;km\u00b2 (1,255&nbsp;mi\u00b2) out of 10,950.89&nbsp;km\u00b2 (4,265&nbsp;mi\u00b2).\n\nGerman and Polish officials, under a League of Nations recommendation, agreed to come up with protections of minority interests that would last for 15 years. Special measures were threatened in case either of the two states should refuse to participate in the drawing up of such regulations, or to accept them subsequently.\n\nPolish Government had decided to give Upper Silesia considerable Autonomy with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodship Council as the executive body.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Resignation of Fehrenbach government===\n\nIn the middle of all of these troubles with the Treaty of Versailles the cabinet of [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]] resigned on May 10. In the meantime the Reparations Commission had fixed the sum of Germany's debt at 132 milliard [[German gold mark|Goldmark]], besides having stated that by May 1, when the German debt became due, a further sum of 12 milliard [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] for reconstruction of demolished industrial works was to be paid. As a kind of guarantee, the commission demanded that the gold treasure of the Reichsbank and of certain other banking-houses should be transported to the occupied territory. Before these claims could be met, they were replaced by the ultimatum of the Allied governments, which gave the German government until May 12, under threat of occupation of the Ruhr valley, to declare that they had decided unreservedly to fulfil the obligations drawn up by the commission, to accept all of its dictated guarantees, to carry out immediately and without reserve the measures prescribed in regard to disarmament, and, finally, to proceed without delay to try the war criminals.\n\n===Joseph Wirth's first government===\n\nAfter many days of trying negotiations, which at times made it seem it would be impossible to form any German government whatsoever, the [[List of German finance ministers|Minister of Finance]] of the preceding government, Dr. [[Joseph Wirth]], managed to form a coalition cabinet willing to accept the ultimatum as it stood (May 10).

Eventually, all of these factors would lead to the mark being devalued to as little as 4.2{{e|12}} mark to the [[United States dollar]].\n\n==Communist rising and right-wing violence==\n\nIn March, there was a Communist rising in central Germany, accompanied by violence, murder, and pillage. [[Max H\u00f6lz]], the leader of the insurrection was captured and tried before a special court in Berlin, which sentenced him to imprisonment for life and loss of civic rights. The rest of those involved in the insurrection were also tried by special courts and condemned to imprisonment for varying periods. A large proportion of those who took a subordinate part in the insurrection were amnestied.\n\nOn the other hand, the supporters of a royalist and military system, including 40,000 ex-officers of the old army as well as a relatively large number of landowners, higher officials, and the middle classes in the towns, did not openly rise against the republic. However, their insults to the new black, red, and gold German flag and bitter attacks on the representatives of the republic in the press and in public speeches became more frequent. Two political murders that appeared to be a product of this spirit showed that the political temperature had risen. In June, [[Karl Gareis]], the leader of the local [[Independent Socialist Party (Bavaria)|Independent Socialist Party]], was murdered at [[Munich]], and on August 25 [[Matthias Erzberger]], the former minister of finance, was murdered.\n\nThe murderer of Gareis could not be found, but it was widely taken for granted that the murder was a political act. Erzberger's murderers were identified as two young men, apparently nationalist fanatics.\n\nBoth murders, especially that of Erzberger, created an extremely bitter feeling among the working classes. Public demonstrations were held in favour of the republic, and both Socialist parties took steps to draw the attention of the chancellor to the dangers of the situation, and to demand energetic measures against those who had organized the agitation and who were to be considered morally responsible for the recent crimes.\n\nOn August 29, the president issued a decree, based on [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the German constitution, authorizing an anti-[[sedition]] act that would last for at least 14 days. The decree inspired opposition on all sides, and it was repealed on December 24 by a vote of the Reichstag after being in force barely four months.\n\n==Foreign affairs==\n\nSome important agreements and treaties with foreign states were concluded during the year. On May 6 an economic agreement was concluded with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]], and a German delegation under Professor [[Kurt Wiedenfeld]] was sent to [[Moscow]]. Peace with the [[United States]] was signed in [[Berlin]] on August 25, and was ratified by the German Reichstag on September 30 and by the American [[United States Senate|Senate]] on October 19. A treaty with [[China]], proclaiming a state of peace between the two countries, was made on May 20. A treaty was concluded with [[Switzerland]] on December 3, which set up a court of arbitration to deal with disputes between the two countries. A series of economic treaties with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Italy]], and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] must be added, as well as a treaty of preference with [[Portugal]]. An agreement with the United Kingdom concerning the partial restoration of German private property was concluded on January 12.\n\n==Births==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[21 January]] \u2013 [[Andreas Ostler]], bobsledder (died [[1988 in Germany|1988]])\n* [[5 February]] \u2013 [[Ken Adam]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3561380/Ken-Adam-the-man-who-drew-the-Cold-War.html|title=Ken Adam: the man who drew the Cold War|first=Horatia|last=Harrod|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 September 2008}}</ref> English [[production designer]] (died [[2016 in the United Kingdom|2016]])<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35780260|title=Sir Ken Adam, James Bond production designer, dies aged 95|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n* [[27 April]] \u2013 [[Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff]], German television presenter (died [[1998 in Austria|1998]])\n* [[9 May]] \u2013 [[Sophie Scholl]], German [[White Rose]] resistance member (died [[1943 in Germany|1943]])\n* [[12 May]] \u2013 [[Joseph Beuys]], German artist, teacher and activist (died [[1986 in Germany|1986]])\n* [[14 May]] \u2013 [[Mordechai Breuer]], [[Israel]]i biblical scholar and author (died [[2007 in Israel|2007]])\n* [[12 June]] \u2013 [[Heinz Weiss]], German actor (died [[2010 in Germany|2010]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Deaths==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\n* [[1 January]] \u2013 [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], politician, [[Chancellor of Germany]] (born 1856)\n* [[11 April]] \u2013 [[Auguste Victoria]], the former Empress of Germany (born 1858)\n* [[4 June]] \u2013 [[Ludwig Knorr]], German chemist (born 1859)\n* [[2 October]] \u2013 [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|William II]], the former king of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born 1848)\n* [[18 October]] \u2013 [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]], the former king of [[Bavaria]] (born 1845)\n* [[20 December]] \u2013 [[Julius Richard Petri]], German microbiologist (born [[1852]])\n{{Germany year nav}}\n{{Year in Europe|1921}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:1921 in Germany| ]]\n[[Category:Years of the 20th century in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Robert Schmidt (politician)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_in_Germany"}
