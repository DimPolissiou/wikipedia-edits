{"title_page": "Talmudical Academy of Baltimore", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=May 2011}}\n{{tone|date=November 2015}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Talmudical Academy of Baltimore''' or '''T.A.''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d7\u05e4\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd''') is a K\u201312 [[yeshiva]] founded in 1917. Its present campus, located at 4445 [[Old Court Road]], includes an elementary school building, middle and high school building, two gymnasiums, a dormitory, a computer lab, and two study halls which double as prayer sanctuaries. They have recently completed a twenty-two million dollar campus expansion<sup>[[https://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/print.php?ARTICLE_ID=111480 8]]</sup> which includes an Early Childhood Center, and a new high school building, which includes a gym, classrooms and [[beis medrash]].<ref>http://talmudicalacademy.org/campus-expansion/expanding_horizons/</ref>\n\n==History==\nTalmudical Academy of Baltimore (T.A.) was founded in 1917 as Baltimore Parochial Hebrew School by Rav Avraham Nachman Schwartz.<ref>http://personal.stevens.edu/~llevine/abraham_n_schwartz.pdf</ref>\nThe first enrolled student was Rabbi Dr. Zalman Naftali Skaist (born 1911), who was to become a noted pioneer in [[American Jews|American Jewish]] education. T.A. was located on Cottage Avenue until a fire caused by one of the custodians destroyed the building.<ref>http://jewishtimes.com/58704/58704/news/</ref> The [[Yeshiva]] then moved to its present location on Old Court.\n\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Secular===\nThe Elementary and Middle School curricula try to include all the basic studies: English, Math, Social Studies and Science. The High School curriculum includes Algebra (1&2), Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, World History, American History, English, and Jewish History (1&2). [[Advanced Placement]] courses that TA has offered in the past include Physics, American History, European History, and English Literature. Seniors may optionally take college courses for English 101 and Psychology 101 provided by [[Baltimore City Community College|Baltimore City Community Community College (BCCC)]]\n\n===Religious===\nTalmud study begins in 5th grade at an introductory level. Talmudic study in earnest begins in 8th grade with its division into Bekius and Iyyun. Tractates that are studied with the Bekius method include [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)]], [[Sotah]], [[Ta'anit (Talmud)]], [[Megillah (Talmud)]] and others. Shorter Tractates are usually chosen. Unlike many other [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]-Style Yeshivas, TA does not have a set cycle of Tractates that it studies, rather every year the new Tractate is selected in a Faculty meeting. [[Mishna]] is studied until 5th grade. The learning of [[Tanach]] is encouraged by most Rabbis on the Faculty, though it is not a primary subject. Most set aside time in the morning for the study of [[Halacha]]. This is generally, however, a mere formality.\n\n==Beis Medrash==\nUntil 1998, a Bais Medrash-level [[shiur]] was given by Rabbi [[Yosef Rottenberg]]. When he became too ill to continue giving the shiur, the Bais Medrash was discontinued. At the end of 2004, HaRav [[Yisrael Asia]] was brought in to lead the Beis Medrash, which he did for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 school years. During the 2005/06 year, Rav [[Avrohom Notis]] also gave shiur to the Beis Medrash. In 2006\u201307, the Bais Medrash was resurrected yet again by Rabbi [[Bentzion Mellman]] and Rabbi [[Dovid Hoffman]]. Rabbi Mellman acted as [[Rosh Beis Medrash]] and Instructor of Iyyun (a slower, more in-depth Talmudic analysis) and Rabbi Hoffman as the \"Sho'el u-Maishiv\" (study-hall mentor) and Instructor of B'kius (a faster, less in-depth method of Talmudic study). The inaugural Class consisted of seven members; however three more students joined the Program in the middle of the year. The program continued through the 2008\u201309 year, but has been discontinued for the time being.\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\nT.A. used to have a varsity basketball team. They were called the Fighting Davids in the '70s and '80s. In the '90s they became the Tigers.\nThe team reached its zenith in the [[Tamir Goodman]] era, which was in the late '90s and early 2000s. The team name was changed to the \"Thunder\".\n\nTorah Youth Association was loosely connected with T.A. The Association, headed by Gavi Cohn, and continues to serve as an outlet for teenage boys to play sports and hang out in an environment that fully agrees with Jewish Orthodox social customs. The T.Y.A. sponsored a flag football league near T.A. which was very popular. The association also hosted tennis and pizza nights on Saturday Night, as well as a yearly Super Bowl Party. T.Y.A. also hosted shabbatons at the [[Pearlstone Center]], in Western Maryland, as well as [[Camp Shoresh]].\n\nT.A. has always been the site of many informal sports and other leisurely activities, such as the (now defunct) chess club, debate club, and the 'tag club' of the mid-1990s. There was a short-lived varsity baseball team, led by [[Paul Blitz]], a U.S. Army Reserve soldier.\n\nIn the late 1970s, National Football League player Mike Collier briefly served as gym teacher.\n \nA Mishmar program is currently available for middle school students. 6th and 7th grade Mishmar starts after school ends at 5:15.\n\n==Notable visitors==\nT.A. has hosted a number of famous Roshei Yeshiva, and other scholars of repute. The list includes: Rav [[Mendel Blachman]] (Ra\"m at [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]), Rav [[Yechezkel Yaakovson]], [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Sha'alvim]], Rav [[Shmuel Kamenetsky]] ([[Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia]]), Rav [[Aharon Lopiansky]] (Yeshiva of Silver Spring), Rav [[Daniel Mechanic]] ([[Aish HaTorah|Aish]]- Discovery), Rav [[Reuven Feinstein]], Rabbi Zeleg Pliskin, Rabbi [[Yehuda Peretz]], [[Steven Hill]], Rabbi [[Yerachmiel Millstein]], Rav Noach Orlowek ''mashgiach ruchani'' Yeshivas [[Torah Ore]], Rabbi Aharon Schechter, Rabbi Asher Zeleg Rubinstein (Rosh Yeshiva, Yeshivas Torah Simcha), among many others.

As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model: Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable |publisher=Danish Energy Agency|p=13last=|first=|date=|website= |access-date=19 April 2020 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200210095624/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] is also widely used. This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Gross energy consumption in Denmark (PJ), 1980\u20132018<ref>Source except where noted: {{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |title=Key Figures from DEA's Preliminary Energy Statistics 2015 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418222149/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Unit: [[petajoules]] (PJ)\n!'''1980'''\n!'''1990'''\n!'''2000'''\n!'''2005'''\n!'''2010'''\n!'''2012'''\n!'''2013'''\n!'''2014'''\n!'''2015'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\" />\n!'''2016'''<ref>{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2016 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200131232009/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n!'''2017'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2017 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418223900/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n!'''2018'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2018 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418220633/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''819'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''839'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''850'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''782'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''763'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''755'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''760'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''770'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''772'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''781'''\n|-\n|Oil\n| align=\"right\" |546\n| align=\"right\" |355\n| align=\"right\" |376\n| align=\"right\" |352\n| align=\"right\" |312\n| align=\"right\" |289\n| align=\"right\" |278\n| align=\"right\" |276\n| align=\"right\" |284\n| align=\"right\" |280\n| align=\"right\" |286\n| align=\"right\" |288\n|-\n|Natural gas\n| align=\"right\" |0\n| align=\"right\" |82\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |176\n| align=\"right\" |149\n| align=\"right\" |138\n| align=\"right\" |127\n| align=\"right\" |133\n| align=\"right\" |131\n| align=\"right\" |125\n| align=\"right\" |121\n|-\n|Coal{{efn|name=coke|Including [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for 1980 and 2015\u20132018.}}\n| align=\"right\" |241\n| align=\"right\" |327\n| align=\"right\" |175\n| align=\"right\" |166\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |146\n| align=\"right\" |143\n| align=\"right\" |137\n| align=\"right\" |108\n| align=\"right\" |116\n| align=\"right\" |92\n| align=\"right\" |98\n|-\n|Waste, non-renewable\n| align=\"right\" |5\n| align=\"right\" |8\n| align=\"right\" |14\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |16\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n|-\n|'''Renewable energy'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''22'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''48'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''81'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''123'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''163'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''180'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''186'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''196'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''219'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''225'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''252'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''257'''\n|}\n\nRenewable-energy consumption increased more than elevenfold from {{convert|22|PJ|TWh}} in 1980 to {{convert|257|PJ|TWh|abbr=on}} in 2018.<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\" /> Whilst renewable-energy consumption was rising between 1990 and 2013, gross energy consumption fell by 7%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Publikationer/dk_model_revideret.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable.

The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017<ref name=\"2018 report\" />\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production. [[Biofuel]]s (wood, straw and [[biogas]]) and the biodegradable part of waste provided the second-largest RE source at 18.5% of national generation. [[Solar power]] has grown significantly in recent years from a low base and provides a further 2.7% share. [[Hydroelectricity]] provided just 0.1% of net national generation, but the country maintains strong links to its neighboring countries large hydroelectric reserves.

Total renewable electricity generation grew from 10.4 TWh in 2007 to 17.6 TWh by 2014, a rise of 69%. Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website. The site illustrates wind and power production, electricity imports and exports, and the contribution made by CHP plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production.

Offshore wind power has been growing in importance, rising from 19.1% of total wind production in 2007 to 34.5% of production by 2014. Denmark was the world's leading windpower country in 2014 by percentage of demand coverage at 39% of Danish electricity consumption.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/VE-produktion/Sider/Vind.aspx|title=Wind power|website=energinet.dk|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAmbitious plans for future development include increasing production from the 13.1 TWh produced in 2014 to 23.3 TWh by 2024, which would raise demand coverage from 39% to 61% over the period.<ref name=\":8\" /> Offshore and nearshore windpower is expected to grow quicker than land based wind power to reach almost parity with land based production by 2024 (49%).<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDenmark often produces more electricity from windpower than the entire country requires and will export it for sale or for storage in hydroelectric dams in Norway and Sweden. Occasionally electricity prices turn negative for producers when there is a glut of electricity production and lack of demand abroad as well. One result of this has been the growth of electric boilers being installed in district heating plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/energinet/126/|title=Wind power to combat climate change|website=www.e-pages.dk|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref> When there is an excess of electricity the plants can use cheap electricity to heat the hot water instead of finite bio or fossil fuels. As wind production rises the problem of too much electricity being generated will also give rise to new challenges and solutions. Electric heating and cooling can also be used in the form of more efficient [[heat pump]]s to mop up excess electricity supply. The electricity sector will in effect expand into the heating and cooling sector to displace current energy sources.\n\n=== Renewable thermal ===\n{{Image frame|width=280|align=right|pos=bottom|content=<div style=\"padding-top: 12px;\">'''Renewable thermal net electricity generation (GWh) 2007-2014.'''</div> <div style=\"margin: 10px 20px -40px -50px; font-size: 80%;\">{{ #invoke:Chart | bar-chart   | width = 320   | height = 300 | group 1 = 3192 : 3257: 3029 : 4176 : 3851 : 3935: 3996 : 3871   | colors = #009a39       | group names =   | units suffix = _MW   | x legends = 2007 : 2008 : 2009 : 2010 : 2011 :  2012  : 2013 : 2014   }}</div>|caption= Renewable thermal net electricity generation 2007-2014.<ref name=\"Danish renewable electricity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Tidligere-aars-miljoerapporter/Sider/default.aspx| title= Energinet.dk / Previous environmental reports.}}</ref>}}RE thermal generation includes electricity generated from biofuels and electricity generated from the fraction of waste that is [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]].

Overall about 2.6% of national electricity was generated by RE generation from waste.<ref name=\":103\"/> Denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat, most of it is produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad. There are 28 waste incineration plants in the country. The waste powered CHP plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production. Only the carbon neutral biodegradable part of waste is classified as renewable energy generation which was defined as 55 percent of total waste from 2011 (in 2009 it was 58.8 percent).<ref name=\":103\"/> Total waste provided 20 percent of district heating generation and between 4 and 5 percent of electricity generation in the country.<ref name=\":9\" /> Energy production from waste over the next ten years is expected to remain at similar levels, new pre treatments of waste may however be developed.\n\n'''Biogas.'''\n\nBiogas generation has been rising steadily from a low base and reached 447 GWh of electricity production in 2014 contributing about 1.5% of Denmarks electricity. Approximately 75% of biogas generating plants are 3 MW or smaller in size which numbered approximately 120 plants in 2015.<ref name=\":103\"/> A further 15 larger CHP plants account for the remaining approximately 25% of biogas consumption and co-fire biogas, mostly with natural gas. The largest source of [[Biogas]] is from manure, other sources include water treatment plants and landfill sites. Many of the smaller plants are located on farms and or other sources of biogas. Smaller biogas plants tend not to contribute heat to district heating networks. Denmark intends to increase production and use of biogas from {{convert|4|PJ|TWh}} consumption in 2015 to {{convert|17|PJ|TWh}} by 2020 with the goal of using 50% of manure in the country.<ref name=\":103\"/> Most of the new biogas is likely to be injected directly into the gas system and used for industry and transport.\n\n'''Biomass.'''\n\n[[Biomass]] provides the largest share of renewable energy in Denmark when considering the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined.

Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model: Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable |publisher=Danish Energy Agency|p=13last=|first=|date=|website= |access-date=19 April 2020 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200210095624/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] is also widely used. This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Gross energy consumption in Denmark (PJ), 1980\u20132018<ref>Source except where noted: {{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |title=Key Figures from DEA's Preliminary Energy Statistics 2015 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418222149/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Unit: [[petajoules]] (PJ)\n!'''1980'''\n!'''1990'''\n!'''2000'''\n!'''2005'''\n!'''2010'''\n!'''2012'''\n!'''2013'''\n!'''2014'''\n!'''2015'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\" />\n!'''2016'''<ref>{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2016 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200131232009/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n!'''2017'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2017 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418223900/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n!'''2018'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2018 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418220633/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''819'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''839'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''850'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''782'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''763'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''755'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''760'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''770'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''772'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''781'''\n|-\n|Oil\n| align=\"right\" |546\n| align=\"right\" |355\n| align=\"right\" |376\n| align=\"right\" |352\n| align=\"right\" |312\n| align=\"right\" |289\n| align=\"right\" |278\n| align=\"right\" |276\n| align=\"right\" |284\n| align=\"right\" |280\n| align=\"right\" |286\n| align=\"right\" |288\n|-\n|Natural gas\n| align=\"right\" |0\n| align=\"right\" |82\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |176\n| align=\"right\" |149\n| align=\"right\" |138\n| align=\"right\" |127\n| align=\"right\" |133\n| align=\"right\" |131\n| align=\"right\" |125\n| align=\"right\" |121\n|-\n|Coal{{efn|name=coke|Including [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for 1980 and 2015\u20132018.}}\n| align=\"right\" |241\n| align=\"right\" |327\n| align=\"right\" |175\n| align=\"right\" |166\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |146\n| align=\"right\" |143\n| align=\"right\" |137\n| align=\"right\" |108\n| align=\"right\" |116\n| align=\"right\" |92\n| align=\"right\" |98\n|-\n|Waste, non-renewable\n| align=\"right\" |5\n| align=\"right\" |8\n| align=\"right\" |14\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |16\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n|-\n|'''Renewable energy'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''22'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''48'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''81'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''123'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''163'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''180'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''186'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''196'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''219'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''225'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''252'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''257'''\n|}\n\nRenewable-energy consumption increased more than elevenfold from {{convert|22|PJ|TWh}} in 1980 to {{convert|257|PJ|TWh|abbr=on}} in 2018.<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\" /> Whilst renewable-energy consumption was rising between 1990 and 2013, gross energy consumption fell by 7%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Publikationer/dk_model_revideret.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable.

The figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use, there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000.

The heating and cooling sector (also known as the thermal sector) includes domestic heating and air conditioning, industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally. The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017<ref name=\"2018 report\" />\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production.

Total renewable electricity generation grew from 10.4 TWh in 2007 to 17.6 TWh by 2014, a rise of 69%. Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website. The site illustrates wind and power production, electricity imports and exports, and the contribution made by CHP plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production.

Overall about 2.6% of national electricity was generated by RE generation from waste.<ref name=\":103\"/> Denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat, most of it is produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad. There are 28 waste incineration plants in the country. The waste powered CHP plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production. Only the carbon neutral biodegradable part of waste is classified as renewable energy generation which was defined as 55 percent of total waste from 2011 (in 2009 it was 58.8 percent).<ref name=\":103\"/> Total waste provided 20 percent of district heating generation and between 4 and 5 percent of electricity generation in the country.<ref name=\":9\" /> Energy production from waste over the next ten years is expected to remain at similar levels, new pre treatments of waste may however be developed.\n\n'''Biogas.'''\n\nBiogas generation has been rising steadily from a low base and reached 447 GWh of electricity production in 2014 contributing about 1.5% of Denmarks electricity. Approximately 75% of biogas generating plants are 3 MW or smaller in size which numbered approximately 120 plants in 2015.<ref name=\":103\"/> A further 15 larger CHP plants account for the remaining approximately 25% of biogas consumption and co-fire biogas, mostly with natural gas. The largest source of [[Biogas]] is from manure, other sources include water treatment plants and landfill sites. Many of the smaller plants are located on farms and or other sources of biogas. Smaller biogas plants tend not to contribute heat to district heating networks. Denmark intends to increase production and use of biogas from {{convert|4|PJ|TWh}} consumption in 2015 to {{convert|17|PJ|TWh}} by 2020 with the goal of using 50% of manure in the country.<ref name=\":103\"/> Most of the new biogas is likely to be injected directly into the gas system and used for industry and transport.\n\n'''Biomass.'''\n\n[[Biomass]] provides the largest share of renewable energy in Denmark when considering the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined. The fuel contributed to approximately 8.6% of total electricity generation in Denmark generating 2.6 TWh of electricity in 2014.<ref name=\":103\"/> Total consumption of biomass amounted to {{convert|107|PJ|TWh}} in 2013.<ref name=\":103\"/> There were 39 CHP plants using biomass as a fuel in 2014 consuming approximately 2.7 million tonnes to produce heat and power, corresponding to {{convert|40.9|PJ|TWh}} consumption in that year.<ref name=\":103\"/> Biomass is sometimes co-fired with other fuels including a small percentage that is co-fired with waste.

Between 2009 and 2014 production of power increased by around 50%. By 2024 biomass is expected to double the percentage of renewable energy share from 15% to 30% of renewable electricity production in Denmark.<ref name=\":103\"/> Total consumption of Biomass is expected to rise to {{convert|115|PJ|TWh}} by 2024. A number of power stations are being converted from using coal to using wood pellets as a fuel.

By 2014 this had risen to 597 GWh.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The large increase in solar deployment in 2012 was aided by incentives including tax credits and net settlement for produced power. In response to a dramatic rise in solar installations during that year the incentives were revised downwards for 2013 and a smaller rise occurred during that year. Smaller solar installations predominate with 73% of PV cell capacity being less than 6&nbsp;kW by the end of 2014,<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/VE-produktion/Sider/Sol.aspx|title=Energinet.dk / Climate and Environment / Solar Power|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> a sign that incentives have largely benefitted households.

In one version it is named after Elizabeth Reeby, wife of Michael Reeby who sold the first building lots here in about 1795. Another version has it named after the wife of Captain Barnabas Hughes who purchased The Black Bear Tavern in 1750.\n\nThe officially accepted history is that, in 1753, Captain Barnabas Hughes acquired land and laid out a town, naming it for his wife, Elizabeth.  The early settlers were primarily [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch]].\n\nElizabethtown became a borough in 1827, and a railroad was built through the area in the 1830s. The town was primarily agricultural until the early 1900s, when the Klein Chocolate Company (now part of [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars, Inc.]]) and several shoe factories (the last of which closed in 1979) opened. [[Elizabethtown College]] was established in 1899, and the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Homes (now the Masonic Village) followed in 1910.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Elizabethtown grew rapidly, more than doubling its population between 1950 and 2000. Homes and businesses expanded into nearby farmland, making [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]], farmland preservation, and revitalizing the downtown area important issues.<ref>MacMaster, Richard.

Small factories existed at the turn of the 20th century when the population in 1900 was 1,861. There was a slight increase in the next decade, with 1,970 people living in Elizabethtown in 1910.

In one version it is named after Elizabeth Reeby, wife of Michael Reeby who sold the first building lots here in about 1795. Another version has it named after the wife of Captain Barnabas Hughes who purchased The Black Bear Tavern in 1750.\n\nThe officially accepted history is that, in 1753, Captain Barnabas Hughes acquired land and laid out a town, naming it for his wife, Elizabeth.  The early settlers were primarily [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch]].\n\nElizabethtown became a borough in 1827, and a railroad was built through the area in the 1830s. The town was primarily agricultural until the early 1900s, when the Klein Chocolate Company (now part of [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars, Inc.]]) and several shoe factories (the last of which closed in 1979) opened. [[Elizabethtown College]] was established in 1899, and the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Homes (now the Masonic Village) followed in 1910.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Elizabethtown grew rapidly, more than doubling its population between 1950 and 2000. Homes and businesses expanded into nearby farmland, making [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]], farmland preservation, and revitalizing the downtown area important issues.<ref>MacMaster, Richard.

It was split again in 1853 to create the present [[Clay Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Clay Township]] to the east.\n\nIn early colonial days the area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the County. The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area's first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines. Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export.  Iron production grew, reaching its peak about 1780 and continuing until 1856. The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.\n\nThe [[Brunnerville Road Bridge over Hammer Creek|Hammer Creek Bridge]], [[Stiegel-Coleman House]], and [[Speedwell Forge]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Wolf Sanctuary PA.jpg|300px|thumb| Wolf Sanctuary of PA]]\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 3,833 people, 1,303 households, and 1,088 families living in the township.

Some other smaller villages include [[Elm, Pennsylvania|Elm]], Poplar Grove and Lexington.\n\n==History==\nElizabeth Township was established in 1757 as a split off [[Warwick Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Warwick Township]]. It was split again in 1853 to create the present [[Clay Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Clay Township]] to the east.\n\nIn early colonial days the area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the County. The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area's first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines. Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export.  Iron production grew, reaching its peak about 1780 and continuing until 1856. The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.\n\nThe [[Brunnerville Road Bridge over Hammer Creek|Hammer Creek Bridge]], [[Stiegel-Coleman House]], and [[Speedwell Forge]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Wolf Sanctuary PA.jpg|300px|thumb| Wolf Sanctuary of PA]]\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 3,833 people, 1,303 households, and 1,088 families living in the township.

During the meeting, however, Morley brought the delegates' attention to a [[Cambridge rules#Cambridge Rules of 1863|recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University]] which banned carrying and hacking.

Other clubs forbade both practices.  During the meetings to draw up the FA laws, there was an acrimonious division between the \"hacking\" and \"non-hacking\" clubs.<ref name=\"dec_1\">{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Supplement to Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-05 |page=1 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London),_1863-12-05.png}}</ref>  An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the \"hacking\" clubs predominating.<ref name=\"harvey\">Harvey (2005), pp. 135\u2013139</ref> A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalise (\"settle\") the laws, based on the draft created by Morley in his role as secretary.<ref name=\"nov_24\">{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1863-11-28 |page=6 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bells_Life_in_London)_1863-11-28.png}}</ref> \n\nAt this crucial 24 November meeting, the \"hackers\" were again in a narrow majority.  During the meeting, however, Morley brought the delegates' attention to a [[Cambridge_rules#Cambridge_Rules_of_1863|recently-published set of football laws from Cambridge University]] which banned carrying and hacking.  Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1863-11-28 |page=6 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bells_Life_in_London)_1863-11-28.png |quote=The {{sc|President}} pointed out that the vote just passed to all intents and purposes annulled the business of the evening, whereupon Mr. {{sc|Alcock}} said it was too late to proceed further, and moved that the meeting do adjourn till Tuesday next, Dec. 1, and it was so resolved.}}</ref><ref name=\"dec_1\"/>  A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting,<ref>Harvey (2005), pp. 144-145</ref> resulting in hacking and carrying being banned in the laws that were published later that month.<ref name=\"dec_1\">{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Supplement to Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-05 |page=1 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London),_1863-12-05.png}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent activity with the FA ===\nMorley played in the first ever match under FA rules, for [[1863\u201364 Barnes F.C. season|Barnes against Richmond in December 1863]].

At that year's annual meeting, Morley resigned as FA secretary, citing the demands of business.

He remained captain of Barnes FC, continued to serve on the FA's committee, and played for the \"London\" (FA) team in the [[London v Sheffield (1866)|London v Sheffield]] match held on 31 March 1866, scoring a goal.\n\nBy the time of the next FA annual meeting, in February 1867, the Association's future looked bleak.
