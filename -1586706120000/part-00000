Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] \u2013 a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of the [[Orientalism|Orient]].\n\nIn the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.<ref name=\"National Park brochure\">{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra\n|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park & Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}</ref> Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe phrase \"Shangri-La\" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|\u0f5e\u0f44\u0f0b}}'',\"Shang\" \u2013 a district of [[\u00dc-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]<ref>Chandra Das \u2013 Tibetan English Dictionary</ref>\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f62\u0f72}}'', pronounced \"ri\", \"Mountain\" = \"Shang Mountain\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f63}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, \"Shang Mountain Pass\".\n\nSome scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.<ref name=\"LePage_1977\">{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url=}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nAcademic scholars believe they have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.<ref>Bishop, Peter (1989).

However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column in which he reveals that his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La, if it is any place, is more than 250&nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.<ref name=\"McRae\"/><ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBetween 2002\u20132004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].<ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/>\n\nOn 2&nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, \"Life in Shangri-La\", in which Yan said that \"Shangri-La\" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops and local farmers as they harvested crops, and sampled their cuisine.\n\nTelevision presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the \"Shangri-La\" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.\n\nThe Travel Channel in 2016 aired two episodes of ''Expedition Unknown'' that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas, including the sky caves found there, in search of Shangri-La. His findings offer no proof that Shangri-La is or was real.\n\n==Usage==\nShangri-La is often used in a context similar to \"[[Garden of Eden]],\" to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive but much sought; for a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's \"Shangri-La.\" It also might be used to represent a sought-for perfection in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nThere are a number of cultural usages of the Shangri-La idea that have developed since 1933 in the wake of the novel and the film made from it.\n\n=== World War II ===\nAn unusual consequence of the [[Doolittle Raid]] of 1942 came after, when (in the interests of secrecy) President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] answered a reporter's question by saying that the raid had been launched from \"Shangri-La\".<ref> See [[Camp David]]</ref> The true details of the raid were revealed to the public one year later, in April 1943.<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1943/04/20/One-year-later-Tokyo-raid-story-told/8761134802538/ \"One year later, Tokyo raid story told\"].

This weapon, however, ended in failure due to a variety of issues resulting in a switch back to the weapons it intended to replace. The beginning of the [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts 1979\u20131990|Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts]] however, showed the PLA that their SKS and Type 56s were not as effective as they thought, causing their small arms development program to spring back to life.\n\nThe weapon was introduced into PLA service in 1981 but did not become widely distributed until the late 1980s. It replaced the SKS,<ref>[https://warisboring.com/the-sks-is-the-cockroach-of-war-weapons-37a339b67fc0#.dlm7bp5sc The SKS Is the Cockroach of Weapons-You just can\u2019t kill Sergei Simonov\u2019s old, reliable, semi-automatic carbine]</ref> the Type 56 assault rifle and even the [[RPD machine gun]] (LMG version), succeeding where the Type 63 failed. Its first combat use came during the latter part of the Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts of the mid-1980s. The PLA has replaced most of its Type-81s with the [[QBZ-95|Type 95]] or [[QBZ-03|Type 03]] series of weapons, though it is still in service in the reserves and armed police. An improved version is also used by the [[Bangladesh Army]] under the designation BD-08.\n\n==Design==\nThe Type 81 incorporates elements of the [[Dragunov sniper rifle|Dragunov]], [[SKS]], and [[AK-47]] series rifles. The design criteria it met included accuracy of 1.78 inch R<sub>50</sub>, that is 50% of the hits within a 1.78 inch diameter at 100 meters; improved controllability in full-automatic; the same reliability of the AK but a longer service life to approximately 20,000 rounds; and able to use existing AK and SKS production tooling at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.redstararms.com/type81.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122090500/http://www.redstararms.com/type81.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe rifle retains the general layout of the Chinese [[Type 56 assault rifle]], but it has a SKS-like short-stroke gas-piston design and other improvements to reduce recoil and muzzle jump, giving better firing accuracy. Notable physical differences from the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] include the stock of the rifle, the length of the action, bayonet, and the positioning of the front sight.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\" />\n\nThe most easily distinguishable feature of the Type 81 is the more exposed muzzle part of the barrel. The front sight has been moved back as a modification to be able to fire [[22 mm grenade|22mm rifle grenades]], which are slid over the unobstructed barrel muzzle now formed into a [[spigot]]-type [[rifle grenade]] launcher.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\" />\n\nThere is a significant gap between the trigger guard and the magazine on Type 81 rifles, while on the Type 56 rifle series the magazine is adjacent to the front of the trigger guard.\n\nThe non-detachable swing-out spike-shaped bayonet of the Type 56 rifle was also replaced on Type 81 rifles with the detachable Type 81 knife-bayonet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/China/China_2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803163542/http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/China/China_2.html |archive-date=3 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessors, the Type 81 is a series of weapons.

({{zh|c=81\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa; literally; \"Type 81 Automatic Rifle\"}}) is a Chinese-designed second-generation, [[selective-fire]], [[gas-operated]] [[7.62\u00d739mm]] assault rifle (based on [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov]] and [[SKS]] [[Action (firearms)|actions]]) adopted by the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) and has been in service since the mid-1980s.\n\n==History==\nThe [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]'s first attempt to replace their aging [[SKS]] and [[Type 56 assault rifle]] (a Chinese license produced [[AK-47]]) was the [[Type 63 assault rifle]]. This weapon, however, ended in failure due to a variety of issues resulting in a switch back to the weapons it intended to replace. The beginning of the [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts 1979\u20131990|Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts]] however, showed the PLA that their SKS and Type 56s were not as effective as they thought, causing their small arms development program to spring back to life.\n\nThe weapon was introduced into PLA service in 1981 but did not become widely distributed until the late 1980s. It replaced the SKS,<ref>[https://warisboring.com/the-sks-is-the-cockroach-of-war-weapons-37a339b67fc0#.dlm7bp5sc The SKS Is the Cockroach of Weapons-You just can\u2019t kill Sergei Simonov\u2019s old, reliable, semi-automatic carbine]</ref> the Type 56 assault rifle and even the [[RPD machine gun]] (LMG version), succeeding where the Type 63 failed. Its first combat use came during the latter part of the Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts of the mid-1980s. The PLA has replaced most of its Type-81s with the [[QBZ-95|Type 95]] or [[QBZ-03|Type 03]] series of weapons, though it is still in service in the reserves and armed police. An improved version is also used by the [[Bangladesh Army]] under the designation BD-08.\n\n==Design==\nThe Type 81 incorporates elements of the [[Dragunov sniper rifle|Dragunov]], [[SKS]], and [[AK-47]] series rifles. The design criteria it met included accuracy of 1.78 inch R<sub>50</sub>, that is 50% of the hits within a 1.78 inch diameter at 100 meters; improved controllability in full-automatic; the same reliability of the AK but a longer service life to approximately 20,000 rounds; and able to use existing AK and SKS production tooling at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.redstararms.com/type81.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122090500/http://www.redstararms.com/type81.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe rifle retains the general layout of the Chinese [[Type 56 assault rifle]], but it has a SKS-like short-stroke gas-piston design and other improvements to reduce recoil and muzzle jump, giving better firing accuracy. Notable physical differences from the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] include the stock of the rifle, the length of the action, bayonet, and the positioning of the front sight.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\" />\n\nThe most easily distinguishable feature of the Type 81 is the more exposed muzzle part of the barrel. The front sight has been moved back as a modification to be able to fire [[22 mm grenade|22mm rifle grenades]], which are slid over the unobstructed barrel muzzle now formed into a [[spigot]]-type [[rifle grenade]] launcher.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\" />\n\nThere is a significant gap between the trigger guard and the magazine on Type 81 rifles, while on the Type 56 rifle series the magazine is adjacent to the front of the trigger guard.\n\nThe non-detachable swing-out spike-shaped bayonet of the Type 56 rifle was also replaced on Type 81 rifles with the detachable Type 81 knife-bayonet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/China/China_2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803163542/http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/China/China_2.html |archive-date=3 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessors, the Type 81 is a series of weapons.

He is often taunted by his more successful work colleagues, and his ideas are dismissed by egotistical entrepreneur Erlich Bachman, who owns the technology development [[Business incubator|incubator]] where Richard lives with fellow programmers Nelson \"Big Head\" Bighetti, Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai. However when Hooli stumbles upon the music copyright service that Richard is working on, entitled Pied Piper, they discover that hidden within the useless application is the best [[Data compression|file compression algorithm]] in the world, and news spreads quickly. Eventually Richard is caught between a $10 million [[buyout]] by Hooli [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory, and must decide whether to give up his program to the highest bidder or to take the investment and create a business out of it himself.

Luckily, Belson's former [[Personal assistant|PA]], Jared Dunn, arrives at the incubator, begging Richard to hire him, as he sees huge potential in the Pied Piper idea, and is hired due to his business expertise. However, in evaluating the Pied Piper team, Jared discovers that while Gilfoyle and Dinesh are brilliant coders, Big Head is comparatively mediocre, and Richard is pressured by everyone to fire him as he brings nothing to the table. After much arguing, Richard refuses to do so, but Big Head announces that he was given a huge raise and promotion at Hooli, as Gavin Belson wants to publicize Big Head as co-founder of Pied Piper. Later, Big Head tells Richard that work has begun on [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] Pied Piper to create the same product, branded under a different name.\n |LineColor=000000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Silicon Valley (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Articles of Incorporation\n |DirectedBy=[[Tricia Brock (director)|Tricia Brock]]\n |WrittenBy=Matteo Borghese & Rob Turbovsky\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|20}}\n |Viewers=1.62<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/22/sunday-cable-ratings-game-of-thrones-wins-night-nba-playoffs-real-housewives-of-atlanta-naked-and-afraid-more/256183/|title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Game of Thrones' Wins Night, + NBA Playoffs, 'Real Housewives of Atlanta', 'Naked and Afraid' & More|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=Richard and Jared discover that the Pied Piper business name is already in use by an irrigation enterprise in [[Gilroy, California]]. While Jared, Dinesh and Gilfoyle begin brainstorming new names for the application, Erlich decides to find a name by setting off on a [[vision quest]] at [[Sonora Desert]], which results in Erlich having a panic attack after consuming [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]]. Adamant on keeping the original name, Richard attempts to prove that he is a good negotiator by convincing the irrigation company to give up the name Pied Piper. Initially the company's owner asks for a small amount of money but after reading about the technology's success on the web, he asks for a lot more. After confronting him, Richard manages to keep the name for almost the original price, while Erlich, still in the aftermath of his vision quest, returns with a child by his side, convinced he has found another version of himself. Meanwhile, Peter Gregory becomes obsessed with [[Burger King]] products, leaving his assistant Monica in a difficult position with some of their clients, who need an urgent cash injection or risk firing hundreds of people.

Meanwhile, Big Head is removed from Hooli's [[Copycat (software)|copycat compression software]] project, named Nucleus, because of his complete lack of understanding of what Richard actually did to create Pied Piper, and is not reassigned to anything, joining the other unassigned employees that spend their days doing nothing on the company's roof.

It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain.

It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were separated from the sources of tin and copper necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sharples |first=Niall M |title=English Heritage Book of Maiden Castle |publisher=B.

In addition to the hill forts, several sites have been identified as settlements during the pre Roman period including [[Cambria Farm]] and the \"Lake Villages\" at [[Meare Lake Village|Meare]] and [[Glastonbury Lake Village|Glastonbury]] which were built on a [[Marsh|morass]], on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, [[bracken]], rubble and clay. Most of the sites fell out of use with the coming of the Romans and therefore this list covers those sites occupied until that time.\n\nAlmost all of the sites in the list are [[Scheduled Monument]]s. In the United Kingdom, a Scheduled Monument is a \"nationally important\" [[archaeological site]] or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. Scheduled Monuments are specified in the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]], which defines a monument as:\n\n:''Any building, structure or work above or below the surface of the land, any cave or excavation; any site comprising the remains of any such building, structure or work or any cave or excavation; and any site comprising or comprising the remains of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft or other movable structure or part thereof...'' (Section 61 (7)).<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1979/46/section/61|title=Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979}}</ref>\n\nDamage to a scheduled monument is a [[criminal offence]] and any work taking place at one of these sites requires Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State. In England, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] keeps the register, or schedule, of nationally important sites which receive state protection, which now includes over 31,000 sites.<ref>{{cite web|title=What can be scheduled? |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/scheduled-monuments/what-can-be-scheduled/ |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=26 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130062845/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/scheduled-monuments/what-can-be-scheduled/ |archivedate=30 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Known hill forts and settlements ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|+List of hill forts and ancient settlements in Somerset\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:160px;\"|Site name<br />Alternative name(s)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|Age\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\" class=\"unsortable\"|[[National Heritage List for England]] number\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:90px;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Plan or photo\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:130px;\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Athelney|Athelney hill fort]]\n|{{sort|40|[[Iron Age]]}}\n|1019099<ref>{{cite web |title=Anglo-Saxon occupation site and site of Athelney Abbey on Athelney Hill |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1019099 |work=[[National Heritage List for England]] |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=1 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502040412/https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1019099# |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|align=center |[[File:Kingalfredsmonument.jpg|90px]]\n|[[Athelney]]<br /><small>{{coord|51.0557|N|2.9331|W|type:landmark_region:GB|name=Athelney}}</small>||style=\"text-align:left\"|\nAthelney Hill fort is an Iron Age hill fort.
