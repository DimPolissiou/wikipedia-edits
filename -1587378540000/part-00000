UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary John Batchelor (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds.

Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary John Batchelor (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAs a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as paintings, woodblock prints (such as the ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''), poetry, music, theater, film, [[manga]], [[anime]], [[pottery]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp/masterpieces/index.html|title=\u53ce\u8535\u54c1\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb &#124; \u30b5\u30f3\u30ea\u30c4\u670d\u90e8\u7f8e\u8853\u9928|website=www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp}}</ref> and even [[Kawaii]] subculture.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:New and Old Rokuman-T\u014d of Taiseki-ji.jpg|Mount Fuji in the background of [[Taisekiji]] temple\nFile:Lake Motosu04.jpg|Mt.

A descendant of the illustrious noble [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]], whose influence in shaping [[History of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman history]] between 1656 and 1711 surpassed even that of the [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]], Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was a key figure in the intersection of scholarship and politics in early 20th century Turkey.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Childhood and Education ===\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was born in the city of [[Istanbul|Istanbul]] in 1890 as K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Mehmed Fuad.  His paternal grandfather, Ahmet Ziya Bey, was the former ambassador to Bucharest, and Ahmet Ziya Bey was son of the former head of the Imperial Chancery of State (Divan-i Humayun Beylikcisi), K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Arif Bey. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Arif Bey descended from the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fcs of the 17th century, an exceptional dynasty of [[Grand vizier|Grand Viziers]] whose reforms and conquests delayed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was named after the first Grand Vizier of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Era, [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]].\n\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc received his formal education at ''[[Hagia Sophia|Ayasofya]] Rusdiyesi'' and ''Mercan Idadisi'', both formed by Ottoman authorities to modernize and reform the [[Ottoman education system]]. In 1905, while a student at ''Mercan Idadisi'' and only 15 years old, the magazine ''Musavver Terakki'' published three poems by Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc. By the time he entered the [[Istanbul University School of Law]] at the age of 17, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc already had an excellent command of [[French language|French]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. His first book, ''Hayat-i Fikriyye'' (The Intellectual Life), was published when he was 19 years old. After three years of study, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc abandoned the School of Law because of the poor quality of instruction, saying that diploma was not worth the loss of time it would entail.\n\n=== The Making of a Nationalist Intellectual ===\n[[File:Mehmet fuat koprulu.jpg|thumb|185px|An image of Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc in his early days]]\nFrom 1910 to 1913, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc taught Ottoman language and literature at various high schools in Istanbul, including the prestigious [[Galatasaray High School]]. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc initially opposed the literary movement known as New Language, which sought to simplify the Turkish language, and wrote articles for the ''Servet-i Funun'' magazine using a literary style comprehensible only to the most learned of Ottoman intellectuals. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc changed his writing style and politics during the [[Balkan Wars]]. On February 6, 1913, the day after the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] army attacked the Ottoman lines in the outskirts of Istanbul, ''Turk Yurdu'' magazine, a bastion of simplified Turkish prose and [[Turkish nationalism]], published the first of many popular and patriotic essays by the 23-year-old Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc: \u201c''Umit ve Azim''\u201d (Hope and Determination), \u201c''Hicret Matemleri''\u201d (Mourning Migration), \u201c''Turk\u2019un Duasi''\u201d (A Turk's Prayer), and \u201cT''urkluk, Islamlik, Osmanlilik''\u201d (Turkishness, Islamness, Ottomanness).\n\nToward the end of 1913, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc published his seminal and widely lauded academic article, \u201cT''urk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul''\u201d (The Method in Turkish Literary History), in ''Bilgi Mecmuasi''. He argued that historians should not only research kings, [[vizier]]s, commanders and scholars, but ordinary people as well. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc believed that in addition to public and official records, historians should also study art, archeology, literature, language, folklore and oral traditions. His plea for historians to study social history was so unique and ahead of its time that the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France, famous for embracing a similar approach in the journal ''Annales d\u2019histoire economique et sociale'', did not emerge until 1929, a full 16 years after the publication of \"''Turk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul''\". One month after the publication of the article, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Professor of the History of Turkish Literature at [[Istanbul University]]. He was only 23 years old.\n\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc continued his scholarly research and academic publications through the years, eventually culminating in his magnum opus, ''Turk Edebiyatinda Ilk Mutasavviflar'' (First Mystics in Turkish Literature), in 1918, a book that focused on two Turkish [[Sufism|mystics]] and folk poets, [[Ahmad Yasawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] and [[Yunus Emre]]. His ''Turk Edebiyati Tarihi'' (History of Turkish Literature), published in 1920, was another seminal book that traced the history of [[Turkish literature]] through millennia. In 1923, at the age of 33, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Literature at Istanbul University. In a short book entitled ''Turkiye Tarihi'' (The History of Turkey) published that same year, he reviewed the [[History of the Turkic peoples|history of the Turks]] from ancient Central Asia to the modern Ottoman Empire, continuing the approach he pioneered in his study of Turkish literature.\n\n=== Relationship with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ===\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Undersecretary to the Minister of Education at the request of President Atat\u00fcrk and remained in this post for eight months.  In addition, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed the Director of the Turcology Institute, established on the orders of President Atat\u00fcrk, and began publishing ''Turkiyat Mecmuasi'' (The Turcology Journal).\n\n=== International Recognition ===\n[[File:Fuat Koprulu MSB.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Another image of Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc in the 1930s]]\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc won numerous international accolades for his scholarship as well.  The Soviet Academy of Sciences granted him a corresponding membership in 1925.  The [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]] honored him with an honorary degree in 1927.  The [[University of Athens]] and the [[Sorbonne University|University of Paris]] (Sorbonne) granted him honorary doctorates in 1937 and 1939, respectively.  In fact, most European Oriental societies made him a corresponding or honorary member, as did the American Oriental Society in 1947.\n\nIn 1933, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc became a professor ordinarius, a title denoting a professor of the highest rank in Turkey.  In 1935, he delivered a series of influential lectures at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) on the origins of the Ottoman Empire.  Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc argued that ethnic Turks formed the Ottoman Empire using Seljuk and Ilhanid administrative traditions, and he discredited the prevailing view among Western scholars that the Ottoman Empire was formed by a race of predominantly Albanians, Eastern Romans and also Slavic converts to Islam.\n\nEven though the Ottoman Empire's founder might have been of Oghuz origins, the success of the expansion and continuity of the Ottoman Empire was due to its meritochratic and multi ethnic system composed of the converts to Islam. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was the prime example to that as a descendant of the illustrious noble [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]], whose influence in shaping [[History of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman history]] between 1656 and 1711 surpassed even that of the [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]],\n\n=== Later Political Life ===\nIn 1935, at the request of President Atat\u00fcrk, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc joined the single party regime in the Turkish Parliament as a Kars deputy, and was elected again in 1939 and 1943.  In 1945, as calls to establish a multiparty democracy increased after World War II, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc joined the opposition and was dismissed from the ruling party along with [[Adnan Menderes]] and [[Refik Koraltan]].  In 1946, Menderes, Koraltan and K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, together with [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar|Celal Bayar]], formed the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946\u201361)|Democratic Party]].  Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when the Democratic Party came to power in the 1950 elections, and he served in this post until 1955.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Foreign Policy as Nation Making: Turkey and Egypt in the Cold War|last=Abou-El-Fadl|first=Reem|date=2018-12-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781108475044|location=|pages=126\u2013127|language=en}}</ref> In 1953, an agreement was reached between Yugoslav [[President Tito]] and Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc that promoted the emigration of Albanians from Yugoslavia to Anatolia.<ref name=\"Qirezi50\">{{cite book|last=Qirezi|first=Arben|chapter=Settling the self-determination dispute in Kosovo|editor1-last=Mehmeti|editor1-first=Leandrit I.|editor2-last=Radelji\u0107|editor2-first=Branislav|title=Kosovo and Serbia: Contested Options and Shared Consequences|year=2017|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822981572|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=IWMqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&dq=Serbian+colonization+Kosovo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh7JmB1PXiAhWNT30KHe6yBxIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Mehmet%20&f=false|pages=50|ref=harv}}</ref> Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc also briefly served as Deputy Prime Minister in 1955.

Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was named after the first Grand Vizier of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Era, [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]].\n\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc received his formal education at ''[[Hagia Sophia|Ayasofya]] Rusdiyesi'' and ''Mercan Idadisi'', both formed by Ottoman authorities to modernize and reform the [[Ottoman education system]]. In 1905, while a student at ''Mercan Idadisi'' and only 15 years old, the magazine ''Musavver Terakki'' published three poems by Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc. By the time he entered the [[Istanbul University School of Law]] at the age of 17, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc already had an excellent command of [[French language|French]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. His first book, ''Hayat-i Fikriyye'' (The Intellectual Life), was published when he was 19 years old. After three years of study, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc abandoned the School of Law because of the poor quality of instruction, saying that diploma was not worth the loss of time it would entail.\n\n=== The Making of a Nationalist Intellectual ===\n[[File:Mehmet fuat koprulu.jpg|thumb|185px|An image of Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc in his early days]]\nFrom 1910 to 1913, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc taught Ottoman language and literature at various high schools in Istanbul, including the prestigious [[Galatasaray High School]]. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc initially opposed the literary movement known as New Language, which sought to simplify the Turkish language, and wrote articles for the ''Servet-i Funun'' magazine using a literary style comprehensible only to the most learned of Ottoman intellectuals. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc changed his writing style and politics during the [[Balkan Wars]]. On February 6, 1913, the day after the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] army attacked the Ottoman lines in the outskirts of Istanbul, ''Turk Yurdu'' magazine, a bastion of simplified Turkish prose and [[Turkish nationalism]], published the first of many popular and patriotic essays by the 23-year-old Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc: \u201c''Umit ve Azim''\u201d (Hope and Determination), \u201c''Hicret Matemleri''\u201d (Mourning Migration), \u201c''Turk\u2019un Duasi''\u201d (A Turk's Prayer), and \u201cT''urkluk, Islamlik, Osmanlilik''\u201d (Turkishness, Islamness, Ottomanness).\n\nToward the end of 1913, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc published his seminal and widely lauded academic article, \u201cT''urk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul''\u201d (The Method in Turkish Literary History), in ''Bilgi Mecmuasi''. He argued that historians should not only research kings, [[vizier]]s, commanders and scholars, but ordinary people as well. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc believed that in addition to public and official records, historians should also study art, archeology, literature, language, folklore and oral traditions. His plea for historians to study social history was so unique and ahead of its time that the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France, famous for embracing a similar approach in the journal ''Annales d\u2019histoire economique et sociale'', did not emerge until 1929, a full 16 years after the publication of \"''Turk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul''\". One month after the publication of the article, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Professor of the History of Turkish Literature at [[Istanbul University]]. He was only 23 years old.\n\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc continued his scholarly research and academic publications through the years, eventually culminating in his magnum opus, ''Turk Edebiyatinda Ilk Mutasavviflar'' (First Mystics in Turkish Literature), in 1918, a book that focused on two Turkish [[Sufism|mystics]] and folk poets, [[Ahmad Yasawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] and [[Yunus Emre]]. His ''Turk Edebiyati Tarihi'' (History of Turkish Literature), published in 1920, was another seminal book that traced the history of [[Turkish literature]] through millennia. In 1923, at the age of 33, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Literature at Istanbul University. In a short book entitled ''Turkiye Tarihi'' (The History of Turkey) published that same year, he reviewed the [[History of the Turkic peoples|history of the Turks]] from ancient Central Asia to the modern Ottoman Empire, continuing the approach he pioneered in his study of Turkish literature.\n\n=== Relationship with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ===\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed Undersecretary to the Minister of Education at the request of President Atat\u00fcrk and remained in this post for eight months.  In addition, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was appointed the Director of the Turcology Institute, established on the orders of President Atat\u00fcrk, and began publishing ''Turkiyat Mecmuasi'' (The Turcology Journal).\n\n=== International Recognition ===\n[[File:Fuat Koprulu MSB.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Another image of Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc in the 1930s]]\nFuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc won numerous international accolades for his scholarship as well.  The Soviet Academy of Sciences granted him a corresponding membership in 1925.  The [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]] honored him with an honorary degree in 1927.  The [[University of Athens]] and the [[Sorbonne University|University of Paris]] (Sorbonne) granted him honorary doctorates in 1937 and 1939, respectively.  In fact, most European Oriental societies made him a corresponding or honorary member, as did the American Oriental Society in 1947.\n\nIn 1933, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc became a professor ordinarius, a title denoting a professor of the highest rank in Turkey.  In 1935, he delivered a series of influential lectures at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) on the origins of the Ottoman Empire.  Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc argued that ethnic Turks formed the Ottoman Empire using Seljuk and Ilhanid administrative traditions, and he discredited the prevailing view among Western scholars that the Ottoman Empire was formed by a race of predominantly Albanians, Eastern Romans and also Slavic converts to Islam.\n\nEven though the Ottoman Empire's founder might have been of Oghuz origins, the success of the expansion and continuity of the Ottoman Empire was due to its meritochratic and multi ethnic system composed of the converts to Islam. Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was the prime example to that as a descendant of the illustrious noble [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]], whose influence in shaping [[History of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman history]] between 1656 and 1711 surpassed even that of the [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]],\n\n=== Later Political Life ===\nIn 1935, at the request of President Atat\u00fcrk, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc joined the single party regime in the Turkish Parliament as a Kars deputy, and was elected again in 1939 and 1943.  In 1945, as calls to establish a multiparty democracy increased after World War II, Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc joined the opposition and was dismissed from the ruling party along with [[Adnan Menderes]] and [[Refik Koraltan]].  In 1946, Menderes, Koraltan and K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, together with [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar|Celal Bayar]], formed the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946\u201361)|Democratic Party]].  Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when the Democratic Party came to power in the 1950 elections, and he served in this post until 1955.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Foreign Policy as Nation Making: Turkey and Egypt in the Cold War|last=Abou-El-Fadl|first=Reem|date=2018-12-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781108475044|location=|pages=126\u2013127|language=en}}</ref> In 1953, an agreement was reached between Yugoslav [[President Tito]] and Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc that promoted the emigration of Albanians from Yugoslavia to Anatolia.<ref name=\"Qirezi50\">{{cite book|last=Qirezi|first=Arben|chapter=Settling the self-determination dispute in Kosovo|editor1-last=Mehmeti|editor1-first=Leandrit I.|editor2-last=Radelji\u0107|editor2-first=Branislav|title=Kosovo and Serbia: Contested Options and Shared Consequences|year=2017|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822981572|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=IWMqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&dq=Serbian+colonization+Kosovo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh7JmB1PXiAhWNT30KHe6yBxIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Mehmet%20&f=false|pages=50|ref=harv}}</ref> Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc also briefly served as Deputy Prime Minister in 1955.

Arrays of a [[photovoltaic system]] supply [[solar electricity]] to electrical equipment.\n\nThe most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160\u201370 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}</ref>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\". Micro-inverters work independently to enable each panel to contribute its maximum possible output for a given amount of sunlight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Micro Inverters for Residential Solar Arrays |url=https://www.expertsure.com/uk/home/micro-inverters-for-residential-solar-arrays/ |accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n{{Main article|Crystalline silicon|Thin film solar cell}}\n[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Market-share of PV technologies since 1990]]\n\nMost solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) [[solar cells]] made of [[polycrystalline silicon|multicrystalline]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\".

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.
