The tuning of the optical nonlinearities have been demonstrated during its entire laser-induced reduction process through continuous increase of the laser irradiance and four stages of different nonlinear activities have been discovered, which may serve as promising solid state materials for novel nonlinear functional devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = In Situ Third-Order Non-linear Responses During Laser Reduction of Graphene Oxide Thin Films Towards On-Chip Non-linear Photonic Devices|date = May 7, 2014|journal = Xiaorui Zheng|doi=10.1002/adma.201304681|pmid = 24639376|volume=26|issue = 17|pages=2699\u20132703|last1 = Zheng|first1 = Xiaorui|last2 = Jia|first2 = Baohua|last3 = Chen|first3 = Xi|last4 = Gu|first4 = Min|hdl = 1959.3/375725|hdl-access = free}}</ref> It is also proved that metal nanoparticles can greatly enhance the optical nonlinearity<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fakhri|first1=P|title=Nonlocal nonlinear optical response of graphene oxide- Au nanoparticles dispersed in different solvents|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=18|issue=1|page=015502|doi=10.1088/2040-8978/18/1/015502|bibcode=2016JOpt...18a5502F|year=2016}}</ref> and [[fluorescence]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Omidvar|first1=A|title=Metal-enhanced fluorescence of graphene oxide by palladium nanoparticles in the blue-green part of the spectrum|journal=Chinese Physics B|volume=25|issue=11|pages=118102|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/25/11/118102|url=http://cpb.iphy.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract68594.shtml|bibcode=2016ChPhB..25k8102O|year=2016}}</ref> of graphene oxide.\n\n===Graphene manufacture===\nGraphite oxide has attracted much interest as a possible route for the large-scale production and manipulation of [[graphene]], a material with extraordinary electronic properties.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Graphite oxide.svg|thumb|Structure proposed in 1998<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = H. | last2 = Klinowski | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = M. | last4 = Lerf | first4 = A. | title = A new structural model for graphite oxide | doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(98)00144-4 | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 287 | issue = 1 | pages = 53 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1998CPL...287...53H }}</ref> with functional groups.

The graphene was bombarded with [[gallium]] ions, which disrupt carbon bonds. Etching the result with an oxidizing solution produces a hole at each spot struck by a gallium ion. The length of time spent in the oxidizing solution determined average pore size. Pore density reached 5 trillion pores per square centimeter, while retaining structural integrity. The pores permitted [[cations|cation]] transport at short oxidation times, consistent with [[electrostatic repulsion]] from negatively charged [[functional group]]s at pore edges. At longer oxidation times, sheets were permeable to salt but not larger organic molecules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/selective-nanopores-in-graphene-dramatically-improve-desalination-and-purification |title=Selective nanopores in graphene dramatically improve desalination and purification |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}<br />{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/nl404118f| pmid = 24490698| title = Selective Ionic Transport through Tunable Subnanometer Pores in Single-Layer Graphene Membranes| journal = Nano Letters| volume = 14| issue = 3| pages = 1234\u201341| year = 2014| last1 = o\u2019Hern | first1 = S.

Bacteria were used to produce a material consisting of two [[nanocellulose]] layers. The lower layer contains pristine [[cellulose]], while the top layer contains cellulose and graphene oxide, which absorbs sunlight and produces heat. The system draws water from below into the material. The water diffuses into the higher layer, where it evaporates and leaves behind any contaminants. The evaporate condenses on  top, where it can be captured. The film is produced by repeatedly adding a fluid coating that hardens. Bacteria produce nanocellulose fibers with interspersed graphene oxide flakes. The film is light and easily manufactured at scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/graphene-oxide-water-purification-wustl/44586|title=Graphene-based sheets make dirty water drinkable simply and cheaply|last=Jeffrey|first=Colin|date=July 27, 2016|website=newatlas.com|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Coating ===\nOptically transparent, multilayer films made from ''graphene oxide ''are impermeable under dry conditions.

Graphene oxide-based composites functionalized with metal oxides and sulfides have been shown in recent research to induce enhanced battery performance. This has similarly been adapted into applications in supercapacitors, since the electronic properties of graphene oxide allow it to bypass some of the more prevalent restrictions of typical transition metal oxide electrodes.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_oxide"}

As of the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 77,648,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Largo city, Florida| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> up from 69,371 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]].\n\nLargo was first incorporated in 1905. In 1913, it became the first municipality in Pinellas County to adopt a [[council-manager government]]. It switched back and forth from \"town\" to \"city\" a few times, and became a city again in 1974. It was an exporter of agricultural products until the 1960s population growth began to transform it into a [[commuter town|bedroom community]]. From 1905 to 2010, Largo grew in area from {{convert|9/16|sqmi|km2}} to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}}, and in population from about 300 people to more than 70,000. Largo began as a rural farming community and became the third largest city in Florida's most densely populated county.\n\nLargo is a [[sister city]] to [[Tosayamada, K\u014dchi]], Japan. In 2007, Largo was named a National [[Arbor Day]] Tree City for the 28th year in a row and is the only city in Tampa Bay that is a Sterling Tree City.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings of the area===\n{{Main|Timeline of Largo history}}\nThe native inhabitants of the Largo area were the [[Tocobaga]] Indians. They are also known as the Safety Harbor culture from their archeological remains near present-day [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]]. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] came to Florida in the 16th century.  In the 18th century, the Tocobaga had been virtually destroyed after years of exposure to European diseases, Spanish settlement efforts and warfare between Spain and England. The Largo area, like the rest of Pinellas County, was largely deserted.  In 1763, Spain transferred sovereignty of Florida to The United Kingdom. In 1783, Florida fell to Spanish sovereignty once again until it was transferred to the United States in 1821. By 1845, a surveyor recorded the location of Lake Tolulu, apparently south of present-day East Bay Drive and roughly where the Largo Central Park Nature Preserve is today.\n\n[[Image:Largo Central Park Nature Preserve01.JPG|thumb|right|Boardwalk across wetlands in Largo Central Park Nature Preserve, the bed of former Lake Largo]]\nLater, homesteaders to the Largo area were the families of James and Daniel McMullen around 1852. The McMullens and other settlers raised cattle, grew citrus and vegetables and fished. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Largo area residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. James and Daniel McMullen were members of the [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|\"Cow Cavalry\"]] driving Florida cattle to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]] to help sustain the war effort.  Other area residents served on [[blockade runner]]s.  Still others left the area to serve in the Confederacy's armies. After the war, Largo area residents returned to farming, ranching, and raising citrus. The [[Orange Belt Railway]] reached the area in 1888. By this time Lake Tolulu had been renamed Lake Largo, and residents of the community west of the lake adopted the name \"Largo\".\n\n===Early Largo===\n[[Image:Largo, florida city hall 02small.jpg|thumb|left|Largo City Hall]]\nThe Town of Largo was incorporated in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 to make way for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo's population increased about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo's economy was based on agriculture\u2014[[citrus]] groves, [[cattle ranch]]es, and [[Pig farming|hog farms]], as well as [[turpentine]] stills and [[sawmill]]s. Largo is best remembered as \"Citrus City\", from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and shipping center.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] was unkind to Largo. Largo lacked the financial resources to meet its obligations.  Largo reverted to its 1913 boundaries and [[charter]]. The population dropped approximately 30%. The debt incurred by the issuance of bonds in the late 1920s was not paid off until after [[World War II]].\n\n===Rapid growth ===\n[[Image:Taylor Park, Largo, florida01small.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Lake Park is a county park in Largo on 8th Avenue SW]]\nThe years after [[World War II]] saw rapid growth as people began moving into the area and Largo annexed surrounding lands. During the [[nuclear arms race]], electronics companies like [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]] boosted the economy. The population increased to about 5,000 in 1960, to about 20,000 in 1970, and to about 70,000 in 2005. Largo's original area was 9/16th of a square mile. By 1982, Largo had grown to about {{convert|13|sqmi|km2|0}} and to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}} in 2010. The groves, farms, ranches and forests have mostly given way to homes and shopping centers and light industry. The increased population resulted in a need for increased city services. All departments saw rapid growth and improvements in quality, especially under the leadership of the late Mayor Thom Feaster. In 1995, Largo Central Park opened on the site of the old Pinellas County Fairgrounds. It is the setting for the Largo Central Park Performing Arts Center and the Largo Public Library.\n\nIn the 2006 commission elections, Largo achieved two milestones furthering its former motto of \"City of Progress\". [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patricia Gerard]] became the city's first female mayor. She narrowly defeated incumbent mayor [[Robert E. Jackson]], in a bitterly contested race. (Dr. Jackson had been the longest serving elected Democrat in Pinellas County.) The voters' choice between these two candidates decided the major issue of the election:  that the city would not revert to a mayor-dominated process of governance in lieu of the continuing role for the seven-member commission acting as non-partisans\u2014that is, deliberating independently and equally with the mayor and deciding democratically the political issues of the city.\n\nAlso, the city elected its first commissioner of [[African-American]] descent, Rodney J. Woods, in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] against a former commissioner.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the iconic Largo [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]], which was constructed shortly after completion of Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the change because of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection was not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.<ref name=\"Its time for Largo clock tower to go\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article1000360.ece |title=Removal of Largo Clock Tower |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLargo is located at {{Coord|27|54|30|N|82|46|40|W}} (27.908355, \u221282.777791).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is centrally located in Pinellas County, touching the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the southwest and [[Tampa Bay]] to the northeast. [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] is Largo's neighbor to the north. To the northwest are the towns of [[Belleair, Florida|Belleair]] and [[Belleair Bluffs, Florida|Belleair Bluffs]]. The city of [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] lies south of eastern Largo. [[Seminole, Florida|Seminole]] lies south of western Largo. The unincorporated community of [[Ridgecrest, Florida|Ridgecrest]] forms a large enclave between western and central Largo. A number of county enclaves pepper the City of Largo.\n\n[[File:Largo, FL street flooding during TS Debby, June 2012.jpg|thumb|A Largo street floods after [[Tropical Storm Debby (2012)]]]]\nIn 2010, Largo's total area was {{convert|48.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|45.6|sqkm|order=flip}} was land and {{convert|2.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 5.22%, was water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Largo city, Florida |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> As of 2004, there were {{convert|651|acre|km2|1}} of park lands.

Largo is dotted with a number of lakes, the largest of which is Taylor Lake at {{convert|53|acre|m2}}. Allen's Creek drains northeast Largo, flowing into Tampa Bay. McKay Creek flows through southwest Largo into the Intracoastal Waterway. The McKay Creek basin is prone to flooding.\n\n===Climate===\nLargo is located on the Pinellas Peninsula, so that its climate is moderated by its proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and Tampa Bay. In the winter, temperatures are warmer on the Pinellas Peninsula than on mainland Florida. Winters are generally drier than the rest of the year. Most of the rainfall comes in the summer, when the sea breeze carries moisture from the Gulf inland. Largo's record low is {{convert|22|F}}, recorded on December 13, 1962. Largo's record high is {{convert|100|F}}, recorded on July 5, 1995.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color: #000080\" height=\"17\" | Month\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jan\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Feb\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Mar\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Apr\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | May\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jun\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Jul\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Aug\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Sep\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Oct\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Nov\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Dec\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Year\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Average high [\u00b0F]\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color:#000080;\" | 69\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 75\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 80\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 86\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 89\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 90\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 90\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 88\n| style=\"background: #FF9900; color:#000080;\" | 83\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color:#000080;\" | 80\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" height=\"16;\" | Average low temperature [\u00b0F]\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 54\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 55\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 60\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color: black;\" | 65\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 71\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 75\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 77\n| style=\"background: #FFCC00; color: black;\" | 76\n| style=\"background: #FFee66; color: black;\" | 70\n| style=\"background: #FFFF66; color: black;\" | 63\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\" | 56\n| style=\"background: #FFff66; color: black;\" | 66\n|-\n! style=\"background: #99CCCC; color:#000080;\" | Rainfall (inches)\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.76\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.87\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 3.29\n| style=\"background: #ccffff;\" | 1.92\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.80\n| style=\"background: #6688FF;\" | 6.09\n| style=\"background: #6688FF;\" | 6.72\n| style=\"background: #0011FF;\" | 8.26\n| style=\"background: #0055FF;\" | 7.59\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.64\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.04\n| style=\"background: #66FFFF;\" | 2.60\n| style=\"background: #0033FF;\" | 49.58\n|}\n<!-- Yahoo Weather. http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USFL0271_f.html. online.

As of the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 77,648,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Largo city, Florida| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> up from 69,371 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]].\n\nLargo was first incorporated in 1905. In 1913, it became the first municipality in Pinellas County to adopt a [[council-manager government]]. It switched back and forth from \"town\" to \"city\" a few times, and became a city again in 1974. It was an exporter of agricultural products until the 1960s population growth began to transform it into a [[commuter town|bedroom community]]. From 1905 to 2010, Largo grew in area from {{convert|9/16|sqmi|km2}} to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}}, and in population from about 300 people to more than 70,000. Largo began as a rural farming community and became the third largest city in Florida's most densely populated county.\n\nLargo is a [[sister city]] to [[Tosayamada, K\u014dchi]], Japan. In 2007, Largo was named a National [[Arbor Day]] Tree City for the 28th year in a row and is the only city in Tampa Bay that is a Sterling Tree City.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings of the area===\n{{Main|Timeline of Largo history}}\nThe native inhabitants of the Largo area were the [[Tocobaga]] Indians. They are also known as the Safety Harbor culture from their archeological remains near present-day [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]]. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] came to Florida in the 16th century.  In the 18th century, the Tocobaga had been virtually destroyed after years of exposure to European diseases, Spanish settlement efforts and warfare between Spain and England. The Largo area, like the rest of Pinellas County, was largely deserted.  In 1763, Spain transferred sovereignty of Florida to The United Kingdom. In 1783, Florida fell to Spanish sovereignty once again until it was transferred to the United States in 1821. By 1845, a surveyor recorded the location of Lake Tolulu, apparently south of present-day East Bay Drive and roughly where the Largo Central Park Nature Preserve is today.\n\n[[Image:Largo Central Park Nature Preserve01.JPG|thumb|right|Boardwalk across wetlands in Largo Central Park Nature Preserve, the bed of former Lake Largo]]\nLater, homesteaders to the Largo area were the families of James and Daniel McMullen around 1852. The McMullens and other settlers raised cattle, grew citrus and vegetables and fished. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Largo area residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. James and Daniel McMullen were members of the [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|\"Cow Cavalry\"]] driving Florida cattle to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]] to help sustain the war effort.  Other area residents served on [[blockade runner]]s.  Still others left the area to serve in the Confederacy's armies. After the war, Largo area residents returned to farming, ranching, and raising citrus. The [[Orange Belt Railway]] reached the area in 1888. By this time Lake Tolulu had been renamed Lake Largo, and residents of the community west of the lake adopted the name \"Largo\".\n\n===Early Largo===\n[[Image:Largo, florida city hall 02small.jpg|thumb|left|Largo City Hall]]\nThe Town of Largo was incorporated in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 to make way for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo's population increased about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo's economy was based on agriculture\u2014[[citrus]] groves, [[cattle ranch]]es, and [[Pig farming|hog farms]], as well as [[turpentine]] stills and [[sawmill]]s. Largo is best remembered as \"Citrus City\", from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and shipping center.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] was unkind to Largo. Largo lacked the financial resources to meet its obligations.  Largo reverted to its 1913 boundaries and [[charter]]. The population dropped approximately 30%. The debt incurred by the issuance of bonds in the late 1920s was not paid off until after [[World War II]].\n\n===Rapid growth ===\n[[Image:Taylor Park, Largo, florida01small.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Lake Park is a county park in Largo on 8th Avenue SW]]\nThe years after [[World War II]] saw rapid growth as people began moving into the area and Largo annexed surrounding lands. During the [[nuclear arms race]], electronics companies like [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]] boosted the economy. The population increased to about 5,000 in 1960, to about 20,000 in 1970, and to about 70,000 in 2005. Largo's original area was 9/16th of a square mile. By 1982, Largo had grown to about {{convert|13|sqmi|km2|0}} and to about {{convert|48|km2|order=flip|0}} in 2010. The groves, farms, ranches and forests have mostly given way to homes and shopping centers and light industry. The increased population resulted in a need for increased city services. All departments saw rapid growth and improvements in quality, especially under the leadership of the late Mayor Thom Feaster. In 1995, Largo Central Park opened on the site of the old Pinellas County Fairgrounds. It is the setting for the Largo Central Park Performing Arts Center and the Largo Public Library.\n\nIn the 2006 commission elections, Largo achieved two milestones furthering its former motto of \"City of Progress\". [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patricia Gerard]] became the city's first female mayor. She narrowly defeated incumbent mayor [[Robert E. Jackson]], in a bitterly contested race. (Dr. Jackson had been the longest serving elected Democrat in Pinellas County.) The voters' choice between these two candidates decided the major issue of the election:  that the city would not revert to a mayor-dominated process of governance in lieu of the continuing role for the seven-member commission acting as non-partisans\u2014that is, deliberating independently and equally with the mayor and deciding democratically the political issues of the city.\n\nAlso, the city elected its first commissioner of [[African-American]] descent, Rodney J. Woods, in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] against a former commissioner.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the iconic Largo [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]], which was constructed shortly after completion of Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the change because of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection was not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.<ref name=\"Its time for Largo clock tower to go\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article1000360.ece |title=Removal of Largo Clock Tower |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLargo is located at {{Coord|27|54|30|N|82|46|40|W}} (27.908355, \u221282.777791).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is centrally located in Pinellas County, touching the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the southwest and [[Tampa Bay]] to the northeast.

Ry\u014d\u014dki}}, known as simply '''''Tenchi Muyo!''''' in North America, is a collection of Japanese [[Original video animation|OVA]]s created by [[Masaki Kajishima]] and animated by [[Anime International Company|AIC]]. Initially released in 1992, it marked the beginning of the ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'' franchise, composed of several [[manga]], OVAs, TV series, and other related media. The first two OVA series were later licensed and distributed in North America by [[Geneon|Pioneer Entertainment]], with [[Funimation]] taking over the rights for the third series, and later taking over the rights for the first two OVAs.\n\nThe distribution of the first OVA series was originally started in September 1992 and released six episodes that lasted until 1993. The first series was so successful that a seventh special episode was released in September 1993, followed by a second OVA series with six additional episodes that begun distribution in September 1994 and lasted for one year until September 1995. However, the second OVA series ended on a cliffhanger and it was not until nearly eight years later in 2003 that a third OVA series was distributed in Japan. The third OVA series continued the ''Tenchi Muyo'' OVA storyline with six episodes, followed by a special episode released in September 2005 that concluded the third OVA storyline.\n\nThe ''Ultimate Collection'' box set release of the first two OVAs from [[Geneon]] was one of the few releases from the company to feature [[THX]]-certified audio and video.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, a fourth OVA series was announced to be in production,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-10-16/4th-tenchi-muyo-ryo-ohki-announced-after-10-years/.94304 |title=4th Tenchi Muyo!

OVA Season Previewed in 3 More Promo Videos|author= Hodgkins, Crystalyn|date= December 13, 2019|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|accessdate= December 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Tenchi Muyo! characters}}\n===Protagonists===\n; [[Tenchi Masaki]]\n: A teenager who accidentally releases the space pirate [[Ryoko (Tenchi Muyo!)|Ryoko]]. His actions unintentionally cause the destruction of his school and the revelation that he is part-Juraian and a member of their royal family. In the 1st OVA it is revealed that he can create Light Hawk Wings (the power of the goddesses and Jurai ships) without the aid of a royal tree, and can also perform energy-matter conversion.\n; [[Ryoko (Tenchi Muyo!)|Ryoko Hakubi]]\n: A creation of the scientist [[Washu Hakubi]] (of her own egg and a substance called Masu) Ryoko was a space pirate in the service of Kagato until she was sealed in a cave for 700 years, she is released by Tenchi in the first episode. She draws most of her powers from three mysterious gems and is partnered with the [[cabbit]] spaceship Ryo-Ohki.\n; [[Ryo-Ohki]]\n: The title character appears as a grey-colored cabbit (a cross between a cat and rabbit), and can transform into a spaceship. \n; [[Ayeka Masaki Jurai]]\n: A princess of the Juraian Royal Family, she is searching the galaxy for her half-brother and future betrothed Yosho with her sister Sasami when she detects Ryoko (whom Yosho had been pursuing prior to his disappearance) her tree-ship Ryu-Oh crashes on Earth, where she reluctantly joins Tenchi and Ryoko.\n; [[Sasami Masaki Jurai]]\n: Ayeka's younger sister, and also a princess of the Juraian Royal Family. She stows away on Ayeka's ship prior to the search for Yosho. She has also merged with the Goddess [[Tsunami (Tenchi Muyo!)|Tsunami]], which grants the Jurai family its royal trees. Sasami frequently cooks for the household.\n; [[Mihoshi Kuramitsu]]\n: A member of the powerful Kuramitsu family of the Seniwa empire and a Detective of the Galaxy Police, Mihoshi is prone to clumsiness and can act ditzy, despite being highly intelligent. Mihoshi is distantly related to Washu, and through that lineage has the power of improbably good luck. She crashes on Earth while looking for Kagato.\n; [[Washu Hakubi]]\n: A former Director of the Galaxy Academy and ranked as the top scientist in the universe, Washu's more recent pursuits involve investigating the three gems (the ones Ryoko were given) and creating lifeforms capable of harnessing their power (of which the Ryoko/Ryo-Ohki combination is one). She was trapped by Kagato and later released by Mihoshi. It is revealed in OVA 3 that Washu is a human manifestation of a sister-goddess to Tsunami and Tokimi.\n; [[Noike Kamiki Jurai]]\n: Noike Kamiki Jurai was raised in an orphanage, and later joined the Galaxy Police. She was Mihoshi's partner and was adopted by Seto Kamiki Jurai, Ayeka and Sasami's grandmother, and is introduced as Tenchi's fianc\u00e9e in OVA 3. The engagement, however, is a political pretense to allow her to monitor the powerful members of the household.\n\n===Villains and antagonists===\n; Kagato\n: A former student of Washu (revealed in spin-off media as a creation of hers) In the pursuit of science he frequently pillages ruins for relics with no regard to life or property, earning him the nickname 'Ruins Buster' and status of Eternally Wanted by the Galaxy Police. Kagato is the main antagonist of the 1st OVA making an attempt to recover Ryoko (whom he previously brainwashed into serving him) and use the power of her gems to capture Tsunami.\n; Doctor Clay\n: A former colleague and academic rival of Washu from the Galaxy Academy, he is in service to Lady Tokimi in OVA 2 (in which he is the primary adversary) and is ordered by her to capture Washu and bring her to Tokimi. Clay uses the shape-shifting android [[Zero (Tenchi Muyo!)|Zero]] to replace Ryoko and capture Washu. However he is outsmarted by Washu, captured and handed over to the Galaxy Police.\n; Tokimi\n: {{nihongo|Tokimi|\u8a2a\u5e0c\u6df1|}} is a mysterious hyperdimensional being (stated to be beyond all dimensional space) who is one of the \"Choushin\", the greatest \"goddesses\" in existence. Her sisters are [[Tsunami (Tenchi Muyo!)|Tsunami]] and [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]]. Introduced in the second OVA series, where she orders [[Doctor Clay|Dr. Clay]] to bring [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]] to her. Tokimi is not portrayed as an antagonist in the 3rd OVA, since she considers Tenchi as the result of their research to find a being even more powerful than herself, theorising that it might have created the Choushin themselves. While Tsunami and Washu were experimenting within the lower universes to try to discover an even higher level being, Tokimi was left in-charge of all [[Projective geometry|22-dimensional]] reality and controls it from the Hyper-dimension through higher-dimensional supervisors to conduct higher order chaos experiments. Though Tokimi's actions lead to trouble for Tenchi and his group, Tokimi turns out not to be a true villain as there was no malice in her actions but simply lacked the wisdom of her sisters. Tokimi now currently lives with the Tenchi family, as a smaller form, Toki-Chan.\n: {{Voiced by|[[Yumi T\u014dma]]|[[Jennifer Darling]] (OVA 2), [[Mari Devon]] (OVA 3)}}\n; Z\n: {{nihongo|Z|\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8|Zetto}} (full name Z-0001332536893) is the principal antagonist of the third OVA series of ''Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki''. An anomalous being of great power, capable of punching holes through planets seemingly without effort.  He is capable of creating Lighthawk Wings created through the experiments of Lady Tokimi. Throughout the 3rd OVA, he stalks Tenchi and his household, setting up a confrontation between Tenchi and Misao Kuramitsu and ultimately battling Tenchi to prove his superiority and disrupt the choushin plans. Z is portrayed as suffering from the loss of his family and resentful of the Goddesses and their meddling, despite serving Tokimi.\n: {{Voiced by|Eiji Hanawa|Brad MacDonald}}\n; The Counter-Actor\n: The {{nihongo|Counter-Actor|\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u4f53|Hansay\u014dtai}} is an anomalous being created as the sum total sentient \"counter-force\" from the Choushin Goddesses' sum total experimentation on 22-dimensional reality, and somehow merging with queen Misaki of Jurai. It is capable of causing their lower-dimensional shadows physical injury (visually appearing to corrupt their body, turning them black). Z found her in the future and used her in his plans to kill Tenchi and stop Tokimi's experiments. The counter-actor is stopped and healed by a kiss from the ascended future Tenchi and is revealed to be Masaki [[Misaki Jurai]] (The 2nd Empress of Jurai and mother of Ayeka and Sasami) from some point in the future.\n: Background information released by the series creator indicates the Counter-Actor is from a point in the distant future (ten thousand years or more) when both her husband Azusa, and her co-wife Funaho have passed on, which caused Misaki to eventually go mad from her grief and destructive power. According to this information, during his time travel after being struck by Z's Light Hawk Wing, Tenchi was to encounter Misaki in her future time. Unfortunately, while planned, it was cut from the OVA.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Minor===\nFor other characters within the OVA continuity that make a brief appearance in the OVA series, see also: ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

The Toonami version was heavily edited for content and to remove blood, profanity and nudity, as well as to shorten the length of the episodes to fit broadcast standards, and featured custom opening and closing credits.  The series also ran on [[CNX (TV channel)|CNX]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].\n\nAfter Cartoon Network's rights to broadcast the show expired, the now-defunct [[AZN Television|International Channel]] (later AZN Television) picked up the rights to air the dubbed version in 2004.\n\nAs of April 1, 2012, only one episode of OVA 3 has aired on basic cable television in the United States. However, the [[Funimation Channel]] had the third season in rotation for a time.\n\n==''Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special''==\n{{nihongo|'''''Tenchi Muyo!

Special: Creation of the Universe Journey across Space-Time'').\n\n===Synopsis===\nAs usual, [[Mihoshi Kuramitsu]] was asleep on the deck of the house while everyone else (with the notable exception of [[Ryoko (Tenchi Muyo!)|Ryoko]]) was doing chores.  After [[Ayeka Masaki Jurai|Ayeka]] questions Mihoshi's qualifications of being a Galaxy Policewoman, Mihoshi then tells the story of her and her partner Kiyone's greatest adventure: the \"Ultra-Energy Matter\" caper.\n\nIn the story, Mihoshi casts the Masaki household as the various characters in the story: Ryoko as the thief, [[Tenchi Masaki|Tenchi]] as a Galaxy Policeman, Ayeka as Tenchi's heiress fianc\u00e9e, Sasami as an apprentice detective, [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]] as a mad scientist (not a far stretch of the imagination), and [[Ryo-Ohki]] as... Ryo-Ohki.  As the investigation progresses (not to mention romantic rivalries between \"Ryoko\" and \"Ayeka\"), the detectives stumble onto a plot to destroy the universe.\n\n==Music==\n<!-- Does not conform to [[WP:ACCESS]].

Ry\u014d\u014dki}}, known as simply '''''Tenchi Muyo!''''' in North America, is a collection of Japanese [[Original video animation|OVA]]s created by [[Masaki Kajishima]] and animated by [[Anime International Company|AIC]]. Initially released in 1992, it marked the beginning of the ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'' franchise, composed of several [[manga]], OVAs, TV series, and other related media. The first two OVA series were later licensed and distributed in North America by [[Geneon|Pioneer Entertainment]], with [[Funimation]] taking over the rights for the third series, and later taking over the rights for the first two OVAs.\n\nThe distribution of the first OVA series was originally started in September 1992 and released six episodes that lasted until 1993. The first series was so successful that a seventh special episode was released in September 1993, followed by a second OVA series with six additional episodes that begun distribution in September 1994 and lasted for one year until September 1995. However, the second OVA series ended on a cliffhanger and it was not until nearly eight years later in 2003 that a third OVA series was distributed in Japan. The third OVA series continued the ''Tenchi Muyo'' OVA storyline with six episodes, followed by a special episode released in September 2005 that concluded the third OVA storyline.\n\nThe ''Ultimate Collection'' box set release of the first two OVAs from [[Geneon]] was one of the few releases from the company to feature [[THX]]-certified audio and video.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, a fourth OVA series was announced to be in production,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-10-16/4th-tenchi-muyo-ryo-ohki-announced-after-10-years/.94304 |title=4th Tenchi Muyo!

His actions unintentionally cause the destruction of his school and the revelation that he is part-Juraian and a member of their royal family. In the 1st OVA it is revealed that he can create Light Hawk Wings (the power of the goddesses and Jurai ships) without the aid of a royal tree, and can also perform energy-matter conversion.\n; [[Ryoko (Tenchi Muyo!)|Ryoko Hakubi]]\n: A creation of the scientist [[Washu Hakubi]] (of her own egg and a substance called Masu) Ryoko was a space pirate in the service of Kagato until she was sealed in a cave for 700 years, she is released by Tenchi in the first episode. She draws most of her powers from three mysterious gems and is partnered with the [[cabbit]] spaceship Ryo-Ohki.\n; [[Ryo-Ohki]]\n: The title character appears as a grey-colored cabbit (a cross between a cat and rabbit), and can transform into a spaceship. \n; [[Ayeka Masaki Jurai]]\n: A princess of the Juraian Royal Family, she is searching the galaxy for her half-brother and future betrothed Yosho with her sister Sasami when she detects Ryoko (whom Yosho had been pursuing prior to his disappearance) her tree-ship Ryu-Oh crashes on Earth, where she reluctantly joins Tenchi and Ryoko.\n; [[Sasami Masaki Jurai]]\n: Ayeka's younger sister, and also a princess of the Juraian Royal Family. She stows away on Ayeka's ship prior to the search for Yosho. She has also merged with the Goddess [[Tsunami (Tenchi Muyo!)|Tsunami]], which grants the Jurai family its royal trees. Sasami frequently cooks for the household.\n; [[Mihoshi Kuramitsu]]\n: A member of the powerful Kuramitsu family of the Seniwa empire and a Detective of the Galaxy Police, Mihoshi is prone to clumsiness and can act ditzy, despite being highly intelligent. Mihoshi is distantly related to Washu, and through that lineage has the power of improbably good luck. She crashes on Earth while looking for Kagato.\n; [[Washu Hakubi]]\n: A former Director of the Galaxy Academy and ranked as the top scientist in the universe, Washu's more recent pursuits involve investigating the three gems (the ones Ryoko were given) and creating lifeforms capable of harnessing their power (of which the Ryoko/Ryo-Ohki combination is one). She was trapped by Kagato and later released by Mihoshi. It is revealed in OVA 3 that Washu is a human manifestation of a sister-goddess to Tsunami and Tokimi.\n; [[Noike Kamiki Jurai]]\n: Noike Kamiki Jurai was raised in an orphanage, and later joined the Galaxy Police. She was Mihoshi's partner and was adopted by Seto Kamiki Jurai, Ayeka and Sasami's grandmother, and is introduced as Tenchi's fianc\u00e9e in OVA 3. The engagement, however, is a political pretense to allow her to monitor the powerful members of the household.\n\n===Villains and antagonists===\n; Kagato\n: A former student of Washu (revealed in spin-off media as a creation of hers) In the pursuit of science he frequently pillages ruins for relics with no regard to life or property, earning him the nickname 'Ruins Buster' and status of Eternally Wanted by the Galaxy Police. Kagato is the main antagonist of the 1st OVA making an attempt to recover Ryoko (whom he previously brainwashed into serving him) and use the power of her gems to capture Tsunami.\n; Doctor Clay\n: A former colleague and academic rival of Washu from the Galaxy Academy, he is in service to Lady Tokimi in OVA 2 (in which he is the primary adversary) and is ordered by her to capture Washu and bring her to Tokimi. Clay uses the shape-shifting android [[Zero (Tenchi Muyo!)|Zero]] to replace Ryoko and capture Washu. However he is outsmarted by Washu, captured and handed over to the Galaxy Police.\n; Tokimi\n: {{nihongo|Tokimi|\u8a2a\u5e0c\u6df1|}} is a mysterious hyperdimensional being (stated to be beyond all dimensional space) who is one of the \"Choushin\", the greatest \"goddesses\" in existence. Her sisters are [[Tsunami (Tenchi Muyo!)|Tsunami]] and [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]]. Introduced in the second OVA series, where she orders [[Doctor Clay|Dr. Clay]] to bring [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]] to her. Tokimi is not portrayed as an antagonist in the 3rd OVA, since she considers Tenchi as the result of their research to find a being even more powerful than herself, theorising that it might have created the Choushin themselves. While Tsunami and Washu were experimenting within the lower universes to try to discover an even higher level being, Tokimi was left in-charge of all [[Projective geometry|22-dimensional]] reality and controls it from the Hyper-dimension through higher-dimensional supervisors to conduct higher order chaos experiments. Though Tokimi's actions lead to trouble for Tenchi and his group, Tokimi turns out not to be a true villain as there was no malice in her actions but simply lacked the wisdom of her sisters. Tokimi now currently lives with the Tenchi family, as a smaller form, Toki-Chan.\n: {{Voiced by|[[Yumi T\u014dma]]|[[Jennifer Darling]] (OVA 2), [[Mari Devon]] (OVA 3)}}\n; Z\n: {{nihongo|Z|\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8|Zetto}} (full name Z-0001332536893) is the principal antagonist of the third OVA series of ''Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki''. An anomalous being of great power, capable of punching holes through planets seemingly without effort.  He is capable of creating Lighthawk Wings created through the experiments of Lady Tokimi. Throughout the 3rd OVA, he stalks Tenchi and his household, setting up a confrontation between Tenchi and Misao Kuramitsu and ultimately battling Tenchi to prove his superiority and disrupt the choushin plans. Z is portrayed as suffering from the loss of his family and resentful of the Goddesses and their meddling, despite serving Tokimi.\n: {{Voiced by|Eiji Hanawa|Brad MacDonald}}\n; The Counter-Actor\n: The {{nihongo|Counter-Actor|\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u4f53|Hansay\u014dtai}} is an anomalous being created as the sum total sentient \"counter-force\" from the Choushin Goddesses' sum total experimentation on 22-dimensional reality, and somehow merging with queen Misaki of Jurai. It is capable of causing their lower-dimensional shadows physical injury (visually appearing to corrupt their body, turning them black). Z found her in the future and used her in his plans to kill Tenchi and stop Tokimi's experiments. The counter-actor is stopped and healed by a kiss from the ascended future Tenchi and is revealed to be Masaki [[Misaki Jurai]] (The 2nd Empress of Jurai and mother of Ayeka and Sasami) from some point in the future.\n: Background information released by the series creator indicates the Counter-Actor is from a point in the distant future (ten thousand years or more) when both her husband Azusa, and her co-wife Funaho have passed on, which caused Misaki to eventually go mad from her grief and destructive power. According to this information, during his time travel after being struck by Z's Light Hawk Wing, Tenchi was to encounter Misaki in her future time. Unfortunately, while planned, it was cut from the OVA.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Minor===\nFor other characters within the OVA continuity that make a brief appearance in the OVA series, see also: ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

The Toonami version was heavily edited for content and to remove blood, profanity and nudity, as well as to shorten the length of the episodes to fit broadcast standards, and featured custom opening and closing credits.  The series also ran on [[CNX (TV channel)|CNX]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].\n\nAfter Cartoon Network's rights to broadcast the show expired, the now-defunct [[AZN Television|International Channel]] (later AZN Television) picked up the rights to air the dubbed version in 2004.\n\nAs of April 1, 2012, only one episode of OVA 3 has aired on basic cable television in the United States.

Bangai-hen: Uch\u016b Keiji Mihoshi Ginga Daib\u014dken}} is a special episode of the series.\n\nThe special features the anime debut of [[Kiyone Makibi]] and [[Sasami Masaki Jurai|Sasami]]'s alter-ego, [[Magical Girl Pretty Sammy|Pretty Sammy]] (the latter made her debut in the Tenchi Muyo! drama CD, ''Tenchi Muyo! Special: Creation of the Universe Journey across Space-Time'').\n\n===Synopsis===\nAs usual, [[Mihoshi Kuramitsu]] was asleep on the deck of the house while everyone else (with the notable exception of [[Ryoko (Tenchi Muyo!)|Ryoko]]) was doing chores.  After [[Ayeka Masaki Jurai|Ayeka]] questions Mihoshi's qualifications of being a Galaxy Policewoman, Mihoshi then tells the story of her and her partner Kiyone's greatest adventure: the \"Ultra-Energy Matter\" caper.\n\nIn the story, Mihoshi casts the Masaki household as the various characters in the story: Ryoko as the thief, [[Tenchi Masaki|Tenchi]] as a Galaxy Policeman, Ayeka as Tenchi's heiress fianc\u00e9e, Sasami as an apprentice detective, [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]] as a mad scientist (not a far stretch of the imagination), and [[Ryo-Ohki]] as... Ryo-Ohki.  As the investigation progresses (not to mention romantic rivalries between \"Ryoko\" and \"Ayeka\"), the detectives stumble onto a plot to destroy the universe.\n\n==Music==\n<!-- Does not conform to [[WP:ACCESS]].

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2017, he flew to the Philippines to study English.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=I'm back on YouTube!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCGuUXSewvc|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila for his English lessons. \n\nHe learnt of the PBB audition from his Filipino followers. He attended and documented his audition for his vlog content but he was able to pass all the screenings and became an official PBB OTSO housemate.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter PBB, he stayed in the Philippines to pursue a career in show-business.\n<br />\n\n==Career==\n\n===YouTube===\n\nFumiya established his YouTube channel, '''FumiShun Base''', with his brother Shunya on December 2, 2015, but only posted their first video on September 6, 2016. \n\nWhile studying in the Philippines, he continued to upload videos in his YouTube channel as a means to update his parents of his whereabouts. \n\nHe started uploading YouTube contents for Filipinos on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2017. His first video was a reaction video of [[Sarah Geronimo]]'s [[Kilometro (song)|Kilometro]]. From then on, he started gaining Filipino followers.\n\nOn April 2018, his channel hit 100K subscribers awarding him with the YouTube Silver play button.<ref>{{Citation|title=MARAMING SALAMAT PO!!!!!!!!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9htbO1t6M|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> On March 7, 2019, he hit the one million subscribers mark, awarding him with a gold play button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/news/fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-subscribers-on-youtub-47849|title=Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million subscribers on YouTube! {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://push.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/fresh-scoops/pbb-housemate-fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-youtube-203967|title=PBB housemate Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million Youtube subscribers {{!}} PUSH.COM.PH: Your ultimate showbiz hub!|last=TEAM|first=PUSH|website=push.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome notable vlogs were his song covers of [[I\u00f1igo Pascual]]\u2019s [[Dahil Sa'yo|Dahil Sayo]], [[Daniel Padilla]]\u2019s [[Simpleng Tulad Mo]], [[Juan Karlos Labajo|Juan Karlos]]\u2019 Buwan, [[Maja Salvador]]\u2019s Dahan Dahan, and [[Ex Battalion|Ex Battallion]]\u2019s [[Hayaan Mo Sila]] which was featured in [[Rated K]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/03/18/18/viral-japanese-guy-covers-hayaan-mo-sila|title=VIRAL: Japanese guy covers 'Hayaan Mo Sila'|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/videos/44040719-the-life-of-andre-lou-fumiya-and-yamyam-before-joining-pbb-226307|title=Rated K: The life of Andre, Lou, Fumiya and Yamyam before joining PBB {{!}} ABS-CBN Entertainment|website=ent.abs-cbn.com|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOther notable vlogs are his auditions to [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|PBB Otso]] in Araneta Cubao and Cebu.\n\nWhen the channel started, Japanese was the primary language used in his videos. English subtitles were added since most of his subscribers were Filipinos. After his stint in PBB, he shifted to a mixture of English and Tagalog. Subtitles were no longer added. \n\nThis posed a problem for his growing fanbase. With the growing demand from Japanese subscribers, he established the '''Hiragana FumiShun Base''' '''(\u3075\u307f\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3079\u30fc\u3059)''' YouTube Channel on April 13, 2020. This channel uses pure Japanese.\n\n===Business===\nFumiya\u2019s dream was to establish his very own clothing line. Most of his business ventures are aligned to this dream.\n\nFumiya opened the official shop for his YouTube channel on June 22, 2019.
