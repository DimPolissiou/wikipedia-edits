Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias  returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.\n\n== Greek legend ==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias..gif|thumb|Damon and Pythias]]\nAs told by [[Aristoxenus]], and after him [[Cicero]] (''De Offic.'' 3.45), [[Diodorus Siculus]] (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], traveled to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the reign of the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]] (r. 405&ndash;367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.\n\nAccepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell.  Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released.\n\nDionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution\u2014but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.\n\nApologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. \n\nSo astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.\n\nAnother version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test\u2014a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Kitty |title=Pythagoras His Lives and the Legacy of a Rational Universe |publisher=Walker |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== Works based on the legend==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias (1914) - 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Still from the film ''Damon and Pythias'' (1914)]]\n*In 1564, the material was made into a [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by the English poet [[Richard Edwardes]] (''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'').\n*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the [[German language|German]] ballad ''[[Die B\u00fcrgschaft]]'',<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_B%C3%BCrgschaft Die B\u00fcrgschaft \u2013 Wikisource].
