The flag's design and symbolism are derived from several sources, but emerged during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The flag is also an international [[Communist symbolism|symbol]] of the [[communist movement]] as a whole. The nicknames for the flag were '''The Hammer and Sickle''' and '''The Red Banner'''.\n\nThe design is a solid field of [[Red (color)|red]] adorned with a unique [[Gold (color)|gold]] emblem in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|upper hoist quarter]]. The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] was a traditional [[revolution]]ary symbol long before 1917, and its incorporation into the flag paid tribute to the international aspect of workers' revolution. The iconic [[hammer and sickle]] design was a modern industrial touch adopted from the Russian Revolution. The union of the hammer ([[workers]]) and the sickle ([[peasants]]) represents the victorious and enduring revolutionary alliance. The famous emblem is topped by a gold-bordered [[red star]] representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first flag was adopted in December 1922. In 1955, a statute on the flag was adopted which resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle.

It was ordered with the unusual ratio of 4:1 in proportion and consisted of a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with the state coat of arms in the center.

The flag's design and symbolism are derived from several sources, but emerged during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The flag is also an international [[Communist symbolism|symbol]] of the [[communist movement]] as a whole. The nicknames for the flag were '''The Hammer and Sickle''' and '''The Red Banner'''.\n\nThe design is a solid field of [[Red (color)|red]] adorned with a unique [[Gold (color)|gold]] emblem in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|upper hoist quarter]]. The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] was a traditional [[revolution]]ary symbol long before 1917, and its incorporation into the flag paid tribute to the international aspect of workers' revolution. The iconic [[hammer and sickle]] design was a modern industrial touch adopted from the Russian Revolution. The union of the hammer ([[workers]]) and the sickle ([[peasants]]) represents the victorious and enduring revolutionary alliance. The famous emblem is topped by a gold-bordered [[red star]] representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first flag was adopted in December 1922. In 1955, a statute on the flag was adopted which resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle.

This flag was the official flag for four months, and was replaced as the official flag by the more familiar [[hammer and sickle]] design during the third session of the CIK of the USSR on 12 November 1923.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131923).svg|December 1922<br>\u2014<br>12 November 1923\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924).svg|12 November 1923<br>\u2014<br>18 April 1924\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924\u20131936).svg|18 April 1924<br>\u2014<br>5 December 1936\n}}\n\nIn the third session of the CIK of the USSR, the description of Soviet flag in the Constitution was changed, and article 71 was edited to be: 'The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a red or scarlet field, and in the canton a golden sickle and hammer, and a red five-pointed star bordered in gold above them.  The ratio of width to length is 1:2.'  On 19 August 1955 \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted by a decision of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].  This resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle. On August 15, 1980, a new edition of the \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted, which did not make any changes to the flag's description aside from removing the hammer and sickle on the reverse side of the flag.<ref name=RCVH></ref> From this point on, the flag stayed in use with this design until the disintegration of the USSR on 26 December 1991, at which time it ceased to be a national flag and replaced by national flags of the [[post-Soviet republics]].\n<center>\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1936\u20131955).svg |5 December 1936<br>\u2014<br>19 August 1955\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg |19 August 1955<br>\u2014<br>26 December 1991\n}}\n</center>\nToday, the Soviet flag is used by the opposition, mainly left-wing rallies and demonstrations in the former Soviet space.

Fortitude was divided into two sub-plans, North and South, with the aim of misleading the German high command as to the location of the invasion.\n\nBoth Fortitude plans involved the creation of phantom [[field armies]] (based in [[Edinburgh]] and the south of England) which threatened [[Norway]] ([[Fortitude North]]) and [[Pas de Calais]] ([[Fortitude South]]). The operation was intended to divert Axis attention away from Normandy and, after the invasion on 6 June 1944, to delay reinforcement by convincing the Germans that the landings were purely a diversionary attack.\n\n==Background==\nFortitude was one of the major elements of [[Operation Bodyguard]], the overall Allied deception stratagem for the Normandy landings. Bodyguard's main objective was to ensure the Germans would not increase troop presence in Normandy and to do so by promoting the appearance that the Allied forces would attack in other locations. NOAH BENJAMIN STEPHENS IS A LEGEND.\n\nAfter the 6 June 1944 invasion, the plan was to delay movement of German reserves to the Normandy beachhead and to prevent a potentially-disastrous counterattack. Fortitude's objectives were to promote alternative targets of Norway and Calais.<ref name=Jablonsky>Jablonsky 1991</ref><ref name=BrownPrologue>Brown 1975, pp. 1\u201310</ref>\n\nThe planning of Operation Fortitude came under the auspices of the [[London Controlling Section]] (LCS), a secret body that was set up to manage Allied deception strategy during the war. However, the execution of each plan fell to the various [[theater (warfare)|theatre]] commanders; in the case of Fortitude, it was [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) under General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. A special section, [[Ops (B)]], was established at SHAEF to handle the operation and all of the theatre's deception warfare. The LCS retained responsibility for what was called \"special means\", the use of diplomatic channels and double agents.<ref name=BrownPrologue/>\n\nFortitude was split into two parts, North and South, both with similar aims. Fortitude North was intended to convince the [[German High Command]] that the Allies, staging out of Scotland, would attempt an invasion of [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]]. Fortitude South employed the same tactic, with the apparent objective being [[Pas de Calais]].<ref name=Jablonsky/>\n\n==Planning==\nPlanning was ostensibly the responsibility of [[Noel Wild]] and his Ops (B) staff. However, in practice, the work was shared between Wild and the heads of the LCS and B1a. Work began in December 1943, at first under the codename Mespot. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] judged that to be unsuitable and so the Fortitude name was adopted on February 18.<ref group=note>SHAEF was offered a list of names to choose from; Bulldog, Axehead, Swordhilt, Fortitude and Ignite</ref><ref name=Levine202/>\n\n===Fortitude South===\nWild's first version of the Fortitude South plan was produced in early January 1943 and aimed to counter the likelihood that the Germans would notice invasion preparations in the southern England.<ref name=Holt531/> The intention was to create the impression that an invasion was aimed at the Pas-de-Calais sometime in mid-July. Once the real invasion had landed, six fictional divisions would keep the threat to Calais alive.<ref name=Levine203/> The Fortitude South plan would be implemented, at an operational level, by the invasion force, the [[21st Army Group]] under the command of General [[Bernard Montgomery]].<ref name=Levine202/>\n\nThat presented a problem in the form of Colonel [[David Strangeways]], head of Montgomery's [[R Force]] deception staff.<ref name=Levine202/> Strangeways had, in the opinion of Ops(B)'s Christopher Harmer, the same arrogance as his commanding officer. More importantly, he held a low opinion of the London establishment of the \"old boys'\" clubs of Ops (B) and LCS. Dissatisfied with the Fortitude South outline, he, in the words of Harmer, set out to ride \"roughshod over the established deception organization\".<ref name=Levine203/> Strangeways's criticisms highlighted that the plan aimed to cover the Allies' real intentions, rather than to create a realistic threat to Calais.{{elucidate|date=February 2015}}<ref name=Levine203/><ref name=Holt532/> That was not the only issue, and Strangeways was not the only one to notice them.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} If the Germans were able to judge the Allied state of readiness in southwestern England, they would be expecting an invasion in early June,{{why|date=February 2015}} which left several weeks to defeat any bridgehead and tot,urn to the defence of Calais.<ref name=Holt532/>\n\n[[File:DecoyLCT.jpg|thumb|Dummy landing craft]]\nOn 25 Januato Montgomery's Chief of Staff, [[Freddie de Guingand|Francis de Guingand]], sent a letter to the deception planners that included asking them to focus on Pas-de-Calais as the main assault; it was almost certainly sent at the behest of Strangeways.<ref name=Holt533/> With those criticisms in hand, Wild produced his final draft for Fortitude South. In the revised plan, issued on 30 January and approved by the Allied chiefs on 18 February, fifty divisions would be positioned in Southern England to attack Pas de Calais.<ref name=Levine203/><ref name=Holt533/> After the real invasion had landed, the story would change, suggesting to the Germans that several assault divisions remained in England that were ready to conduct a cross-channel attack once the Normandy beachhead had drawn German defences away from Calais. The plan still retained some of its earlier form, most notably since the first part of the story still aimed to suggest an invasion date of mid-July.<ref name=Holt534/> \n\nStrangeways was still unimpressed. He pointed out that convincing the Germans of so many fictional divisions would be tough and that even That would be easier than convincing them of Montgomery's ability to manage two entire invasions at the same time.<ref name=Levine205/> Wild's plan outlined ten divisions for the Calais assault, six of them fictional and the remainder being the real American V Corps and British I Corps. However, the corps would be part of the actual Normandy invasion and so it would be difficult to imply Calais being the main assault after D-Day.<ref name=Holt535/> Strangeways's final concerns related to the effort required for physical deception, as the plan called for large numbers of troop movements and dummy craft.<ref name=Levine205/>\n{{quotebox\n|quote  = I rewrote it entirely. It was too complicated, and the people who made it had not never done it before. Now they did their best - but it didn't suit the operation that Monty was considering.... You see so much depended on the success of that deception plan.\n|source = Strangeways, writing in 1996<ref name=Levine208/>\n|width  = 33%\n|align = right}}\n\nStrangeways's objections were so strong that he refused to undertake most of the physical deception. A power struggle ensued throughout February and early March, between Ops(B) and Strangeways as to who had authority to implement each part of the deception plan.  Montgomery put his full support behind his head of deception and so Strangeways prevailed.<ref name=Holt536/><ref name=Levine206/> Finally, in a 23 February meeting between R Force and Ops(B), Strangeways tore up a copy of the plan, decreeing it useless, and announced that he would rewrite it from scratch.<ref name=Levine205/>\n\n[[File:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|A dummy [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] tank]]\nThe established deceivers were dubious about Strangeways's announcement and assumed he would resubmit the existing plan with some modifications.<ref name=Levine206/> However, he duly submitted a rewritten operation that was met, in Harmer's words, with \"astonishment\".<ref name=Levine208/>\n\nStrangeways's revised Fortitude South invented an entire new field army. The [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG), commanded by Lt. Gen. George Patton, was a skeleton formation formed for administrative purposes but never used. However, the Germans had discovered its existence through radio intercepts. Strangeways proposed activating the unit, with a series of fictional and real formations, to overcome the problem of Montgomery handling two invasions.<ref name=Levine206/> Moreover, he proposed that FUSAG should represent the main Allied threat to the Germans, which they would expect to land around Calais. Once [[Operation Neptune]]'s landings had taken place, that should be passed off as a diversion to distract German defences from the main attack by FUSAG.<ref name=Levine207/>\n\nThe new Fortitude South came with six subsidiary plans, Quicksilver I-VI, with specific implementation details.<ref name=Levine207/>\n\n==Special means==\n[[File:Dummy aircraft - Oct. 1943.jpg|thumb|A dummy aircraft, modelled after the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]], October 1943]]\nFor deceptions, the Allies had developed a number of methodologies, which were referred to as \"special means\". They included combinations of physical deception, fake wireless activity, leaks through diplomatic channels and double agents. Fortitude used all of those techniques to various extents. For example, Fortitude North relied heavily on wireless transmission (the Allies thought that Scotland was too far for German reconnaissance to reach), and Fortitude South used the Allies' network of double agents.\n\n#Physical deception: to mislead the enemy with nonexistent units by fake infrastructure and equipment, such as dummy landing craft, dummy airfields and decoy lighting.\n#Controlled leaks: information would pass through diplomatic channels, which might be passed on via neutral countries to the Germans.\n#Wireless traffic: wireless traffic was created to simulate actual units to mislead the enemy.\n#Using German agents controlled by the Allies through the [[Double Cross System]] to send false information to the German intelligence services.\n#Public presence of notable staff associated with phantom groups such as FUSAG, most notably the well-known US General [[George Patton]].\n\n===Double agents===\nOne of the main deception channels for the Allies was the use of double agents. B1A, the Counter-Intelligence Division of [[MI5]], had done a good job in intercepting all of the German agents in Britain. Many of them were recruited as double agents under the [[Double Cross System]]. These were the three most important double agents during the Fortitude operation:\n*[[Juan Pujol Garc\u00eda]] (Garbo), a Spanish citizen who managed to get recruited by German intelligence, sent them abundant but convincing disinformation from Lisbon until the Allies accepted his offer, and he was employed by the British. He had created a network of 27 imaginary sub-agents by the time of Fortitude, and the Germans unwittingly paid the British Exchequer large amounts of money regularly, thinking they were funding a network that was loyal to themselves. He was awarded both the [[Iron Cross]] by the Germans and an [[MBE]] by the British after [[D-Day]].\n*[[Roman Czerniawski]] (Brutus), a Polish officer who ran an intelligence network for the Allies in occupied France. Captured by the Germans, he was offered a chance to work for them as a spy. On his arrival in Britain, he turned himself in to British intelligence.\n*[[Du\u0161an Popov]] (Tricycle), a Yugoslav lawyer, whose flamboyant lifestyle covered his intelligence activities.\n\n==Fortitude North==\n[[File:EdinburghCastle.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh Castle]], the headquarters of the fictional British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] during Operation Fortitude]]\nFortitude North was designed to mislead the Germans into expecting an invasion of [[Norway]]. By threatening any weakened Norwegian defence, the Allies hoped to prevent or to delay reinforcement of France after the Normandy invasion. The plan involved simulating a buildup of forces in northern England and political contact with Sweden.<ref name=Sexton>Sexton 1983, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring a similar operation in 1943, [[Operation Cockade]], a fictional field army ([[British Fourth Army#Second World War|British Fourth Army]]) had been created, headquartered in [[Edinburgh Castle]].<ref name=HoltTindall>Holt 2004, p. 486</ref> It was decided to continue to use the same force during Fortitude. Unlike its southern counterpart, the deception relied primarily on \"Special Means\" and fake radio traffic since it was judged unlikely that German reconnaissance planes could reach Scotland unintercepted.<ref name=Sexton/><ref name=\"BrownSkye\">Cave Brown 1975</ref> False information about the arrival of troops in the area was reported by double agents [[Mutt and Jeff (spies)|Mutt and Jeff]], who had surrendered following their 1941 landing in the [[Moray Firth]], and the British media co-operated by broadcasting fake information, such as football scores or wedding announcements, to nonexistent troops.<ref name=BrownSkye>Cave Brown 1975</ref>{{rp|464\u2013466}} Fortitude North was so successful that by late spring 1944, Hitler had thirteen army divisions in Norway.<ref>Ambrose, Stephen, D-Day June 6th, 1944 (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994)  p. 82</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1944, British commandos attacked targets in Norway to simulate preparations for invasion. They destroyed industrial targets, such as shipping and power infrastructure, as well as military outposts. That coincided with an increase in naval activity in the northern seas and in political pressure on neutral Sweden.<ref name=BrownSkye/>{{rp|466\u2013467}}\n\n===Operation Skye===\nOperation Skye was the codename for the radio deception component of Fortitude North, involving simulated radio traffic between fictional army units. The programme began on 22 March 1944, overseen by Colonel R. M. McLeod, and became fully operational by 6 April.<ref name=BrownSkye /> The operation was split into four sections, relating to different divisions of the Fourth Army:\n*Skye I; Fourth Army headquarters\n*Skye II; British II Corps\n*Skye III; American XV Corps (a genuine formation, but with fictional units added to its order of battle)\n*Skye IV; British VII Corps.\n\nIn his 2000 book, ''Fortitude: The D-Day Deception Campaign'', [[Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh]], who was a member of [[Ops (B)]], concluded, \"No evidence has so far been found to show that wireless deception or visual misdirection made any contribution to Fortitude North\". It is thought that the Germans were not actually monitoring the radio traffic that was being simulated.<ref>Hesketh, p. 167</ref>\n\n==Fortitude South==\nFortitude South employed similar deception in the south of England, threatening an invasion at Pas de Calais by the fictional 1st U.S. Army Group ([[FUSAG]]). France was the crux of the Bodyguard plan. As the most logical choice for an invasion, the Allied high command had to mislead the German defences in a very small geographical area. The Pas de Calais offered a number of advantages over the chosen invasion site, such as the shortest crossing of the [[English Channel]] and the quickest route into Germany. As a result, the German High Command, particularly [[Erwin Rommel]], took steps to fortify that area of coastline heavily. The Allies decided to amplify that belief of a Calais landing.<ref name=LatimerFortitudeSouth >Latimer 2001, pp. 218\u2013232</ref>\n\nMontgomery, commanding the Allied landing forces, knew that the crucial aspect of any invasion was the ability to enlarge a beachhead into a full front. He also had only 37 divisions at his command, compared to around 60 German formations. Fortitude South's main aims were to give the impression of a much larger invasion force (the FUSAG) in the South-East of England; to achieve tactical surprise in the Normandy landings and, once the invasion had occurred, to mislead the Germans into thinking that it a diversionary tactic, with Calais being the real objective.<ref name=\"LatimerFortitudeSouth\"/>\n\n===Operation Quicksilver===\n{{Main|Operation Quicksilver (WWII)}}\n[[File:1st Army Group.svg|thumb|Symbol of the fictional 1st US Army Group]]\nThe key element of Fortitude South was Operation Quicksilver. It entailed misleading the Germans that the Allied force consisted of two army groups, 21st Army Group under Montgomery (the genuine Normandy invasion force), and 1st US Army Group ([[FUSAG]]) (a fictitious force under General [[George Patton]]), positioned in southeastern England for a crossing at the Pas de Calais.\n\nAt no point were the Germans fed false documents describing the invasion plans. Instead, they were allowed to construct a misleading [[order of battle]] for the Allied forces. To mount a massive invasion of Europe from England, military planners had little choice but to stage units around the country with those that would land first being nearest to the embarkation point. Since FUSAG was placed in the South-East of England, German intelligence was correctly predicted to deduce that the centre of the invasion force was opposite Calais, the point on the French coast that is closest to England and so would be a likely landing point.\n\nTo facilitate the deception, additional buildings were constructed, and dummy aircraft and landing craft were placed around possible embarkation points. Patton paid many of them a visit, along with a photographer. Contrary to popular belief, there was no use of other dummy vehicles, such as inflatable tanks, in large part due to Strangeways's refusal to implement widespread physical deception.<ref name=Holt536/><ref name=Gawne/>\n\nIt is thought that the Army encouraged the idea that the dummies were used to draw attention away from some of the other means of deception, such as double agents.<ref name=Gawne/> In any case, the Allies overestimated the Germans' abilities to conduct [[aerial surveillance]] and so many of the props were never constructed. Patton was photographed while he was visiting the props that were mocked up on regular occasions.\n\nA deception of such a size required input from many organisations, including [[MI5]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] via Ops B, and the armed services. Information from the various deception agencies was organised by and channelled through the London Controlling Section, under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Bevan (British Army officer)|John Bevan]].\n\n==Fortitude South II==\nOn 20 July [[Ops (B)]] took over control of Fortitude South from R Force. Earlier the previous month, they had begun work to follow up the operation.<ref name=Holt584/> The new story centered on the idea that Eisenhower had decided to defeat the Germans through the existing beachhead. As a result, elements of FUSAG had been detached and sent to reinforce Normandy, and a second, smaller, Second American Army Group (SUSAG) would be formed to threaten the Pas de Calais.<ref name=Holt585/>\n\nThe plan met some criticism; firstly, there was opposition to the creation of so many fictional US formations in the face of a known manpower shortage in that country. Secondly, the plan reduced the threat to Pas de Calais and so the Fifteenth Army might be moved to reinforce Normandy. As with its predecessor operation, in late June Strangeways rewrote the operation to ensure that the focus remained on Calais.<ref name=Holt585/> In his version, the Normandy beachhead was not as successful, and Eisenhower had taken elements of FUSAG to reinforce its efforts.\n\nFUSAG would be rebuilt with newly-arrived US formations with the aim of landing in France toward the end of July.<ref name=Holt586/>\n\n==Effect==\nBy 28 September 1944, the Allies had agreed to end the Fortitude deception by moving to operational deceptions in the field under the overall charge of [[Ops (B)]].<ref name=Holt630/>\n\nThe Allies were able to judge how well Fortitude worked because of [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]], the [[signals intelligence]] that was obtained by breaking German codes and ciphers. On June 1, a decrypted transmission by [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], the Japanese ambassador, to his government that recounted a recent conversation with Hitler confirmed the effectiveness of Fortitude. When asked for Hitler's thoughts on the Allied battle plan, he had said, \"I think that diversionary actions will take place in a number of places - against Norway, Denmark, the southern part of western France, and the French Mediterranean coast\",<ref name=HoltUltra>Holt 2004, pp. 565\u2013566</ref> and he added that he expected the Allies would then attack in force across the [[Straits of Dover]].<ref name=HoltUltra/>\n\nThe Allies maintained the pretense of FUSAG and other forces threatening Pas-de-Calais for some considerable time after D-Day, possibly even as late as September 1944. That was vital to the success of the Allied plan by forcing the Germans to keep most of their reserves bottled up in wait for an attack on Calais that never came. That allowed the Allies to maintain and to build upon their marginal foothold in Normandy.\n\nDuring the course of Fortitude, the almost-complete lack of German aerial reconnaissance, together with the absence of uncontrolled German agents in Britain, came to make physical deception almost irrelevant. The unreliability of \"diplomatic leaks\" resulted in their discontinuance. Most deception was carried out by means of false wireless traffic and through German double agents. The latter proved to be far more significant.\n\n==Reasons for success==\nThe operation was successful for several reasons:\n* The long term view taken by British Intelligence to cultivate double agents as channels of [[disinformation]] to the enemy.\n* The use of [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] decrypts of machine-encrypted messages between the [[Abwehr]] and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]], which quickly indicated the effectiveness of deception tactics. That is one of the early uses of a [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop]] deception system. The messages were usually encrypted by [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]], rather than [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] machines.\n* [[Reginald Victor Jones]], the Assistant Director Intelligence (Science) at the British [[Air Ministry]], insisted that for reasons of tactical deception, for every radar station attacked within the real invasion area, two were to be attacked outside it.\n* The extensive nature of the German intelligence machinery and the rivalry among the various elements.\n* [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Patton]] was the leader whom the Germans feared the most and whom they considered him the Allies' best general.<ref name=Beevor571/> Therefore, the German High Command believed that he would lead the daring attack.\n\n==In fiction==\n*''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' is a [[1978 in literature|1978]] novel by [[Ken Follett]] about a Nazi spy stationed in the south of England who discovers the Allied deception and races to inform the German leadership.

Fortitude was divided into two sub-plans, North and South, with the aim of misleading the German high command as to the location of the invasion.\n\nBoth Fortitude plans involved the creation of phantom [[field armies]] (based in [[Edinburgh]] and the south of England) which threatened [[Norway]] ([[Fortitude North]]) and [[Pas de Calais]] ([[Fortitude South]]). The operation was intended to divert Axis attention away from Normandy and, after the invasion on 6 June 1944, to delay reinforcement by convincing the Germans that the landings were purely a diversionary attack.\n\n==Background==\nFortitude was one of the major elements of [[Operation Bodyguard]], the overall Allied deception stratagem for the Normandy landings. Bodyguard's main objective was to ensure the Germans would not increase troop presence in Normandy and to do so by promoting the appearance that the Allied forces would attack in other locations.\n\nAfter the 6 June 1944 invasion, the plan was to delay movement of German reserves to the Normandy beachhead and to prevent a potentially-disastrous counterattack. Fortitude's objectives were to promote alternative targets of Norway and Calais.<ref name=Jablonsky>Jablonsky 1991</ref><ref name=BrownPrologue>Brown 1975, pp. 1\u201310</ref>\n\nThe planning of Operation Fortitude came under the auspices of the [[London Controlling Section]] (LCS), a secret body that was set up to manage Allied deception strategy during the war. However, the execution of each plan fell to the various [[theater (warfare)|theatre]] commanders; in the case of Fortitude, it was [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) under General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. A special section, [[Ops (B)]], was established at SHAEF to handle the operation and all of the theatre's deception warfare. The LCS retained responsibility for what was called \"special means\", the use of diplomatic channels and double agents.<ref name=BrownPrologue/>\n\nFortitude was split into two parts, North and South, both with similar aims. Fortitude North was intended to convince the [[German High Command]] that the Allies, staging out of Scotland, would attempt an invasion of [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]]. Fortitude South employed the same tactic, with the apparent objective being [[Pas de Calais]].<ref name=Jablonsky/>\n\n==Planning==\nPlanning was ostensibly the responsibility of [[Noel Wild]] and his Ops (B) staff. However, in practice, the work was shared between Wild and the heads of the LCS and B1a. Work began in December 1943, at first under the codename Mespot. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] judged that to be unsuitable and so the Fortitude name was adopted on February 18.<ref group=note>SHAEF was offered a list of names to choose from; Bulldog, Axehead, Swordhilt, Fortitude and Ignite</ref><ref name=Levine202/>\n\n===Fortitude South===\nWild's first version of the Fortitude South plan was produced in early January 1943 and aimed to counter the likelihood that the Germans would notice invasion preparations in the southern England.<ref name=Holt531/> The intention was to create the impression that an invasion was aimed at the Pas-de-Calais sometime in mid-July. Once the real invasion had landed, six fictional divisions would keep the threat to Calais alive.<ref name=Levine203/> The Fortitude South plan would be implemented, at an operational level, by the invasion force, the [[21st Army Group]] under the command of General [[Bernard Montgomery]].<ref name=Levine202/>\n\nThat presented a problem in the form of Colonel [[David Strangeways]], head of Montgomery's [[R Force]] deception staff.<ref name=Levine202/> Strangeways had, in the opinion of Ops(B)'s Christopher Harmer, the same arrogance as his commanding officer. More importantly, he held a low opinion of the London establishment of the \"old boys'\" clubs of Ops (B) and LCS. Dissatisfied with the Fortitude South outline, he, in the words of Harmer, set out to ride \"roughshod over the established deception organization\".<ref name=Levine203/> Strangeways's criticisms highlighted that the plan aimed to cover the Allies' real intentions, rather than to create a realistic threat to Calais.{{elucidate|date=February 2015}}<ref name=Levine203/><ref name=Holt532/> That was not the only issue, and Strangeways was not the only one to notice them.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} If the Germans were able to judge the Allied state of readiness in southwestern England, they would be expecting an invasion in early June,{{why|date=February 2015}} which left several weeks to defeat any bridgehead and tot,urn to the defence of Calais.<ref name=Holt532/>\n\n[[File:DecoyLCT.jpg|thumb|Dummy landing craft]]\nOn 25 Januato Montgomery's Chief of Staff, [[Freddie de Guingand|Francis de Guingand]], sent a letter to the deception planners that included asking them to focus on Pas-de-Calais as the main assault; it was almost certainly sent at the behest of Strangeways.<ref name=Holt533/> With those criticisms in hand, Wild produced his final draft for Fortitude South. In the revised plan, issued on 30 January and approved by the Allied chiefs on 18 February, fifty divisions would be positioned in Southern England to attack Pas de Calais.<ref name=Levine203/><ref name=Holt533/> After the real invasion had landed, the story would change, suggesting to the Germans that several assault divisions remained in England that were ready to conduct a cross-channel attack once the Normandy beachhead had drawn German defences away from Calais. The plan still retained some of its earlier form, most notably since the first part of the story still aimed to suggest an invasion date of mid-July.<ref name=Holt534/> \n\nStrangeways was still unimpressed. He pointed out that convincing the Germans of so many fictional divisions would be tough and that even That would be easier than convincing them of Montgomery's ability to manage two entire invasions at the same time.<ref name=Levine205/> Wild's plan outlined ten divisions for the Calais assault, six of them fictional and the remainder being the real American V Corps and British I Corps. However, the corps would be part of the actual Normandy invasion and so it would be difficult to imply Calais being the main assault after D-Day.<ref name=Holt535/> Strangeways's final concerns related to the effort required for physical deception, as the plan called for large numbers of troop movements and dummy craft.<ref name=Levine205/>\n{{quotebox\n|quote  = I rewrote it entirely. It was too complicated, and the people who made it had not never done it before. Now they did their best - but it didn't suit the operation that Monty was considering.... You see so much depended on the success of that deception plan.\n|source = Strangeways, writing in 1996<ref name=Levine208/>\n|width  = 33%\n|align = right}}\n\nStrangeways's objections were so strong that he refused to undertake most of the physical deception. A power struggle ensued throughout February and early March, between Ops(B) and Strangeways as to who had authority to implement each part of the deception plan.  Montgomery put his full support behind his head of deception and so Strangeways prevailed.<ref name=Holt536/><ref name=Levine206/> Finally, in a 23 February meeting between R Force and Ops(B), Strangeways tore up a copy of the plan, decreeing it useless, and announced that he would rewrite it from scratch.<ref name=Levine205/>\n\n[[File:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|A dummy [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] tank]]\nThe established deceivers were dubious about Strangeways's announcement and assumed he would resubmit the existing plan with some modifications.<ref name=Levine206/> However, he duly submitted a rewritten operation that was met, in Harmer's words, with \"astonishment\".<ref name=Levine208/>\n\nStrangeways's revised Fortitude South invented an entire new field army. The [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG), commanded by Lt. Gen. George Patton, was a skeleton formation formed for administrative purposes but never used. However, the Germans had discovered its existence through radio intercepts. Strangeways proposed activating the unit, with a series of fictional and real formations, to overcome the problem of Montgomery handling two invasions.<ref name=Levine206/> Moreover, he proposed that FUSAG should represent the main Allied threat to the Germans, which they would expect to land around Calais. Once [[Operation Neptune]]'s landings had taken place, that should be passed off as a diversion to distract German defences from the main attack by FUSAG.<ref name=Levine207/>\n\nThe new Fortitude South came with six subsidiary plans, Quicksilver I-VI, with specific implementation details.<ref name=Levine207/>\n\n==Special means==\n[[File:Dummy aircraft - Oct. 1943.jpg|thumb|A dummy aircraft, modelled after the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]], October 1943]]\nFor deceptions, the Allies had developed a number of methodologies, which were referred to as \"special means\". They included combinations of physical deception, fake wireless activity, leaks through diplomatic channels and double agents. Fortitude used all of those techniques to various extents. For example, Fortitude North relied heavily on wireless transmission (the Allies thought that Scotland was too far for German reconnaissance to reach), and Fortitude South used the Allies' network of double agents.\n\n#Physical deception: to mislead the enemy with nonexistent units by fake infrastructure and equipment, such as dummy landing craft, dummy airfields and decoy lighting.\n#Controlled leaks: information would pass through diplomatic channels, which might be passed on via neutral countries to the Germans.\n#Wireless traffic: wireless traffic was created to simulate actual units to mislead the enemy.\n#Using German agents controlled by the Allies through the [[Double Cross System]] to send false information to the German intelligence services.\n#Public presence of notable staff associated with phantom groups such as FUSAG, most notably the well-known US General [[George Patton]].\n\n===Double agents===\nOne of the main deception channels for the Allies was the use of double agents. B1A, the Counter-Intelligence Division of [[MI5]], had done a good job in intercepting all of the German agents in Britain. Many of them were recruited as double agents under the [[Double Cross System]]. These were the three most important double agents during the Fortitude operation:\n*[[Juan Pujol Garc\u00eda]] (Garbo), a Spanish citizen who managed to get recruited by German intelligence, sent them abundant but convincing disinformation from Lisbon until the Allies accepted his offer, and he was employed by the British. He had created a network of 27 imaginary sub-agents by the time of Fortitude, and the Germans unwittingly paid the British Exchequer large amounts of money regularly, thinking they were funding a network that was loyal to themselves. He was awarded both the [[Iron Cross]] by the Germans and an [[MBE]] by the British after [[D-Day]].\n*[[Roman Czerniawski]] (Brutus), a Polish officer who ran an intelligence network for the Allies in occupied France. Captured by the Germans, he was offered a chance to work for them as a spy. On his arrival in Britain, he turned himself in to British intelligence.\n*[[Du\u0161an Popov]] (Tricycle), a Yugoslav lawyer, whose flamboyant lifestyle covered his intelligence activities.\n\n==Fortitude North==\n[[File:EdinburghCastle.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh Castle]], the headquarters of the fictional British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] during Operation Fortitude]]\nFortitude North was designed to mislead the Germans into expecting an invasion of [[Norway]]. By threatening any weakened Norwegian defence, the Allies hoped to prevent or to delay reinforcement of France after the Normandy invasion. The plan involved simulating a buildup of forces in northern England and political contact with Sweden.<ref name=Sexton>Sexton 1983, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring a similar operation in 1943, [[Operation Cockade]], a fictional field army ([[British Fourth Army#Second World War|British Fourth Army]]) had been created, headquartered in [[Edinburgh Castle]].<ref name=HoltTindall>Holt 2004, p. 486</ref> It was decided to continue to use the same force during Fortitude. Unlike its southern counterpart, the deception relied primarily on \"Special Means\" and fake radio traffic since it was judged unlikely that German reconnaissance planes could reach Scotland unintercepted.<ref name=Sexton/><ref name=\"BrownSkye\">Cave Brown 1975</ref> False information about the arrival of troops in the area was reported by double agents [[Mutt and Jeff (spies)|Mutt and Jeff]], who had surrendered following their 1941 landing in the [[Moray Firth]], and the British media co-operated by broadcasting fake information, such as football scores or wedding announcements, to nonexistent troops.<ref name=BrownSkye>Cave Brown 1975</ref>{{rp|464\u2013466}} Fortitude North was so successful that by late spring 1944, Hitler had thirteen army divisions in Norway.<ref>Ambrose, Stephen, D-Day June 6th, 1944 (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994)  p. 82</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1944, British commandos attacked targets in Norway to simulate preparations for invasion. They destroyed industrial targets, such as shipping and power infrastructure, as well as military outposts. That coincided with an increase in naval activity in the northern seas and in political pressure on neutral Sweden.<ref name=BrownSkye/>{{rp|466\u2013467}}\n\n===Operation Skye===\nOperation Skye was the codename for the radio deception component of Fortitude North, involving simulated radio traffic between fictional army units. The programme began on 22 March 1944, overseen by Colonel R. M. McLeod, and became fully operational by 6 April.<ref name=BrownSkye /> The operation was split into four sections, relating to different divisions of the Fourth Army:\n*Skye I; Fourth Army headquarters\n*Skye II; British II Corps\n*Skye III; American XV Corps (a genuine formation, but with fictional units added to its order of battle)\n*Skye IV; British VII Corps.\n\nIn his 2000 book, ''Fortitude: The D-Day Deception Campaign'', [[Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh]], who was a member of [[Ops (B)]], concluded, \"No evidence has so far been found to show that wireless deception or visual misdirection made any contribution to Fortitude North\". It is thought that the Germans were not actually monitoring the radio traffic that was being simulated.<ref>Hesketh, p. 167</ref>\n\n==Fortitude South==\nFortitude South employed similar deception in the south of England, threatening an invasion at Pas de Calais by the fictional 1st U.S. Army Group ([[FUSAG]]). France was the crux of the Bodyguard plan. As the most logical choice for an invasion, the Allied high command had to mislead the German defences in a very small geographical area. The Pas de Calais offered a number of advantages over the chosen invasion site, such as the shortest crossing of the [[English Channel]] and the quickest route into Germany. As a result, the German High Command, particularly [[Erwin Rommel]], took steps to fortify that area of coastline heavily. The Allies decided to amplify that belief of a Calais landing.<ref name=LatimerFortitudeSouth >Latimer 2001, pp. 218\u2013232</ref>\n\nMontgomery, commanding the Allied landing forces, knew that the crucial aspect of any invasion was the ability to enlarge a beachhead into a full front. He also had only 37 divisions at his command, compared to around 60 German formations. Fortitude South's main aims were to give the impression of a much larger invasion force (the FUSAG) in the South-East of England; to achieve tactical surprise in the Normandy landings and, once the invasion had occurred, to mislead the Germans into thinking that it a diversionary tactic, with Calais being the real objective.<ref name=\"LatimerFortitudeSouth\"/>\n\n===Operation Quicksilver===\n{{Main|Operation Quicksilver (WWII)}}\n[[File:1st Army Group.svg|thumb|Symbol of the fictional 1st US Army Group]]\nThe key element of Fortitude South was Operation Quicksilver. It entailed misleading the Germans that the Allied force consisted of two army groups, 21st Army Group under Montgomery (the genuine Normandy invasion force), and 1st US Army Group ([[FUSAG]]) (a fictitious force under General [[George Patton]]), positioned in southeastern England for a crossing at the Pas de Calais.\n\nAt no point were the Germans fed false documents describing the invasion plans. Instead, they were allowed to construct a misleading [[order of battle]] for the Allied forces. To mount a massive invasion of Europe from England, military planners had little choice but to stage units around the country with those that would land first being nearest to the embarkation point. Since FUSAG was placed in the South-East of England, German intelligence was correctly predicted to deduce that the centre of the invasion force was opposite Calais, the point on the French coast that is closest to England and so would be a likely landing point.\n\nTo facilitate the deception, additional buildings were constructed, and dummy aircraft and landing craft were placed around possible embarkation points. Patton paid many of them a visit, along with a photographer. Contrary to popular belief, there was no use of other dummy vehicles, such as inflatable tanks, in large part due to Strangeways's refusal to implement widespread physical deception.<ref name=Holt536/><ref name=Gawne/>\n\nIt is thought that the Army encouraged the idea that the dummies were used to draw attention away from some of the other means of deception, such as double agents.<ref name=Gawne/> In any case, the Allies overestimated the Germans' abilities to conduct [[aerial surveillance]] and so many of the props were never constructed. Patton was photographed while he was visiting the props that were mocked up on regular occasions.\n\nA deception of such a size required input from many organisations, including [[MI5]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] via Ops B, and the armed services. Information from the various deception agencies was organised by and channelled through the London Controlling Section, under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Bevan (British Army officer)|John Bevan]].\n\n==Fortitude South II==\nOn 20 July [[Ops (B)]] took over control of Fortitude South from R Force. Earlier the previous month, they had begun work to follow up the operation.<ref name=Holt584/> The new story centered on the idea that Eisenhower had decided to defeat the Germans through the existing beachhead. As a result, elements of FUSAG had been detached and sent to reinforce Normandy, and a second, smaller, Second American Army Group (SUSAG) would be formed to threaten the Pas de Calais.<ref name=Holt585/>\n\nThe plan met some criticism; firstly, there was opposition to the creation of so many fictional US formations in the face of a known manpower shortage in that country. Secondly, the plan reduced the threat to Pas de Calais and so the Fifteenth Army might be moved to reinforce Normandy. As with its predecessor operation, in late June Strangeways rewrote the operation to ensure that the focus remained on Calais.<ref name=Holt585/> In his version, the Normandy beachhead was not as successful, and Eisenhower had taken elements of FUSAG to reinforce its efforts.\n\nFUSAG would be rebuilt with newly-arrived US formations with the aim of landing in France toward the end of July.<ref name=Holt586/>\n\n==Effect==\nBy 28 September 1944, the Allies had agreed to end the Fortitude deception by moving to operational deceptions in the field under the overall charge of [[Ops (B)]].<ref name=Holt630/>\n\nThe Allies were able to judge how well Fortitude worked because of [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]], the [[signals intelligence]] that was obtained by breaking German codes and ciphers. On June 1, a decrypted transmission by [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], the Japanese ambassador, to his government that recounted a recent conversation with Hitler confirmed the effectiveness of Fortitude. When asked for Hitler's thoughts on the Allied battle plan, he had said, \"I think that diversionary actions will take place in a number of places - against Norway, Denmark, the southern part of western France, and the French Mediterranean coast\",<ref name=HoltUltra>Holt 2004, pp. 565\u2013566</ref> and he added that he expected the Allies would then attack in force across the [[Straits of Dover]].<ref name=HoltUltra/>\n\nThe Allies maintained the pretense of FUSAG and other forces threatening Pas-de-Calais for some considerable time after D-Day, possibly even as late as September 1944. That was vital to the success of the Allied plan by forcing the Germans to keep most of their reserves bottled up in wait for an attack on Calais that never came. That allowed the Allies to maintain and to build upon their marginal foothold in Normandy.\n\nDuring the course of Fortitude, the almost-complete lack of German aerial reconnaissance, together with the absence of uncontrolled German agents in Britain, came to make physical deception almost irrelevant. The unreliability of \"diplomatic leaks\" resulted in their discontinuance. Most deception was carried out by means of false wireless traffic and through German double agents. The latter proved to be far more significant.\n\n==Reasons for success==\nThe operation was successful for several reasons:\n* The long term view taken by British Intelligence to cultivate double agents as channels of [[disinformation]] to the enemy.\n* The use of [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] decrypts of machine-encrypted messages between the [[Abwehr]] and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]], which quickly indicated the effectiveness of deception tactics. That is one of the early uses of a [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop]] deception system. The messages were usually encrypted by [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]], rather than [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] machines.\n* [[Reginald Victor Jones]], the Assistant Director Intelligence (Science) at the British [[Air Ministry]], insisted that for reasons of tactical deception, for every radar station attacked within the real invasion area, two were to be attacked outside it.\n* The extensive nature of the German intelligence machinery and the rivalry among the various elements.\n* [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Patton]] was the leader whom the Germans feared the most and whom they considered him the Allies' best general.<ref name=Beevor571/> Therefore, the German High Command believed that he would lead the daring attack.\n\n==In fiction==\n*''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' is a [[1978 in literature|1978]] novel by [[Ken Follett]] about a Nazi spy stationed in the south of England who discovers the Allied deception and races to inform the German leadership.

In two episodes of [[List of Goodnight Sweetheart episodes#Series 5|Series 5]], Gary, when he returns to 1944, appears to be the double of one of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s aides. He is used in that guise by MI5 and is sent to Calais; he makes contact with the [[French Resistance]] but is captured by the [[Gestapo]]. All of that was planned to reinforce the Pas-de-Calais invasion deception. Luckily, Gary is able to escape and to return to England.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- Beevor -->\n<ref name=Beevor571>Beevor (2012), p. 571</ref>\n<!-- Holt -->\n<ref name=Holt531>Holt (2004), p. 531</ref>\n<ref name=Holt532>Holt (2004), p. 532</ref>\n<ref name=Holt533>Holt (2004), p. 533</ref>\n<ref name=Holt534>Holt (2004), p. 534</ref>\n<ref name=Holt535>Holt (2004), p. 535</ref>\n<ref name=Holt536>Holt (2004), pp. 536\u201337</ref>\n<ref name=Holt584>Holt (2004), p. 584</ref>\n<ref name=Holt585>Holt (2004), p. 585</ref>\n<ref name=Holt586>Holt (2004), p. 586</ref>\n<ref name=Holt630>Holt (2004), p. 630</ref>\n<!-- Levine -->\n<ref name=Levine202>Levine (2011), p. 202</ref>\n<ref name=Levine203>Levine (2011), pp. 203\u2013204</ref>\n<ref name=Levine205>Levine (2011), pp. 205\u2013206</ref>\n<ref name=Levine206>Levine (2011), p. 206</ref>\n<ref name=Levine207>Levine (2011), p. 207</ref>\n<ref name=Levine208>Levine (2011), p. 208</ref>\n<!-- Gawne -->\n<ref name=Gawne>Gawne (2002), p.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Cite book | last = Cave Brown | first = Anthony | author-link = Anthony Cave Brown | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day | publisher = Harpercollins  | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0060105518 }}\n*{{Cite book | last = Beevor | first = Antony | author-link = Antony Beevor | title = The Second World War | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0297844976 }}\n*Delmer, Sefton, ''The Counterfeit Spy'' (Hutchinson, London, 1972)\n*Gawne, Jonathan, ''Ghosts of the ETO'' (American Tactical Deception Units in the European Theater, 1944\u20131945)(Casemate Publishing, Havertown, PA, 2002)\n*Howard, Sir Michael, ''Strategic Deception'' (British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume 5) (Cambridge University Press, New York, 1990)\n*Holt, Thaddeus, ''The Deceivers: Allied Military Deception in the Second World War'' (Scribner, New York, 2004)\n*Harris, Tomas, ''GARBO, The Spy Who Saved D-Day'', Richmond, Surrey, England: Public Record Office, 2000, {{ISBN|1-873162-81-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Hesketh|first=Roger|title=Fortitude: The D-Day Deception Campaign|publisher=The Overlook Press|year=2000|location=[[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock, NY]]|isbn=1-58567-075-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fortitudeddaydec00hesk}}\n*Latimer, Jon, ''Deception in War'', Overlook Press, New York, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-58567-381-0}}\n*Levine, Joshua, ''Operation Fortitude: the Story of the Spy Operation that Saved D-Day'', London: Collins, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-00-731353-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Leo|title=Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's War 1941\u20131945|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1998|location=London|isbn=0-00-653063-X}}\n*{{cite journal|title = Phantoms of the North: British Deceptions in Scandinavia, 1941\u20131944|author =Sexton, Donal J.|journal = Military Affairs|volume = 47|number = 3|pages =109\u2013114|ISSN = 0026-3931|year = 1983|publisher = Society for Military Histor|doi=10.2307/1988080}}\n\n\n{{Battle of Normandy}}\n{{Allied Military Deception in World War II}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fortitude}}\n[[Category:World War II deception operations]]\n[[Category:Operation Overlord]]\n[[Category:Operation Fortitude| ]]\n", "name_user": "142.0.99.209", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBackground)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude"}

There is a difference in the brain development of explicit and [[implicit memory]] in infants. Implicit memory is controlled by an early-developing memory system in the brain that is present very early on, and can be explained by the early maturation of [[striatum]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brain stem]], which are all involved in implicit learning and memory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=D. |last2=Moscovitch |first2=M. |year=1984 |chapter=Infants, amnesiacs, and dissociable memory |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Moscovitch |title=Infant Memory |pages=173\u2013209 |location=New York |publisher=Plenum }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of explicit memory depends on a later developing memory system in the brain that reaches maturity between 8 and 10 months of age. Explicit memory depends heavily on structures in the [[medial temporal lobe]], including the [[hippocampus]] and the [[parahippocampal cortex]].

First is the central [[Executive (management)|executive]] which is responsible for a range of regulatory functions including attention, the control of action, and problem solving. Second, the [[phonological loop]], which is specialized for the manipulation and retention of material in particular informational domains. Finally, the visuospatial sketchpad stores material in terms of its visual or spatial features. The strength of the relationships between the three components of working memory vary; the central executive is strongly linked with both the phonological loop as well as the visuospatial sketchpad which are both independent of each other.

Prior to about 7 years of age, serial recall performance is mediated by the [[phonological]] store which is one of two components of the phonological loop. Preschool aged children do not use a subvocal rehearsal strategy to maintain decaying phonological representations in the store but instead they identify visual features of pictures in order to remember them. This is evident first by watching children for overt sign of rehearsal (for example lip movement) and second if the child is given nameable pictures, there are no differences in retrieval found for long versus short words. At the age of seven, children begin to use a subvocal rehearsal process to maximize retention in the phonological store. As development continues, nonauditory memory material is recoded into a phonological code suitable for the phonological loop when possible.<ref name=\"gather\" />\n\n===Visuospatial Sketchpad===\nYounger children (under the age of 5) may be more dependent than older children or adults on using the visuospatial sketchpad to support immediate memory for visual material. Older children adopt a strategy of verbally recoding pictures where possible and also use the phonological loop to mediate performance of the \u201cvisual\u201d memory task. Between the ages of 5 and 11, visual [[memory span]] increases substantially and it is at this point when adult levels of performance are reached.<ref name=\"gather\" /><ref name=\"DOI 10.1075/ce.4.2.02jos\"/><ref name=pmid17654279/>\n\n==Long Term Memory==\nLong term memory, also known as episodic and semantic memory, has the ability to store valuable information for a proficient amount of time.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\">{{Cite book|title=The Gale encyclopedia of psychology|others=Longe, Jacqueline L.|year = 2016|isbn=978-1-4103-1781-0|edition=Third|location=Farmington Hills, MI|oclc=941831058}}</ref> According to Longe (2016) the storage of long-term memory could be in assortments of minutes to lifetime, meaning an activity or event attended can be recalled after a few minutes or be stored for a long time.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/> Long term memory uses a very important distinguishing factor known as meaning that can help an individual learn: It is used in a form of encoding and it is deemed the primary method of developing long-term memory.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/> Once meaning is understood and applied to information it can impact what one recalls.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/>\n\nExplicit memory becomes much better over the developmental years. However, there are small effects of age on implicit memory, which could be because implicit memory involves more basic processes than declarative memory which would make it less affected by a child's developing cognitive skills and abilities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Emma V.|last2=Berry|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Shanks|first3=David R.|date=2013|title=Age effects on explicit and implicit memory|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00639|pmid=24065942|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>\n\n===Infants===\nIt has been recorded from numerous studies that infants with the early age of 2 to 3 months can in develop a memory from certain experiences.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> A surprising finding was that within the same age group of 2 to 3 months, infants could also remember an event or memory that was forgotten over the years.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The infant experienced this recollection by  accosting a certain factor that might have sparked that forgotten memory.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> These impressive findings were found by testing the kicking of infants. According to Robert & Saweikis (2004), researchers placed a mobile over the infant\u2019s crib and a ribbon that connects the infant\u2019s leg to the mobile.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The infants demonstrated to the researchers that they were learning the connection between their kicking and the mobile\u2019s movement.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> Once the allotted time passed, the infant\u2019s leg was attached once more to the mobile.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> Two types of ideas were formed; supposing that the child could energetically start kicking, would lead to the assumption that the infant remembered the connection between the mobile\u2019s movement and the childs kicking. Now, if the infant\u2019s kicking gingerly become more energetic, that would presume that the infant is relearning the connection, which would suggest that the infant has forgotten the connection made.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/>\n\nThe study also indicated that the infant could remember the connection for up to 14 days.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> However, once certain time has passed the infant\u2019s leg is once again connected to the mobile\u2019s movement with a ribbon to test of the infant recalled what to do.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The infant did not remember what to do, and they were introduced to a certain factor that would aid the infant to remember.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> According to Robert & Saweikis (2004), If the \u201cexperimenter\u201d moves the mobile showing the infant the movements, as soon as the infant is reconnected to the mobile with a ribbon, the infant will start kicking energetically.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The conclusion was that the infant could indeed remember a memory, although time has passed.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/>\n\nInfants who are 5 months or older are able to use emotions to influence their memories. However, at this age, infants will be more likely to remember things that were characterized by positive emotions. Numerous mechanisms that are used to study and infer memory in children cannot be used on infants, due to the process the study is retrieved, which include writing or speaking.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later. The follow-up tests shown to the infants included two geometric shapes: one from the original test, and a new shape. The researchers were able to record how long the infants looked at the images in the follow-up tests and measured how long the infants stared at each shape. The infants were more likely to gaze at the geometric shapes from the original tests if they had been paired with positive voices than if they had been paired with neutral or negative voices. This study indicated that infants at this age would be able to better remember shapes and patterns of things if they were associated with positive emotions because positivity would increase the infants' interest and attention.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flom |first1=Ross |last2=Janis |first2=Rebecca B. |last3=Garcia |first3=Darren J. |last4=Kirwan |first4=C.

Better retention was shown with information that had greater cohesion and more elaborative elements. Familiarity and repetition of an experience can also influence the organization of information in storage for preschoolers and older children.<ref name=\"fivush\" /> Children who experienced an event twice recalled the event better 3 months later than did children who only experienced it once and showed equally good recall at 3 months compared to recall at 2 weeks after experiences.<ref name=\"swrtc.nmsu.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://swrtc.nmsu.edu/cli-2/pastconferences/2017-2/agenda/childtraumatic/|title=Child Traumatic Memory and the Testimony of Children {{!}} Southwest Regional Training Center {{!}} New Mexico State University|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===School Age Children===\nAge differences in memory are attributed to age-correlated growth in the foundation of knowledge.

Memories formed at this age and beyond are more likely to stand the test of time over the years and be recalled in adulthood, compared to earlier memories. Young children can sometimes retain information from specific episodes over very long periods of time, but the particular information a child of a particular age is likely to retain over different periods of time is unpredictable. This depends on the nature of the memory event and individual differences in the child such as gender, parental style of communication, and language ability.<ref name=\"fivush\">{{cite journal |last1=Fivush |first1=Robyn |last2=Gray |first2=Jacquelyn T. |last3=Fromhoff |first3=Fayne A. |title=Two-year-old talk about the past |journal=Cognitive Development |volume=2 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=393\u2013409 |doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(87)80015-1 }}</ref>\n\nOne of the most important aspects of episodic memory according to Tulving (1985, 1999) is the element of the individual to cognitively travel to both the past and the future.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons Ltd\">{{Cite book|title=The Wiley Handbook on the Development of Children's Memory: Bauer/The Wiley|date=2013-10-07|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd|isbn=978-1-118-59770-5|editor-last=Bauer|editor-first=Patricia J.|location=Chichester, UK|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118597705|editor-last2=Fivush|editor-first2=Robyn}}</ref> A studied yet still speculative thought about episodic memory in children is the lack of foresight episodic.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons Ltd\"/> This suggests that children are more susceptible and successful in remembering certain events (eg., what are you going to have for lunch, what will you play with in the park, etc.), not because they traveled in both past and future, but that parents are the ones\u2019 who generally organize the day, meaning they are the ones who have control over their futures.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons Ltd\"/>\n\n==Autobiographical Memory==\nThe amount of information that is able to be recalled depends on the child\u2019s age at the time of the event.

Prior to about 7 years of age, serial recall performance is mediated by the [[phonological]] store which is one of two components of the phonological loop. Preschool aged children do not use a subvocal rehearsal strategy to maintain decaying phonological representations in the store but instead they identify visual features of pictures in order to remember them. This is evident first by watching children for overt sign of rehearsal (for example lip movement) and second if the child is given nameable pictures, there are no differences in retrieval found for long versus short words. At the age of seven, children begin to use a subvocal rehearsal process to maximize retention in the phonological store.

According to Robert & Saweikis (2004), researchers placed a mobile over the infant\u2019s crib and a ribbon that connects the infant\u2019s leg to the mobile.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The infants demonstrated to the researchers that they were learning the connection between their kicking and the mobile\u2019s movement.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> Once the allotted time passed, the infant\u2019s leg was attached once more to the mobile.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> Two types of ideas were formed; supposing that the child could energetically start kicking, would lead to the assumption that the infant remembered the connection between the mobile\u2019s movement and the childs kicking.

However, at this age, infants will be more likely to remember things that were characterized by positive emotions. Numerous mechanisms that are used to study and infer memory in children cannot be used on infants, due to the process the study is retrieved, which include writing or speaking.<ref name=\"Learning & memory\"/> The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later. The follow-up tests shown to the infants included two geometric shapes: one from the original test, and a new shape. The researchers were able to record how long the infants looked at the images in the follow-up tests and measured how long the infants stared at each shape. The infants were more likely to gaze at the geometric shapes from the original tests if they had been paired with positive voices than if they had been paired with neutral or negative voices. This study indicated that infants at this age would be able to better remember shapes and patterns of things if they were associated with positive emotions because positivity would increase the infants' interest and attention.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flom |first1=Ross |last2=Janis |first2=Rebecca B. |last3=Garcia |first3=Darren J. |last4=Kirwan |first4=C.

They also prefer to use memory strategies such as [[categorization]] rather than simple rehearsal, looking or naming and use these strategies without needing to think about memory strategies prior to learning.<ref name=\"justice\" />\n\nConsequently, it is crucial to acknowledge that a child\u2019s brain is constantly experiencing development from life adaptation.<ref name=\"Damon 2005 15\u201319\">{{Cite journal|last=Damon|first=William|date=2005|title=Looking back, for a change: A story of directions in child and adolescent development|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=2005|issue=109|pages=15\u201319|doi=10.1002/cd.133|pmid=16342889|issn=1520-3247}}</ref> Children need to be an environment that fortifies and encourages a cognitive development at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|last=UNCTAD-ICTSD|date=2005-04-07|title=Resource Book on TRIPS and Development|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511511363|isbn=9780521850445}}</ref> However, in proportion too literature a child\u2019s mind is a remarkable mechanism that if a child has not been adequately given the optimal care and stimulation for brain development.<ref name=\"Damon 2005 15\u201319\"/> A child can inverse the damage sustained in their early life and have an opportunity to develop.<ref name=\"Damon 2005 15\u201319\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{memory}}\n\n[[Category:Memory]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed +", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_development"}

Wead reported to Pensacola and was billeted in a two-man room with Lieutenant (j.g.) Ralph Eugene Davison, a classmate at the Naval Academy. Wead was assigned to a training flight team with two other officers and former classmates, Lieutenants (j.g.) Robert Morse Farrar and Calvin T. Durgin. In addition to basic and advanced flight and navigation, the students were trained on a catapult installed on a floating barge at Pensacola. Wead was designated a [[United States Naval Aviator]] on 17 April 1920; his wife, Minnie \"Min\" Wead, pinned his golden wings to his uniform.

Additionally, Wead took part in tests involving dummy torpedoes dropped from F-5-L aircraft. Also, in accordance with an Act of Congress, [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin Denby]] issued orders for the establishment of a [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] to begin operations, 1 September 1921, with Rear Admiral [[William A.

Wead was preparing his squadron for the June 1926 tactical exercises aboard {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} up to his accident on 14 April 1926. Wildenberg identified Wead's replacement as Lieutenant Commander Frank Dechant Wagner, USN, who would further improve upon the training tactics devised by Wead, including developing new dive-bombing techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Medical retirement===\nOn 14 April 1926, Wead heard his daughter Marjorie crying. Rushing to her, he accidentally tripped, falling head first down a dark stairway, and fractured his neck. The injury resulted in paralysis. Wead was immediately taken to the U.S. Naval Hospital, Balboa Park (today's [[Naval Medical Center San Diego]]) where the Commandant of the U.S. Naval Hospital, Captain Raymond Spear, was briefed on Wead's condition and ordered for him to be operated on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAccording to an article written by a ''San Diego Union'' staff writer:\n\n{{quote|text=\"''Lieut.

Wead reported to Pensacola and was billeted in a two-man room with Lieutenant (j.g.) Ralph Eugene Davison, a classmate at the Naval Academy. Wead was assigned to a training flight team with two other officers and former classmates, Lieutenants (j.g.) Robert Morse Farrar and Calvin T. Durgin. In addition to basic and advanced flight and navigation, the students were trained on a catapult installed on a floating barge at Pensacola.

Additionally, Wead took part in tests involving dummy torpedoes dropped from F-5-L aircraft. Also, in accordance with an Act of Congress, [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin Denby]] issued orders for the establishment of a [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] to begin operations, 1 September 1921, with Rear Admiral [[William A.

The aviator had just moved into the home and was unfamiliar with the staircase. Physicians, following the operation yesterday, said that Wead will recover but it is doubtful if he will be able to fly again. Wead's outstanding exploit since entering the naval flying corps was his flight against British pilots in the international seaplane races off the Isle of Wight in 1923, when American naval fliers took all the honors.\"''<ref>''The San Diego Union''. \"Daring Aviator Fractures Neck\" (Friday morning edition), 16 April 1926, Editorial Page, page 4, column 4.</ref>}}\n\nOn 16 July 1926, while convalescing in the hospital, Wead was promoted to lieutenant commander.<ref>{{cite book|title=Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps|date=1 January 1928|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=53|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AMH/USN/Naval_Registers/1928.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> At the encouragement of his fellow naval officers, he put his writing skills to work and started sending manuscripts to pulp book and magazine companies. During spring 1927, in the hope that his recovery was imminent and with the strong recommendation from Commander Marc A. Mitscher, Rear Admiral Moffett submitted Wead's name to Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Leigh]], Commander, Bureau of Naval Personnel, recommending Wead to be the new squadron commander of VF-6B (previously, VF-2) with duty aboard USS ''Langley''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, Wead was placed on the retired list, 28 May 1928 with a residence of Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite book|title=Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps|date=1 January 1929|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=352\u2013353|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AMH/USN/Naval_Registers/1929.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> He began his second career, [[screenplay]] writing, which subsequently occupied him throughout the 1930s and early 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===World War II service===\nIn the hours immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, from the library within his rented estate in Beverly Hills, Wead listened as bulletins interrupted regularly scheduled radio programs with updated details of the bombing. He also made a long-distance phone call to the Bureau of Aeronautics to speak with Rear Admiral Towers, requesting a recall to active duty. The phone call was followed up with a [[Western Union]] telegram to Captain Ralph Davison, USN.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIt was a chance to serve his country, again. Wead flew from California and arrived at [[Quonset Point Air National Guard Station|Naval Air Station Quonset Point]] where he worked as special aide to Captain Ralph Davison. Also, at NAS Quonset Point was Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin and his naval aide Captain John Madison \"Johnny\" Hoskins, USN. All these naval aviators communicated closely together in working out the details for the manning and training of ''carrier air groups'' for the newly commissioned aircraft carriers. With the approval from Davison, Wead was promoted to the temporary rank of commander in the US Naval Reserve, on 28 September 1942.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe story of Wead's sea-duty during World War II began in the air, flying from [[Port of San Francisco]] and landing at [[Honolulu Harbor]] aboard NC18605 [[Boeing 314 Clipper]] ''Dixie Clipper'',<ref>Pan American Airways, Inc., Transpacific Division.

From the Port of Honolulu Wead reported to [[Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet Headquarters (World War II)|Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet Headquarters]] as head of the Plans Division for Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet, Vice Admiral [[John Henry Towers]]. This shore-duty assignment was to await the return of {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|6}}. On the afternoon of 9 December 1943, Wead reported aboard ''Yorktown'' where he met with his old Naval Academy buddy Captain [[Joseph J. Clark]], USN, skipper of the ''Yorktown''. Representing the Plans Division, Wead's orders aboard ''Yorktown'' were to monitor and report on carrier aviation combat operations, most especially obtaining first-hand knowledge in the ability of consolidated CVs in a task force to readily replace their lost/damaged aircraft with replacements from close-by CVLs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fast Carriers: The Forging of an Air Navy|year=1968|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|location=New York|page=362}} Captain Logan C.

Sherman]], USN, wrote on carrier tactics in 1943, and Wead became an \"official observer\" in the testing of CINCPAC's carrier tactics while at sea aboard ''Yorktown''.</ref>\n\nHaving completed an earlier successful operation, ''Yorktown'' (assigned to Task Group 58.1, commanded by Rear Admiral [[John W. Reeves, Jr.]], USN) departed Pearl Harbor with Wead aboard on 16 January 1944. Wead took part in the attack on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] during [[Operation Flintlock (World War II)|Operation Flintlock]], an operation that involved four carrier groups. USS ''Yorktown'' then steamed to the newly established Pacific Fleet anchorage at [[Majuro]] Atoll, arriving about 4 February 1944. It was during this short eight-day anchorage period amongst the Pacific Fleet that Wead was transferred from ''Yorktown'' to a destroyer, and then to {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}.<ref>''U.S.S.

The carrier arrived at [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] on or about 16 April 1944 for a much-needed overhaul. It was at NAS&nbsp;Alameda, aboard ''Essex'' (pier-side), that Wead was given an official send-off from active duty just prior to his retirement. Wead was relieved of active duty on 21 July 1944, and was processed through the Personnel Department at NAS&nbsp;Alameda receiving his discharge papers and a train ticket for Los&nbsp;Angeles, California.

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|''Mahabharat'' (1988 TV series)]]\n*[[Shri Krishna (TV series)]]\n*[[Siya Ke Ram|Siya ke Ram (2015)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n* Karp, Jonathan and Williams, Michael. \"Reigning Hindu TV Gods of India Have Viewers Glued to Their Sets.\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 22 April 1998\n* {{cite book |last=Lutgendorf |first=Philip |title=The Life of a Text: Performing the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas |year=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-520-06690-1 }}\n* {{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/1146030\n| issn = 1054-2043\n| volume = 34\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 127\u2013176\n| last = Lutgendorf\n| first = Philip\n| title = Ramayan: The Video\n| journal = [[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]]\n| year = 1990\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| jstor = 1146030\n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lutgendorf |first=Philip |editor1-first=John Stratton |editor1-last=Hawley |editor2-first=Vasudha |editor2-last=Narayanan |title=The Life of Hinduism |series=The Life of Religion |year=2006 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-24913-4 |pages=140\u2013157 |chapter=All in the (Raghu) Family: A Video Epic in Cultural Context}}\n* National Endowment for the Humanities. \"Lessons of the Epics: The ''Ramayana''\".

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|''Mahabharat'' (1988 TV series)]]\n*[[Shri Krishna (TV series)]]\n*[[Siya Ke Ram|Siya ke Ram (2015)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n* Karp, Jonathan and Williams, Michael. \"Reigning Hindu TV Gods of India Have Viewers Glued to Their Sets.\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 22 April 1998\n* {{cite book |last=Lutgendorf |first=Philip |title=The Life of a Text: Performing the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas |year=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-520-06690-1 }}\n* {{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/1146030\n| issn = 1054-2043\n| volume = 34\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 127\u2013176\n| last = Lutgendorf\n| first = Philip\n| title = Ramayan: The Video\n| journal = [[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]]\n| year = 1990\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| jstor = 1146030\n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lutgendorf |first=Philip |editor1-first=John Stratton |editor1-last=Hawley |editor2-first=Vasudha |editor2-last=Narayanan |title=The Life of Hinduism |series=The Life of Religion |year=2006 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-24913-4 |pages=140\u2013157 |chapter=All in the (Raghu) Family: A Video Epic in Cultural Context}}\n* National Endowment for the Humanities. \"Lessons of the Epics: The ''Ramayana''\".

He is regarded as one of the most prolific comedians in Tamil cinema. He acted in over 1,000 [[Cinema of India|films]] from 1958 to 2008, performing in a variety of roles as comedian, lead roles, [[supporting actor]] and antagonist. He has also acted in Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi and Kannada films. Nagesh's style of comedy was largely inspired by Hollywood actor [[Jerry Lewis]]. Similarities between Nagesh and Lewis earned Nagesh the [[sobriquet]] the \"Jerry Lewis of India\". He was also a fantastic dancer. The song \"Kanni Nathiyoram\" in the movie ''Neerkumizhi'' shows some of his comic dance skills.\n\n== Early life ==\nNagesh was born as Cheyur Krishna Nageshwaran to Kannadiga parents. His parents were Krishnan Rao and Rukmani Ammal. He was born in [[Dharapuram]], now in [[Tiruppur district]], Tamil Nadu. Though his mother tongue is Kannada, he spent his entire life in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020150170100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Nagesh is no more | date=1 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307101513/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2604/stories/20090227260413300.htm |archivedate=7 March 2011}}</ref> While his school records give his date of birth as 8 February 1931, and his passport reads 27 August 1933, according to his elder brother's wife he was born on Maha Navami ([[Vasant Panchami|Saraswati Pooja]]).<ref name=\"musings\" /> \n\nHe left Dharapuram at an early age and moved to Madras city in search of a career. His roommates, the writer [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]] and director [[C. V. Sridhar]], later became established themselves as prominent personalities in the Tamil cinema field. He worked as a [[Clerk (position)|clerk]] in the [[Indian Railways]].\n\n== Film career ==\n[[File:Nagesh 2013 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nagesh on a 2013 stamp of India]]\n\n=== Early career ===\nEarly in his life, he saw the Tamil play ''[[Kambar, Tamil#Kamba Ramayanam|Kamba Ramayanam]]'', enacted by his colleagues, and felt that he could do a good job. He persuaded the secretary of the railway's cultural association to give him the role of a man suffering from stomach pain. [[M. G. Ramachandran|MGR]], then chief guest, seeing this play, in his speech praised Nagesh for his performance.

The film did not do well at the box office. Moreover, Nagesh had only a small role to play in the movie. In 1960, Nagesh made his debut in Kannada with ''[[Makkala Rajya]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/08195658/nagesh-entre-tamil-film-for-th.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134526/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/08195658/nagesh-entre-tamil-film-for-th.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNagesh won critical acclaim for his performance in the 1961 movie ''Thayilla Pillai''. But it was his 1962 hit ''[[Nenjil Or Aalayam]]'' which launched his career in the Tamil film industry. Nagesh was seen playing the lead role in ''[[Server Sundaram]]'' (1964), directed by the legendary Krishnan Panju. The movie was a remarkable hit and proved to be a great turning point in his career.\n\nThe song from this film \"Avalukenna... Azhagiya Mugam...\", written by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]] was a big hit.\n\n=== Rise to stardom ===\n''Server Sundaram'' marked Nagesh's rise to prominence. The film was about a restaurant waiter, \"server\" Sundaram, who struggles to make ends meet. He is in love with Radha ([[K. R. Vijaya]]), the daughter of the owner of the hotel in which he is working. The film is about how with the aid of his rich friend Raghavan ([[R. Muthuraman]]), server Sundaram gets a chance to act in movies and eventually, emerges as a rich and prominent actor. However, he is heartbroken when he learns that Radha is actually in love with Raghavan. While Nagesh drove viewers to laughter with his comical antics in the early scenes, his sensitive portrayal of a failed lover in the second half of the movie too earned widespread appreciation. The rags-to-riches story in the movie was actually based on Nagesh's own life. With ''Server Sundaram'', Nagesh earned critical acclaim for versatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/09203224/actor-nagesh-Server-Sundaram-c.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428080857/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/09203224/actor-nagesh-Server-Sundaram-c.html|archive-date=28 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Server Sundaram'' ensured that Nagesh was one of the most sought-after actors in the 1960s. At the height of his career, he acted in as much as 35 movies in a single calendar year, at one time shooting six movies simultaneously. He appeared in a cameo in the 1965 mythological ''[[Thiruvilayadal]]'', in which he portrayed the poor, simpleton temple priest Dharumi. The soliloquy which Dharmi indulges in, within the temple precincts, is regarded as one of the unforgettable scenes of Tamil cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/10180443/thiruvilaiyaal-film-nagesh-act.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230733/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/10180443/thiruvilaiyaal-film-nagesh-act.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He followed the success with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Kaadhalikka Neramillai]]'', where he wants to direct a film under his own production house, Oho Productions (but until the climax he does not make a film), ''[[Anbe Vaa]]'', ''Shanthi Nilayam'', ''[[Pattanathil Bhootham]]'' and ''[[Vietnam Veedu]]''. He played Mohan in ''[[Major Chandrakanth (1966 film)|Major Chandrakanth]]'', which was a popular hit and won for its lead actor [[Sundarrajan (actor)|Sundararajan]] the nickname \"Major\" Sundararajan. His portrayal of the detestable pimp Vaidhy in ''[[Thillana Mohanambal]]'' was noted for the way in which Nagesh blended humour with villainy. In most of his comic films, Nagesh paired with the actress [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]. In 1967, Nagesh acted in his first [[Bollywood|Hindi movie]], ''[[Farz (1967 film)|Farz]]''.\n\nApart from performing in supporting roles, Nagesh also acted as the main protagonist in a number of movies. ''Server Sundaram'' is one of them. Another performance which is well-remembered is his role as the poor struggling orphan Maadhu in ''[[Ethir Neechal (1968 film)|Ethir Neechal]]''. His sensitive and sympathetic portrayal of Maadhu evoked comparisons with top character actors of the day. [[Jayakanthan]] chose Nagesh to play the lead in the 1966 film ''Yaarukkaha Azhudhan'', overlooking [[Sivaji Ganesan]].\n\nManorama was paired with Nagesh regularly in films with M.G. Ramachandran as lead between 1960 and 1970 such as ''Thaali Bagyam, Vettaikaran, En Kadamai, Kanni Thai, Thayin Madiyil, Kadhal Vaganam, Chandrodhyam, Anbe Vaa, Padagotti, Panathotaam, Kaavalkaran, Kadhal Vagahnam, Vivasaaye, Thaikku Thalaimagan, Ther Thiruvizha, Thanipiravi, Thazhampoo'' and ''Thozhilali''. Other directors cast the Nagesh-Manorama pair in memorable films beginning from 1962, such as ''Nenjil Or Aalayam, Kungumam, Rakta Thilagam, Panjavarnakilli, Navarathiri, Puthiya Paravai, Anbu Karangal, Anubhavi Raja Anubhavi, Saraswathi Sabadham, Gowri Kalyanam, Galatta Kalyanam, Ner Vazhi, Ninaivin Nindraval, Poojaikku Vandamalar, Deiva Thirumagal, Deivathin Deivam, Shanti, Thenmazhai, Aannavin Asai, Andru Kanda Mugam, Seetha, Mani Makutam, Nagamali Azhagi, Kandan Karunai, Saadu Mirandal, Thaimel Aanai, Kaalam Vellum ,Annai Abirami, Thiruvarutchelvar, Karunthel Kannayiram, Kalangarai Vilakkam'' and ''Annamitta Kai''. Few films where they were not paired together include ''Server Sundaram, Madras to Pondicherry, Thillana Mohanambaal, Thiruvarul, Bommalattam'' and ''Nanbargal''. He played a negative character in ''Iru Thuruvam'' in 1971. He has a double role in ''Kai Naraya Kaasu'', wherein one character was evil and the other one innocent.\n\nCho acted alongside Nagesh in ''Thenmazhai, Ninaivil Nindraval, Ulagam Ivvalavudhaan'' and ''Bommalattam'' and each of them were box office hits. His critically acclaimed memorable performances were in films such as ''Anubhavi Raja Anubhavi, Server Sundaram, Ninivail Nindraval, Thenmazhai,  Rudra Thandavam, Chinnan Jiru Ulagam, Vairagiyam, Punnagai, Engal Vaadhiyar, Enna Mudhalali Sowkiyamma, Kai Naraya Kaasu, Soap Seepu Kannadi, Then Kinnam, Kalyana Oorvalam, Neerkumizhi, Major Chandrakanth'' and ''Kalahala Kapuram''. He was paired with Rama Prabha in ''Pudhiya Bhoomi'', ''Shanti Nilayam'' and also in another 12 films in Telugu. He was paired with Geethanjali in ''Panam Padaithavan'' and ''Sanagamam''. He was paired with Ammakutti Pushpamala in ''Ragasiya Police 115''. He was paired with K.R. Vijaya in many films such as ''Server Sundaram'', ''Kalyana Oorvalam'' and ''Dasavatharam''.\n\nActress Sachu was paired with Nagesh in films such as ''Kadhalikka Neram Illai, Kettikaran, Penn Deivam, Thunaivan, Patham Pasali, Sorgam, Athhaiya Mamiya'' and ''Vandha Marumagal''. Actress Madhavi Krishnan was paired opposite Nagesh in ''Pannakara Kudumbam, Periya Edathu Penn, Aayirathil Oruvan, Arasa Kattalai, Enga Veettu Pillai, Naan'' and ''Adhey Kangal''. His comedy was appreciated in films such as ''Parisu, Dheiva Thai, Kudiyirudha Koyil, Nawab Narkali, Veetuku Vandha Marumagal, Selva Magal, Nadodi, Aayiram Roobai'' and ''Naan Annaiyittal''. \n \nIn the 1970 movie ''Navakiragam'', K. Balachandar wanted to have Nagesh along with Manorama as his sidekick, but Nagesh refused, preferring to act without Manorama. Manorama was offended by this decision and has refused to act with Nagesh ever since. MGR did bring them together as the pair for one last time in ''Annamitta Kai'' in 1972. In the movies ''Raman Thediya Seethai, Kann Malar, Gomatha En Kulamatha, Anbe Aayure, Thygaam, Dheepam, Rudra Thandavam'' and ''Baghdad Perazhagi'' in the 1970s, there were scenes where they both were together, but there was no dialogue exchange between the two. However, with time, the relations between the two became normal by 1985 and the two acted in ''Micheal Madana Kamarajan'' in 1990 and ''Imisai Arasan23am Pulikesi''.\n\n=== Financial stress and decline in offers (1973\u20131977)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MGRP34swearing.jpg|thumb|right|Inauguration of Nagesh Theatre with [[MGR]]]] -->\nAfter ruining the chance of Manorama to be in K. Balachandar's movie ''Navagragam'' in 1970, and due to rumours of decline of his friendship with MGR, certain sections of people started avoiding giving him roles. His financial problems evolved and his acting chances declined, as the producers feared to offer him parts in their movies as he had turned to drinking. He was plagued by personal problems. His marriage to a Christian woman named Regina had fractured his relationship with his mother and other relatives. From the relationship, he had three sons, [[Anand Babu]], Ramesh Babu and Rajesh Babu, the first son going on to be an actor plagued by personal problems in his career. In 1973, his mother died causing him irreparable grief. The Nagesh theatre he owned in Chennai was on the verge of being seized for non-payment of dues. After Nagesh cleared the misunderstanding with MGR in 1972, he received offers from MGR to act again in his movies, in comedy roles, with the condition that he would not repeat his earlier mistakes. That's how Nagesh's career revived with films of MGR such as ''Ulagam Sutrum Valiban, Nalla Neram, Nalai Namadhe, Naan Yen Pirandhen, Uzhaikkum Karangale, Meenava Nanban'' and ''Urimai Kural''. But after MGR became Chief Minister, the producers again started ignoring Nagesh.\n\nNagesh acted in a few movies during this period, however as his talent was still the same, most of them were hits \u2013 ''Kalyanan Oorvalam, Anbe Aayure, Engalukkum Kadhal Varum, Thiruvarul, Pattampoochi, Payanam, Maharasi Vazhga, Dr. Siva, Dheepam, Ilaya Thalaimurai, Murugan Adimai'' and ''Nee Vazha Vendum''. One of his notable roles was a drunkard in the 1974 [[Kamal Hassan]]-starrer ''[[Apoorva Raagangal]]'', where he talks to his own shadow and hurls the empty glass upon it while saying \"Cheers\". In the theatres where the film was shown the audience imitated him and threw cups on the wall of the lobby during interval. He played writer Jayakanthan in the 1977 movie ''Sila Nerangalil Sila Manitharkal''.\n\n=== Resurgence ===\nNagesh's career enjoyed a resurgence from 1978 onwards when he acted in a number of movies. Nagesh appeared as himself in ''[[Thillu Mullu]]'', which was remake of ''[[Gol Maal]]'' (1979), a Hindi film. From 1978 onwards, his performances in films such as ''Varuvan Vadivelan, Adhirstakaran, Nizhal Nijamagiradhu, Oru Nadigai Nadagam Paarkiral, Gnana Kuzhandhai, Azhage Unnai Aarathikkiren, Bhama Rukmani, Amara Kaviyam, Vaa Kanna Vaa, Aayiram Nilave Vaa, Kalthoon, Kadal Meengal, Mohana Punnagai, Then Koodu, Paartha Gnabagam Illayo, Padikkadavan, Maaveeran, Cooliekkaran, Ivargal Varungala Thoongal'' and ''Makkal En Pakkam'' were appreciated. Right from the start of his career, he was known for doing clean comedy acts. He wanted to do only clean comedy roles even in the period between 1980 and 1988, when many other comedians were doing slapstick low quality comedy characters in the films and hence he chose to accept very few roles in this period. He was in the lead roles again with ''Rudra Thandavam'' and ''Engal Vadhiyar''. He started accepting roles of elderly people as well. He also directed the film ''Paartha Gnabagam Illayo'' in 1985. It was then when [[Kamal Haasan]] gave him a break with his project ''[[Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989 film)|Apoorva Sagodharargal]]''. This movie was a massive hit. Nagesh's villainous role was much appreciated. Nobody ever thought that Kamal Haasan could design a villainous role for an actor like Nagesh, that too after Nagesh had crossed the age of 55 in 1988. The movie was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Appu Raja''. He also played the villain in the Rajinikanth films ''[[Athisaya Piravi]]'' and ''Mounam Sammadham''. His negative roles included [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] [[scam|schemers]], than muscular giants.\n\n[[Kamal Haasan]] again gave a brilliant role for Nagesh in the comedy flick ''[[Michael Madana Kama Rajan]]''. Nagesh played the dishonest secretary Avinashi, who commissions a look-alike, Kameswaran to impersonate his boss, Madan, and lend him money from Madan's account. He even played a cadaver in Kamal Haasan's 1994 film ''Magalir Mattum''. His journey with Kamal Haasan continued. Director Priyadarshan gave Nagesh a good role in ''Gopura Vasalile''. Nagesh was very selective of the projects he did from 1990s. His performances in ''Indrudu Chandrudu, Pudhu Pudhu Ragangal, Raja Kaiya Vacha, Cheran Pandiyan, Thalapathi, Putham Pudhu Payanam, Purushan Enakku Arasan, Rickshaw Mama, Amma Ponnu, Nammavar, Marumagan, Gandeevam, Poove Unakkaga, Pagaivan, Thadayam, Ayudha Poojai, Poove Unakkaga''and ''Desiya Geetham'' were appreciated in the 1990s.\n\nNagesh had a good relationship with [[Kamal Haasan]], with whom he had co-starred in a variety of movies between 1975 and the 2000s. [[Kamal Haasan]] cast Nagesh in most of his self-productions regularly.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020159431000.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Nagesh&nbsp;\u2013 actor nonpareil | date=1 February 2009 | access-date=1 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202144326/http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020159431000.htm | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref> He also won the [[National Film Awards|National Award]] for his supporting role as the principal of a college troubled by rowdies, in the movie \"''[[Nammavar]]''\". [[Kamal Haasan]] plays a professor in this movie. His role as the make-up artist Joseph in the [[Kamal Haasan]] starrer ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]]'', in which he featured alongside another veteran, [[Gemini Ganesan]], was also appreciated. Cho and Nagesh again appeared together in ''Adhisiya Peravi'' and ''Kadhala Kadhala''.\n\n=== Later years ===\nNagesh had a series of supporting roles in the 2000s. Notable among them were those of [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]'s grandfather in ''[[Poove Unakkaga]]'', [[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]]'s father in ''[[Rhythm (2000 film)|Rhythm]]'', [[Pawan Kalyan]]'s Uncle Peddhananna in ''[[Toli Prema]]'', [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]'s grandfather Subbuni in ''[[Minnale]]'', Ajith Kumar's Grandfather in ''[[Poovellam Un Vasam]]'', Father Rozario in ''[[Kadhal Kondain]]'', Srikanth's grandfather in [[Bose (film)]], Silambarasan's grandfather in Saravana, Jeeva's father in Pori and [[Kamal Haasan]]'s father in ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]''. His handling of these roles gained him considerable appreciation from the public.\n\nNagesh acted in Tamil films till a few months before his death in 2009. Notable among some of his later movies were ''[[Panchathanthiram]]'', ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]'', ''[[Imsai Arasan 23m Pulikesi]]'' and his last appearance, ''[[Dasavathaaram]]''. However, an animated version of him was seen in the 2014 [[performance capture]] film ''[[Kochadaiiyaan]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nagesh in Kochadaiyaan|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/news-interviews/31108280_1_nagesh-rajinikanth-dual-role|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=5 March 2012|author=V Lakshmi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914151755/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/news-interviews/31108280_1_nagesh-rajinikanth-dual-role|archive-date=14 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/reviews/Movie-review-Kochadaiiyaan/articleshow/35525074.cms|title=Movie review: Kochadaiiyaan \u2013 Bangalore Mirror|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619223237/http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/reviews/Movie-review-Kochadaiiyaan/articleshow/35525074.cms|archive-date=19 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n* 1974 \u2014 [[Kalaimamani]] \n* [[42nd National Film Awards|1994]] \u2014 [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Nammavar]]\n* 1994 \u2014 [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize]] for [[Nammavar]]\n* [[43rd Filmfare Awards South|1995]] \u2014 [[Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award \u2013 South]] \n\n== Death ==\nNagesh was a [[chain smoker]] and a heavy drinker in his early days. However, he gradually gave up these habits when he was dangerously ill during the late 1970s and early 1980s. His health began to decline in late 2008 due to progressive heart ailments. He died on 31 January 2009 at the age of 75 due to diabetes and a heart ailment.<ref name=\"dinamalar.com\"/>\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n===1950s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#000;\"\n!

He is regarded as one of the most prolific comedians in Tamil cinema. He acted in over 1,000 [[Cinema of India|films]] from 1958 to 2008, performing in a variety of roles as comedian, lead roles, [[supporting actor]] and antagonist. He has also acted in Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi and Kannada films. Nagesh's style of comedy was largely inspired by Hollywood actor [[Jerry Lewis]]. Similarities between Nagesh and Lewis earned Nagesh the [[sobriquet]] the \"Jerry Lewis of India\". He was also a fantastic dancer. The song \"Kanni Nathiyoram\" in the movie ''Neerkumizhi'' shows some of his comic dance skills.\n\n== Early life ==\nNagesh was born as Cheyur Krishna Nageshwaran to Kannadiga parents. His parents were Krishnan Rao and Rukmani Ammal. He was born in [[Dharapuram]], now in [[Tiruppur district]], Tamil Nadu. Though his mother tongue is Kannada, he spent his entire life in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020150170100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Nagesh is no more | date=1 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307101513/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2604/stories/20090227260413300.htm |archivedate=7 March 2011}}</ref> While his school records give his date of birth as 8 February 1931, and his passport reads 27 August 1933, according to his elder brother's wife he was born on Maha Navami ([[Vasant Panchami|Saraswati Pooja]]).<ref name=\"musings\" /> \n\nHe left Dharapuram at an early age and moved to Madras city in search of a career. His roommates, the writer [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]] and director [[C. V. Sridhar]], later became established themselves as prominent personalities in the Tamil cinema field. He worked as a [[Clerk (position)|clerk]] in the [[Indian Railways]].\n\n== Film career ==\n[[File:Nagesh 2013 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nagesh on a 2013 stamp of India]]\n\n=== Early career ===\nEarly in his life, he saw the Tamil play ''[[Kambar, Tamil#Kamba Ramayanam|Kamba Ramayanam]]'', enacted by his colleagues, and felt that he could do a good job. He persuaded the secretary of the railway's cultural association to give him the role of a man suffering from stomach pain. [[M. G. Ramachandran|MGR]], then chief guest, seeing this play, in his speech praised Nagesh for his performance. From then onwards, Nagesh played small roles in various drama troupes.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020157350100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Actor Nagesh is no more | date=1 February 2009 | access-date=1 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316060518/http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020157350100.htm | archive-date=16 March 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, producer Balaji spotted Nagesh and gave him his first break in a film called ''Manamulla Marudhaaram''. The film did not do well at the box office. Moreover, Nagesh had only a small role to play in the movie. In 1960, Nagesh made his debut in Kannada with ''[[Makkala Rajya]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/08195658/nagesh-entre-tamil-film-for-th.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134526/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/08195658/nagesh-entre-tamil-film-for-th.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNagesh won critical acclaim for his performance in the 1961 movie ''Thayilla Pillai''. But it was his 1962 hit ''[[Nenjil Or Aalayam]]'' which launched his career in the Tamil film industry. Nagesh was seen playing the lead role in ''[[Server Sundaram]]'' (1964), directed by the legendary Krishnan Panju. The movie was a remarkable hit and proved to be a great turning point in his career.\n\nThe song from this film \"Avalukenna... Azhagiya Mugam...\", written by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]] was a big hit.\n\n=== Rise to stardom ===\n''Server Sundaram'' marked Nagesh's rise to prominence. The film was about a restaurant waiter, \"server\" Sundaram, who struggles to make ends meet. He is in love with Radha ([[K. R. Vijaya]]), the daughter of the owner of the hotel in which he is working. The film is about how with the aid of his rich friend Raghavan ([[R. Muthuraman]]), server Sundaram gets a chance to act in movies and eventually, emerges as a rich and prominent actor. However, he is heartbroken when he learns that Radha is actually in love with Raghavan. While Nagesh drove viewers to laughter with his comical antics in the early scenes, his sensitive portrayal of a failed lover in the second half of the movie too earned widespread appreciation. The rags-to-riches story in the movie was actually based on Nagesh's own life. With ''Server Sundaram'', Nagesh earned critical acclaim for versatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/09203224/actor-nagesh-Server-Sundaram-c.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428080857/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/09203224/actor-nagesh-Server-Sundaram-c.html|archive-date=28 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Server Sundaram'' ensured that Nagesh was one of the most sought-after actors in the 1960s. At the height of his career, he acted in as much as 35 movies in a single calendar year, at one time shooting six movies simultaneously. He appeared in a cameo in the 1965 mythological ''[[Thiruvilayadal]]'', in which he portrayed the poor, simpleton temple priest Dharumi. The soliloquy which Dharmi indulges in, within the temple precincts, is regarded as one of the unforgettable scenes of Tamil cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/10180443/thiruvilaiyaal-film-nagesh-act.html|title=Tamil Cinema news \u2013 Tamil Movies \u2013 Cinema seithigal|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230733/http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2012/05/10180443/thiruvilaiyaal-film-nagesh-act.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He followed the success with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Kaadhalikka Neramillai]]'', where he wants to direct a film under his own production house, Oho Productions (but until the climax he does not make a film), ''[[Anbe Vaa]]'', ''Shanthi Nilayam'', ''[[Pattanathil Bhootham]]'' and ''[[Vietnam Veedu]]''. He played Mohan in ''[[Major Chandrakanth (1966 film)|Major Chandrakanth]]'', which was a popular hit and won for its lead actor [[Sundarrajan (actor)|Sundararajan]] the nickname \"Major\" Sundararajan. His portrayal of the detestable pimp Vaidhy in ''[[Thillana Mohanambal]]'' was noted for the way in which Nagesh blended humour with villainy. In most of his comic films, Nagesh paired with the actress [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]. In 1967, Nagesh acted in his first [[Bollywood|Hindi movie]], ''[[Farz (1967 film)|Farz]]''.\n\nApart from performing in supporting roles, Nagesh also acted as the main protagonist in a number of movies. ''Server Sundaram'' is one of them. Another performance which is well-remembered is his role as the poor struggling orphan Maadhu in ''[[Ethir Neechal (1968 film)|Ethir Neechal]]''. His sensitive and sympathetic portrayal of Maadhu evoked comparisons with top character actors of the day. [[Jayakanthan]] chose Nagesh to play the lead in the 1966 film ''Yaarukkaha Azhudhan'', overlooking [[Sivaji Ganesan]].\n\nManorama was paired with Nagesh regularly in films with M.G. Ramachandran as lead between 1960 and 1970 such as ''Thaali Bagyam, Vettaikaran, En Kadamai, Kanni Thai, Thayin Madiyil, Kadhal Vaganam, Chandrodhyam, Anbe Vaa, Padagotti, Panathotaam, Kaavalkaran, Kadhal Vagahnam, Vivasaaye, Thaikku Thalaimagan, Ther Thiruvizha, Thanipiravi, Thazhampoo'' and ''Thozhilali''. Other directors cast the Nagesh-Manorama pair in memorable films beginning from 1962, such as ''Nenjil Or Aalayam, Kungumam, Rakta Thilagam, Panjavarnakilli, Navarathiri, Puthiya Paravai, Anbu Karangal, Anubhavi Raja Anubhavi, Saraswathi Sabadham, Gowri Kalyanam, Galatta Kalyanam, Ner Vazhi, Ninaivin Nindraval, Poojaikku Vandamalar, Deiva Thirumagal, Deivathin Deivam, Shanti, Thenmazhai, Aannavin Asai, Andru Kanda Mugam, Seetha, Mani Makutam, Nagamali Azhagi, Kandan Karunai, Saadu Mirandal, Thaimel Aanai, Kaalam Vellum ,Annai Abirami, Thiruvarutchelvar, Karunthel Kannayiram, Kalangarai Vilakkam'' and ''Annamitta Kai''. Few films where they were not paired together include ''Server Sundaram, Madras to Pondicherry, Thillana Mohanambaal, Thiruvarul, Bommalattam'' and ''Nanbargal''. He played a negative character in ''Iru Thuruvam'' in 1971. He has a double role in ''Kai Naraya Kaasu'', wherein one character was evil and the other one innocent.\n\nCho acted alongside Nagesh in ''Thenmazhai, Ninaivil Nindraval, Ulagam Ivvalavudhaan'' and ''Bommalattam'' and each of them were box office hits. His critically acclaimed memorable performances were in films such as ''Anubhavi Raja Anubhavi, Server Sundaram, Ninivail Nindraval, Thenmazhai,  Rudra Thandavam, Chinnan Jiru Ulagam, Vairagiyam, Punnagai, Engal Vaadhiyar, Enna Mudhalali Sowkiyamma, Kai Naraya Kaasu, Soap Seepu Kannadi, Then Kinnam, Kalyana Oorvalam, Neerkumizhi, Major Chandrakanth'' and ''Kalahala Kapuram''. He was paired with Rama Prabha in ''Pudhiya Bhoomi'', ''Shanti Nilayam'' and also in another 12 films in Telugu. He was paired with Geethanjali in ''Panam Padaithavan'' and ''Sanagamam''. He was paired with Ammakutti Pushpamala in ''Ragasiya Police 115''. He was paired with K.R. Vijaya in many films such as ''Server Sundaram'', ''Kalyana Oorvalam'' and ''Dasavatharam''.\n\nActress Sachu was paired with Nagesh in films such as ''Kadhalikka Neram Illai, Kettikaran, Penn Deivam, Thunaivan, Patham Pasali, Sorgam, Athhaiya Mamiya'' and ''Vandha Marumagal''. Actress Madhavi Krishnan was paired opposite Nagesh in ''Pannakara Kudumbam, Periya Edathu Penn, Aayirathil Oruvan, Arasa Kattalai, Enga Veettu Pillai, Naan'' and ''Adhey Kangal''. His comedy was appreciated in films such as ''Parisu, Dheiva Thai, Kudiyirudha Koyil, Nawab Narkali, Veetuku Vandha Marumagal, Selva Magal, Nadodi, Aayiram Roobai'' and ''Naan Annaiyittal''. \n \nIn the 1970 movie ''Navakiragam'', K. Balachandar wanted to have Nagesh along with Manorama as his sidekick, but Nagesh refused, preferring to act without Manorama. Manorama was offended by this decision and has refused to act with Nagesh ever since. MGR did bring them together as the pair for one last time in ''Annamitta Kai'' in 1972. In the movies ''Raman Thediya Seethai, Kann Malar, Gomatha En Kulamatha, Anbe Aayure, Thygaam, Dheepam, Rudra Thandavam'' and ''Baghdad Perazhagi'' in the 1970s, there were scenes where they both were together, but there was no dialogue exchange between the two. However, with time, the relations between the two became normal by 1985 and the two acted in ''Micheal Madana Kamarajan'' in 1990 and ''Imisai Arasan23am Pulikesi''.\n\n=== Financial stress and decline in offers (1973\u20131977)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MGRP34swearing.jpg|thumb|right|Inauguration of Nagesh Theatre with [[MGR]]]] -->\nAfter ruining the chance of Manorama to be in K. Balachandar's movie ''Navagragam'' in 1970, and due to rumours of decline of his friendship with MGR, certain sections of people started avoiding giving him roles. His financial problems evolved and his acting chances declined, as the producers feared to offer him parts in their movies as he had turned to drinking. He was plagued by personal problems. His marriage to a Christian woman named Regina had fractured his relationship with his mother and other relatives. From the relationship, he had three sons, [[Anand Babu]], Ramesh Babu and Rajesh Babu, the first son going on to be an actor plagued by personal problems in his career. In 1973, his mother died causing him irreparable grief. The Nagesh theatre he owned in Chennai was on the verge of being seized for non-payment of dues. After Nagesh cleared the misunderstanding with MGR in 1972, he received offers from MGR to act again in his movies, in comedy roles, with the condition that he would not repeat his earlier mistakes. That's how Nagesh's career revived with films of MGR such as ''Ulagam Sutrum Valiban, Nalla Neram, Nalai Namadhe, Naan Yen Pirandhen, Uzhaikkum Karangale, Meenava Nanban'' and ''Urimai Kural''. But after MGR became Chief Minister, the producers again started ignoring Nagesh.\n\nNagesh acted in a few movies during this period, however as his talent was still the same, most of them were hits \u2013 ''Kalyanan Oorvalam, Anbe Aayure, Engalukkum Kadhal Varum, Thiruvarul, Pattampoochi, Payanam, Maharasi Vazhga, Dr. Siva, Dheepam, Ilaya Thalaimurai, Murugan Adimai'' and ''Nee Vazha Vendum''. One of his notable roles was a drunkard in the 1974 [[Kamal Hassan]]-starrer ''[[Apoorva Raagangal]]'', where he talks to his own shadow and hurls the empty glass upon it while saying \"Cheers\". In the theatres where the film was shown the audience imitated him and threw cups on the wall of the lobby during interval. He played writer Jayakanthan in the 1977 movie ''Sila Nerangalil Sila Manitharkal''.\n\n=== Resurgence ===\nNagesh's career enjoyed a resurgence from 1978 onwards when he acted in a number of movies. Nagesh appeared as himself in ''[[Thillu Mullu]]'', which was remake of ''[[Gol Maal]]'' (1979), a Hindi film. From 1978 onwards, his performances in films such as ''Varuvan Vadivelan, Adhirstakaran, Nizhal Nijamagiradhu, Oru Nadigai Nadagam Paarkiral, Gnana Kuzhandhai, Azhage Unnai Aarathikkiren, Bhama Rukmani, Amara Kaviyam, Vaa Kanna Vaa, Aayiram Nilave Vaa, Kalthoon, Kadal Meengal, Mohana Punnagai, Then Koodu, Paartha Gnabagam Illayo, Padikkadavan, Maaveeran, Cooliekkaran, Ivargal Varungala Thoongal'' and ''Makkal En Pakkam'' were appreciated. Right from the start of his career, he was known for doing clean comedy acts. He wanted to do only clean comedy roles even in the period between 1980 and 1988, when many other comedians were doing slapstick low quality comedy characters in the films and hence he chose to accept very few roles in this period. He was in the lead roles again with ''Rudra Thandavam'' and ''Engal Vadhiyar''. He started accepting roles of elderly people as well. He also directed the film ''Paartha Gnabagam Illayo'' in 1985. It was then when [[Kamal Haasan]] gave him a break with his project ''[[Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989 film)|Apoorva Sagodharargal]]''. This movie was a massive hit. Nagesh's villainous role was much appreciated. Nobody ever thought that Kamal Haasan could design a villainous role for an actor like Nagesh, that too after Nagesh had crossed the age of 55 in 1988. The movie was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Appu Raja''. He also played the villain in the Rajinikanth films ''[[Athisaya Piravi]]'' and ''Mounam Sammadham''. His negative roles included [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] [[scam|schemers]], than muscular giants.\n\n[[Kamal Haasan]] again gave a brilliant role for Nagesh in the comedy flick ''[[Michael Madana Kama Rajan]]''. Nagesh played the dishonest secretary Avinashi, who commissions a look-alike, Kameswaran to impersonate his boss, Madan, and lend him money from Madan's account. He even played a cadaver in Kamal Haasan's 1994 film ''Magalir Mattum''. His journey with Kamal Haasan continued. Director Priyadarshan gave Nagesh a good role in ''Gopura Vasalile''. Nagesh was very selective of the projects he did from 1990s. His performances in ''Indrudu Chandrudu, Pudhu Pudhu Ragangal, Raja Kaiya Vacha, Cheran Pandiyan, Thalapathi, Putham Pudhu Payanam, Purushan Enakku Arasan, Rickshaw Mama, Amma Ponnu, Nammavar, Marumagan, Gandeevam, Poove Unakkaga, Pagaivan, Thadayam, Ayudha Poojai, Poove Unakkaga''and ''Desiya Geetham'' were appreciated in the 1990s.\n\nNagesh had a good relationship with [[Kamal Haasan]], with whom he had co-starred in a variety of movies between 1975 and the 2000s. [[Kamal Haasan]] cast Nagesh in most of his self-productions regularly.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020159431000.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Nagesh&nbsp;\u2013 actor nonpareil | date=1 February 2009 | access-date=1 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202144326/http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/01/stories/2009020159431000.htm | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref> He also won the [[National Film Awards|National Award]] for his supporting role as the principal of a college troubled by rowdies, in the movie \"''[[Nammavar]]''\". [[Kamal Haasan]] plays a professor in this movie. His role as the make-up artist Joseph in the [[Kamal Haasan]] starrer ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]]'', in which he featured alongside another veteran, [[Gemini Ganesan]], was also appreciated. Cho and Nagesh again appeared together in ''Adhisiya Peravi'' and ''Kadhala Kadhala''.\n\n=== Later years ===\nNagesh had a series of supporting roles in the 2000s. Notable among them were those of [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]'s grandfather in ''[[Poove Unakkaga]]'', [[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]]'s father in ''[[Rhythm (2000 film)|Rhythm]]'', [[Pawan Kalyan]]'s Uncle Peddhananna in ''[[Toli Prema]]'', [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]'s grandfather Subbuni in ''[[Minnale]]'', Ajith Kumar's Grandfather in ''[[Poovellam Un Vasam]]'', Father Rozario in ''[[Kadhal Kondain]]'', Srikanth's grandfather in [[Bose (film)]], Silambarasan's grandfather in Saravana, Jeeva's father in Pori and [[Kamal Haasan]]'s father in ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]''. His handling of these roles gained him considerable appreciation from the public.\n\nNagesh acted in Tamil films till a few months before his death in 2009.

In Canada, the finale aired simultaneously on May 6, 2004, on [[Global Television Network|Global]], and was viewed by 5.16 million viewers,<ref>http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/friends-finale-draws-over-5-million-in-canada/1000017927/?&er=NA</ref> becoming the highest viewed episode of the series, and also becoming the most viewed and highest-rated episode ever in Canada for a sitcom.\n\nThe series finale closes several long-running storylines. [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) confesses his love for [[Rachel Green]] ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), and they decide to resume their relationship; and [[Monica Geller]] ([[Courteney Cox]]) and [[Chandler Bing]] ([[Matthew Perry]]) adopt twins and move to the suburbs. The episode's final scene shows the group leaving their apartments for the final time and going to Central Perk<!-- This is the correct spelling. Central Park is a caf\u00e9 located near Central Park --> for one last cup of coffee.\n\nPrior to writing the episode, Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched finales from other sitcoms for inspiration. Kauffman found that she liked the ones that stayed true to the series. Filming took place at [[Warner Bros.]] Studios in [[Burbank, California]]; part one was taped on January 16, and part two on January 23. The finale was well received by critics and the cast members.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[Phoebe Buffay]] ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) and [[Joey Tribbiani]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]) pack the belongings of Monica and Chandler, who have accompanied [[List of recurring characters in Friends#Erica|Erica]] ([[Anna Faris]]) to the hospital. Rachel leaves Ross' bedroom after their apparent reunion in the previous episode. Erica gives birth to twins, much to the surprise of Monica and Chandler, who were expecting only one child. At his apartment, Joey shows Phoebe his house-warming gift for Monica and Chandler: a chick and duckling to replace the ones that died. Ross arrives and confesses to the pair that he slept with Rachel. Rachel emerges from her bedroom and, to his disappointment, tells Ross that their night together was \"the perfect way to say goodbye\".\n\nLater at the Central Perk<!-- This is the correct spelling. Central Perk is a caf\u00e9 located near Central Park. Central Perk is mentioned several times throughout the show. --> caf\u00e9, Phoebe convinces Ross to tell Rachel how he feels about her before she leaves for her new job in [[Paris]]. As he is about to tell her, Central Perk manager [[Gunther (Friends character)|Gunther]] ([[James Michael Tyler]]) confesses his love for Rachel. Back at Monica and Chandler's apartment, Ross decides not to tell Rachel, for fear of rejection. She prepares to leave to catch her flight, but waits long enough for Monica and Chandler to return with the twins, named Erica (after their biological mother) and Jack (after Monica's father). After Rachel leaves, Ross has a change of heart, and Phoebe takes him in her taxi to follow Rachel to the airport.\n\n===Part 2===\nJoey returns to his apartment to fetch the chick and the duck he was hiding, but finds they have become trapped in the [[table football|foosball]] table. Chandler and Joey decide to break it open when they cannot find any other way of getting the birds out. Phoebe's reckless driving gets her and Ross to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] and, after buying a ticket to get past security, they search the information boards for Rachel's flight number. When they cannot locate her flight on any of the information boards, Ross calls and checks the number with Monica but discovers they are at the wrong airport; Ross and Phoebe drove to JFK, while Rachel was flying out of nearby [[Newark Airport]]. Phoebe phones Rachel, who has already boarded her flight, to stall her for time. When a passenger ([[Jim Rash]]) overhears Phoebe saying there is a problem with the fictitious [[Phoebe Buffay#.22Regina Phalange.22|\"left phalange\"]] of the plane, he gets off the plane, prompting everyone else to leave. Chandler and Joey, who are emotionally attached to the foosball table, find they are unable to bear breaking it open, so Monica nonchalantly does it for them. After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them, and the two reaffirm their friendship with a long, tense hug.\n\nPhoebe and Ross arrive at the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable to deal with his confession and gets on the plane anyway. A dejected Ross returns home and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She changes her mind as she explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but then he hears a flight attendant telling her to sit down and she cannot get off the plane. The message cuts off as a fight ensues and Ross frantically tries fixing the answering machine, wondering out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel appears and says she did, and they get back together for good. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment and reminisce about how all of them had lived there at one point or another. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, \"Where?\" and they all laugh as they head down the hallway. The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and music===\nThe series' creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months prior to its airing on May 6. Before writing the episode, [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]], [[Marta Kauffman]] and [[Kevin S. Bright]] decided to watch the series finales of other sitcoms, paying attention to what worked and what did not. Kauffman found that they liked the ones which stayed true to the series, and they found [[The Last Show (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)|the finale]] of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' to be the gold standard. The writers had difficulty writing the finale, and spent several days thinking about the final scene without being able to write a word. Crane said that they did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show\".<ref name=\"friendfinale2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/15/DDGPB49B2D1.DTL&type=printable |title=''Friends'' challenge -- finding right words to say goodbye |accessdate=28 December 2008 |author=Hartlaub, Peter |date=January 15, 2004 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>\n\nThe music playing as the camera pans across the empty apartment at the end of the episode is \"[[Embryonic Journey (instrumental)|Embryonic Journey]]\" by [[Jefferson Airplane]].

[[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) confesses his love for [[Rachel Green]] ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), and they decide to resume their relationship; and [[Monica Geller]] ([[Courteney Cox]]) and [[Chandler Bing]] ([[Matthew Perry]]) adopt twins and move to the suburbs. The episode's final scene shows the group leaving their apartments for the final time and going to Central Perk<!-- This is the correct spelling. Central Park is a caf\u00e9 located near Central Park --> for one last cup of coffee.\n\nPrior to writing the episode, Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched finales from other sitcoms for inspiration. Kauffman found that she liked the ones that stayed true to the series. Filming took place at [[Warner Bros.]] Studios in [[Burbank, California]]; part one was taped on January 16, and part two on January 23. The finale was well received by critics and the cast members.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[Phoebe Buffay]] ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) and [[Joey Tribbiani]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]) pack the belongings of Monica and Chandler, who have accompanied [[List of recurring characters in Friends#Erica|Erica]] ([[Anna Faris]]) to the hospital. Rachel leaves Ross' bedroom after their apparent reunion in the previous episode. Erica gives birth to twins, much to the surprise of Monica and Chandler, who were expecting only one child. At his apartment, Joey shows Phoebe his house-warming gift for Monica and Chandler: a chick and duckling to replace the ones that died. Ross arrives and confesses to the pair that he slept with Rachel. Rachel emerges from her bedroom and, to his disappointment, tells Ross that their night together was \"the perfect way to say goodbye\".\n\nLater at the Central Perk<!-- This is the correct spelling. Central Perk is a caf\u00e9 located near Central Park. Central Perk is mentioned several times throughout the show. --> caf\u00e9, Phoebe convinces Ross to tell Rachel how he feels about her before she leaves for her new job in [[Paris]]. As he is about to tell her, Central Perk manager [[Gunther (Friends character)|Gunther]] ([[James Michael Tyler]]) confesses his love for Rachel. Back at Monica and Chandler's apartment, Ross decides not to tell Rachel, for fear of rejection. She prepares to leave to catch her flight, but waits long enough for Monica and Chandler to return with the twins, named Erica (after their biological mother) and Jack (after Monica's father). After Rachel leaves, Ross has a change of heart, and Phoebe takes him in her taxi to follow Rachel to the airport.\n\n===Part 2===\nJoey returns to his apartment to fetch the chick and the duck he was hiding, but finds they have become trapped in the [[table football|foosball]] table. Chandler and Joey decide to break it open when they cannot find any other way of getting the birds out. Phoebe's reckless driving gets her and Ross to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] and, after buying a ticket to get past security, they search the information boards for Rachel's flight number. When they cannot locate her flight on any of the information boards, Ross calls and checks the number with Monica but discovers they are at the wrong airport; Ross and Phoebe drove to JFK, while Rachel was flying out of nearby [[Newark Airport]]. Phoebe phones Rachel, who has already boarded her flight, to stall her for time. When a passenger ([[Jim Rash]]) overhears Phoebe saying there is a problem with the fictitious [[Phoebe Buffay#.22Regina Phalange.22|\"left phalange\"]] of the plane, he gets off the plane, prompting everyone else to leave. Chandler and Joey, who are emotionally attached to the foosball table, find they are unable to bear breaking it open, so Monica nonchalantly does it for them. After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them, and the two reaffirm their friendship with a long, tense hug.\n\nPhoebe and Ross arrive at the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable to deal with his confession and gets on the plane anyway. A dejected Ross returns home and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She changes her mind as she explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but then he hears a flight attendant telling her to sit down and she cannot get off the plane. The message cuts off as a fight ensues and Ross frantically tries fixing the answering machine, wondering out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel appears and says she did, and they get back together for good. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment and reminisce about how all of them had lived there at one point or another. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, \"Where?\" and they all laugh as they head down the hallway. The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and music===\nThe series' creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months prior to its airing on May 6. Before writing the episode, [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]], [[Marta Kauffman]] and [[Kevin S. Bright]] decided to watch the series finales of other sitcoms, paying attention to what worked and what did not. Kauffman found that they liked the ones which stayed true to the series, and they found [[The Last Show (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)|the finale]] of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' to be the gold standard. The writers had difficulty writing the finale, and spent several days thinking about the final scene without being able to write a word. Crane said that they did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show\".<ref name=\"friendfinale2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/15/DDGPB49B2D1.DTL&type=printable |title=''Friends'' challenge -- finding right words to say goodbye |accessdate=28 December 2008 |author=Hartlaub, Peter |date=January 15, 2004 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>\n\nThe music playing as the camera pans across the empty apartment at the end of the episode is \"[[Embryonic Journey (instrumental)|Embryonic Journey]]\" by [[Jefferson Airplane]].
