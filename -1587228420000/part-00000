The FDA required Takeda to conduct this safety study when the medicine was approved in 2009. The febuxostat drug labels already carry a warning and precaution about cardiovascular events because the clinical trials conducted before approval showed a higher rate of heart-related problems in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. These problems included heart attacks, strokes, and heart-related deaths. As a result, the FDA required an additional safety clinical trial after the drug was approved and on the market to better understand these differences, and that trial was finished recently.\nThe safety trial was conducted in over 6,000 patients with gout treated with either febuxostat or allopurinol. The primary outcome was a combination of heart-related death, non-deadly heart attack, non-deadly stroke, and a condition of inadequate blood supply to the heart requiring urgent surgery. The preliminary results show that overall, febuxostat did not increase the risk of these combined events compared to allopurinol. However, when the outcomes were evaluated separately, febuxostat showed an increased risk of heart-related deaths and death from all causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm585281.htm|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Febuxostat (Brand Name Uloric): Drug Safety Communication - FDA to Evaluate Increased Risk of Heart-related Death|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.FDA.gov|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Drug interactions==\nFebuxostat is contraindicated with concomitant use of [[theophylline]] and [[chemotherapeutic agents]], namely [[azathioprine]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]], because it could increase blood plasma concentrations of these drugs and thereby their toxicity.<ref name=label/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Ashraf Mozayani |author2=Lionel Raymon |title=Handbook of Drug Interactions: A Clinical and Forensic Guide |year=2011|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nFebuxostat is a non-purine-selective inhibitor of [[xanthine oxidase]].<ref name=label/> It works by [[Non-competitive inhibition|non-competitively]] blocking the [[molybdenum pterin]] center, which is the active site of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is needed to oxidize successively [[hypoxanthine]] and [[xanthine]] to uric acid. Thus, febuxostat inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing production of uric acid.

The primary outcome was a combination of heart-related death, non-deadly heart attack, non-deadly stroke, and a condition of inadequate blood supply to the heart requiring urgent surgery. The preliminary results show that overall, febuxostat did not increase the risk of these combined events compared to allopurinol. However, when the outcomes were evaluated separately, febuxostat showed an increased risk of heart-related deaths and death from all causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm585281.htm|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Febuxostat (Brand Name Uloric): Drug Safety Communication - FDA to Evaluate Increased Risk of Heart-related Death|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.FDA.gov|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Drug interactions==\nFebuxostat is contraindicated with concomitant use of [[theophylline]] and [[chemotherapeutic agents]], namely [[azathioprine]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]], because it could increase blood plasma concentrations of these drugs and thereby their toxicity.<ref name=label/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Ashraf Mozayani |author2=Lionel Raymon |title=Handbook of Drug Interactions: A Clinical and Forensic Guide |year=2011|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nFebuxostat is a non-purine-selective inhibitor of [[xanthine oxidase]].<ref name=label/> It works by [[Non-competitive inhibition|non-competitively]] blocking the [[molybdenum pterin]] center, which is the active site of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is needed to oxidize successively [[hypoxanthine]] and [[xanthine]] to uric acid. Thus, febuxostat inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing production of uric acid. Febuxostat inhibits both the oxidized and the reduced forms of xanthine oxidase by virtue of its tight binding to the molybdenum pterin site.<ref name=Love/>\n\n==History==\nFebuxostat was discovered by scientists at the Japanese pharmaceutical company [[Teijin]] in 1998.<ref>Teijin [http://www.teijin-pharma.com/project/story01.html Febuxostat Story] Page accessed June 25, 2015</ref> Teijin partnered the drug with [[TAP Pharmaceuticals]] in the US and [[Ipsen]] in Europe.<ref>Tomlinson B.
