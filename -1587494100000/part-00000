It opened in 1969 and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe building is, however, not in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] unlike the other buildings on the \"Altmarkt\" square. It is a stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared. It forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square and faces Wilsdruffer Strasse.  Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially, there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterwards the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Until 2012 ===\nBefore 2012, the multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could be transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, there are three [[water feature]]s which were created in 1969 on Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were later removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres.

The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo achieve the conversion, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with a recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Kulturpalast was reopened on April 28, 2017, with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.

It opened in 1969 and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe building is, however, not in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] unlike the other buildings on the \"Altmarkt\" square. It is a stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared. It forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square and faces Wilsdruffer Strasse.  Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially, there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterwards the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Until 2012 ===\nBefore 2012, the multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could be transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, there are three [[water feature]]s which were created in 1969 on Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were later removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres. In each basin there was a jet fountain on an area of 3 by 3 meters, 24 small heap fountains were installed at the edge of the basin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Kunst im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum|publisher=Kulturamt Dresden|year=1996|isbn=|location=Dresden, Germany|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\nDresden Altmarkt Sicht auf Kulturpalast 1 Panorama.jpg|Panorama of the Palace of Culture from the Altmarkt (February 2017)\nAltmarkt dresden kulturpalast2.JPG|View over the Altmarkt to the Kulturpalast, behind it the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], which was rebuilt until 2005 \nAltmarkt (Dresden)2009 06.jpg|Close-up with Frauenkirche and row building at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe, 2009\n20121008160DR DD Blick v d Frauenkirche Richtung Altmarkt.jpg|View from the Frauenkirche over the reborn Neumarkt, Kulturpalast and Altmarkt, 2012\nDD-Kulturpalast-Foyer.jpg|Foyer of the Kulturpalast\nDD-Kulturpalast-Obergeschoss-1.jpg|First floor with the wall frieze 'Unser sozialistisches Leben' ''Our socialist life''\nDD-Kulturpalast-Bibo-1.jpg|Central Library of the Municipal Libraries\n</gallery>\n\n== Conversion ==\n[[File:DD-Kulturpalast-Saal-04.jpg|thumb|The new concert hall]]\n\n=== Conversion planning ===\n[[File:Dresdner Philharmonie im Kulturpalast 2.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Philharmonic and the organ in the renovated Kulturpalast]]\nIn October 2013 the reconstruction work on the Palace of Culture began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2013/10/pm_050.php|title=Baustart im Dresdner Kulturpalast|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The festival hall was to be converted into a pure concert hall with a reduced capacity as a venue for the Dresden Philharmonic. The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo achieve the conversion, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Kulturpalast was reopened on April 28, 2017, with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose.

In most simple four-function calculators, such as the [[Windows Calculator|Windows calculator]] in Standard mode and those included with most early [[Operating system|operating systems]], each [[binary operation]] is executed as soon as the next operator is pressed, and therefore the [[order of operations]] in a mathematical expression is not taken into account. [[Scientific calculators]], including the Scientific mode in the Windows calculator and most modern software calculators, have buttons for brackets and ''can'' take order of operation into account. Also, for [[unary operation]]s, like \u221a or ''x''<sup>2</sup>, the number is entered first, then the operator; this is largely because the display screens on these kinds of calculators are generally composed entirely of [[Seven-segment display|seven-segment characters]] and thus capable  of displaying only numbers, not the functions associated with them. This mode of operation also makes it impossible to change the expression being input without clearing the display entirely.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Examples\n!

The first version is for simple calculators, showing how it is necessary to rearrange operands in order to get the correct result. The second version is for [[scientific calculator|scientific calculators]], where operator precedence is observed.\n\nImmediate-execution calculators are based on a mixture of infix and postfix notation: binary operations are done as infix, but unary operations are postfix. Because operators are applied one-at-a-time, the user must work out which operator key to use at each stage, and this can lead to problems.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harold Thimbleby |url=http://www.uclic.ucl.ac.uk/harold/srf/allcalcs.pdf |title=A new calculator and why it is necessary |publisher=Computing Science, Middlesex University, London, UK |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207044654/http://www.uclic.ucl.ac.uk/harold/srf/allcalcs.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-07 }}</ref><ref>Neville Holmes.

June 2005.</ref>\n\nProblems can occur because, for anything but the simplest calculation, in order to work out the value of a written formula, the user of a button-operated calculator is required to:\n* Rearrange the formula so that the value can be calculated by pressing buttons one at a time, while taking operator precedence and parentheses into account.\n* Use memory buttons to ensure that operations are applied in the correct order.\n* Use the special buttons {{keypress|\u00b1}} and {{keypress|1/''x''}}, that do not correspond to operations in the formula, for non-commutative operators.\n\nMistakes can be hard to spot because:\n* For the above reasons, the sequence of button presses may bear little resemblance to the original formula.\n* The operation carried out when a button is pressed is not always the same as the button, but could be a previously entered operation.\n\n[[File:Calculator-TI-30XA-rev2015.jpg|thumb|This TI-30XA scientific calculator uses immediate execution. It has a one-line, seven-segmented display, and cannot display operands or allow the entries to be edited.]]\n\n===Examples of difficulties===\n\nThe simplest example given by Professor Thimbleby of a possible problem when using an immediate-execution calculator is 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f(\u22125).<ref>Reference 11, section 2.</ref> As a written formula the value of this is \u221220 because the minus sign is intended to indicate a negative number, rather than a subtraction, and this is the way that it would be interpreted by a formula calculator.\n\nOn an immediate-execution calculator, depending on which keys are used and the order in which they are pressed, the result for this calculation may be different. Also there are differences between calculators in the way a given sequence of button presses is interpreted.<ref>{{clarify span|References 4, 5 and 6|date=January 2018}}.</ref> The result can be:\n* {{kbd|\u22121}}: If the subtraction button {{keypress|\u2212}} is pressed after the multiplication {{keypress|\u00d7}}, it is interpreted as a correction of the {{keypress|\u00d7}} rather than a minus sign, so that 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;5 is calculated.\n* {{kbd|20}}: If the change-sign button {{keypress|\u00b1}} is pressed before the 5, it isn't interpreted as \u22125, and 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is calculated.\n* {{kbd|\u221220}}: To get the right answer, {{keypress|\u00b1}} must be pressed last, even though the minus sign isn't written last in the formula.<ref name=\"Reference 4\">{{clarify span|Reference 4|date=January 2018}}.</ref>\n\nThe effects of operator precedence, parentheses and non-commutative operators, on the sequence of button presses, are illustrated by:\n* {{kbd|4 \u2212 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6}}: The multiplication must be done first, and the formula has to be rearranged and calculated as \u22125\u202f\u00d7\u202f6&nbsp;+&nbsp;4. So \u00b1 and addition have to be used rather than subtraction. When {{keypress|+}} is pressed, the multiplication is performed.\n* {{kbd|4\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)}}: The addition must be done first, so the calculation carried out is (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.

Different forms of this input scheme exist. In the '''algebraic entry system with hierarchy''' ('''AESH'''),<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> the precedence of basic mathematical operators is taken into account,<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> whereas calculators with '''algebraic entry system with parentheses''' ('''AESP''')<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> support the entry of parentheses.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> An input scheme known as '''algebraic operating system''' ('''AOS''')<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> combines both.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/>\n\nCalculators that use infix notation tend to incorporate a [[dot-matrix display]] to display the expression being entered, frequently accompanied by a seven-segment display for the result of the expression. Because the expression is not evaluated until it is fully entered, there is provision for editing the entered expression at any point prior to evaluation, as well as replaying entered expressions and their answers from memory.\n\nMost [[graphing calculators]] by [[Casio graphic calculators|Casio]] and [[Comparison of Texas Instruments graphing calculators|Texas Instruments]] use this method.

In most simple four-function calculators, such as the [[Windows Calculator|Windows calculator]] in Standard mode and those included with most early [[Operating system|operating systems]], each [[binary operation]] is executed as soon as the next operator is pressed, and therefore the [[order of operations]] in a mathematical expression is not taken into account. [[Scientific calculators]], including the Scientific mode in the Windows calculator and most modern software calculators, have buttons for brackets and ''can'' take order of operation into account. Also, for [[unary operation]]s, like \u221a or ''x''<sup>2</sup>, the number is entered first, then the operator; this is largely because the display screens on these kinds of calculators are generally composed entirely of [[Seven-segment display|seven-segment characters]] and thus capable  of displaying only numbers, not the functions associated with them.

June 2005.</ref>\n\nProblems can occur because, for anything but the simplest calculation, in order to work out the value of a written formula, the user of a button-operated calculator is required to:\n* Rearrange the formula so that the value can be calculated by pressing buttons one at a time, while taking operator precedence and parentheses into account.\n* Use memory buttons to ensure that operations are applied in the correct order.\n* Use the special buttons {{keypress|\u00b1}} and {{keypress|1/''x''}}, that do not correspond to operations in the formula, for non-commutative operators.\n\nMistakes can be hard to spot because:\n* For the above reasons, the sequence of button presses may bear little resemblance to the original formula.\n* The operation carried out when a button is pressed is not always the same as the button, but could be a previously entered operation.\n\n[[File:Calculator-TI-30XA-rev2015.jpg|thumb|This TI-30XA scientific calculator uses immediate execution. It has a one-line, seven-segmented display, and cannot display operands or allow the entries to be edited.]]\n\n===Examples of difficulties===\n\nThe simplest example given by Professor Thimbleby of a possible problem when using an immediate-execution calculator is 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f(\u22125).<ref>Reference 11, section 2.</ref> As a written formula the value of this is \u221220 because the minus sign is intended to indicate a negative number, rather than a subtraction, and this is the way that it would be interpreted by a formula calculator.\n\nOn an immediate-execution calculator, depending on which keys are used and the order in which they are pressed, the result for this calculation may be different. Also there are differences between calculators in the way a given sequence of button presses is interpreted.<ref>{{clarify span|References 4, 5 and 6|date=January 2018}}.</ref> The result can be:\n* {{kbd|\u22121}}: If the subtraction button {{keypress|\u2212}} is pressed after the multiplication {{keypress|\u00d7}}, it is interpreted as a correction of the {{keypress|\u00d7}} rather than a minus sign, so that 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;5 is calculated.\n* {{kbd|20}}: If the change-sign button {{keypress|\u00b1}} is pressed before the 5, it isn't interpreted as \u22125, and 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is calculated.\n* {{kbd|\u221220}}: To get the right answer, {{keypress|\u00b1}} must be pressed last, even though the minus sign isn't written last in the formula.<ref name=\"Reference 4\">{{clarify span|Reference 4|date=January 2018}}.</ref>\n\nThe effects of operator precedence, parentheses and non-commutative operators, on the sequence of button presses, are illustrated by:\n* {{kbd|4 \u2212 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6}}: The multiplication must be done first, and the formula has to be rearranged and calculated as \u22125\u202f\u00d7\u202f6&nbsp;+&nbsp;4. So \u00b1 and addition have to be used rather than subtraction. When {{keypress|+}} is pressed, the multiplication is performed.\n* {{kbd|4\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)}}: The addition must be done first, so the calculation carried out is (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)\u202f\u00d7\u202f4. When {{keypress|\u00d7}} is pressed, the addition is performed.\n* {{kbd|4\u202f/\u202f(5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)}}: One way to do this is to calculate (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)\u202f/\u202f4 first and then use the {{keypress|1/''x''}} button, so the calculation carried out is 1/[(5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6)/4].\n* {{kbd|4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7}}: The two multiplications must be done before the addition, and one of the results must be put into memory.<ref name=\"Reference 4\"/>\n\nThese are only simple examples, but immediate-execution calculators can present even greater problems in more complex cases. In fact, Professor Thimbleby claims that users may have been conditioned to avoid them for all but the simplest calculations.<ref>{{clarify span|Reference 11|date=January 2018}}, section 3.2, second paragraph.</ref>\n\n===Declarative and imperative tools===\n\nThe potential problems with immediate-execution calculators stem from the fact that they are [[imperative programming|imperative]].<ref>{{clarify span|Reference 11|date=January 2018}}, sections 1 and 10.</ref> This means that the user must provide details of ''how'' the calculation has to be performed.\n\nProfessor Thimbleby has identified the need for a calculator that is more automatic and therefore easier to use, and he states that such a calculator should be more [[declarative programming|declarative]].<ref name=\"Reference 11\">{{clarify span|Reference 11|date=January 2018}}.</ref> This means that the user should be able to specify only ''what'' has to be done, not how, and in which order, it has to be done.\n\nFormula calculators are more declarative because the typed-in formula specifies what is to be done, and the user does not have to provide any details of the step-by-step order in which the calculation has to be performed.\n\nDeclarative solutions are easier to understand than imperative solutions,<ref name=\"Reference 11\"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Roy E. Furman |title=Declarative Programming \u2013 Strategies for Solving Software Problems |url=http://www.articlesalley.com/article.detail.php/7013/178/Education/Internet/36/Declarative_Programming_-_Strategies_for_Solving_Software_Problems |date=July 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723100846/http://www.articlesalley.com/article.detail.php/7013/178/Education/Internet/36/Declarative_Programming_-_Strategies_for_Solving_Software_Problems |archivedate=2012-07-23 }}</ref> and there has been a long-term trend from imperative to declarative methods.<ref>David A.

Different forms of this input scheme exist. In the '''algebraic entry system with hierarchy''' ('''AESH'''),<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> the precedence of basic mathematical operators is taken into account,<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> whereas calculators with '''algebraic entry system with parentheses''' ('''AESP''')<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> support the entry of parentheses.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> An input scheme known as '''algebraic operating system''' ('''AOS''')<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/> combines both.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\"/>\n\nCalculators that use infix notation tend to incorporate a [[dot-matrix display]] to display the expression being entered, frequently accompanied by a seven-segment display for the result of the expression. Because the expression is not evaluated until it is fully entered, there is provision for editing the entered expression at any point prior to evaluation, as well as replaying entered expressions and their answers from memory.\n\nMost [[graphing calculators]] by [[Casio graphic calculators|Casio]] and [[Comparison of Texas Instruments graphing calculators|Texas Instruments]] use this method.

Reverse Polish notation is parenthesis-free, which usually leads to fewer button presses needed to perform an operation. By the use of a [[Stack (data structure)|stack]], one can enter formulas without the need to rearrange operands.\n\n[[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[HP calculators|calculators]] are well-known examples among calculators which use RPN. Early models, such as the [[HP-35]], used RPN entirely without any alternative methods.

An exception was made for applications from established artists, which they can directly send in their songs to RTP without having to go through the auditions. RTS received more than 400 applications, and a jury chose 12 candidates and 5 back-ups to compete in the national final, which were revealed on 13 January 2012.<ref name=\"Portugal3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/eurovision/2012/01/02/rtp-receives-more-than-400-applications/|title=RTP receives more than 400 applications|last=Costa|first=Nelson|date=2 January 2012|publisher=OIKOTIMES.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112052527/http://www.oikotimes.com/eurovision/2012/01/02/rtp-receives-more-than-400-applications/|archivedate=12 January 2012|accessdate=2 January 2012}}</ref> Three of the final twelve artists: Carlos Costa, Ricardo Soler and Rui Andrade didn't go through the auditions, using instead their recognition as moderate established artists.

Composers and authors will create new songs specially for the 12 candidates, in order to suit their vocal skills. The songs must be no longer than three minutes, and had to be performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Two music producers were also invited by RTP to work in coordination with the composers in produce the 12 entries.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
