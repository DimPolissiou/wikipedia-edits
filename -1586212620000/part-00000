Specifically focused on serving the commerce needs of enterprise organizations, Elastic Path is known for revolutionizing commerce by pushing the industry forward and always existing on the leading edge of commerce technology innovation.\n\n== History ==\nElastic Path was started by Harry Chemko in 2000, with co-founders Mark Williams, Ryan Orr, and Jason Billingsley, after completing university with a $15,000 start-up loan from a non-profit organization. Based on the idea that there had to be a better way to build enterprise software, they had a vision for solutions that were simpler, intelligently architected and provided ultimate flexibility.\n\nDuring the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Elastic Path signed on to power the tech behind the official Olympics online store. They experienced the pain points first-hand of the modern retailer when it came to things like huge surges in volume, extensive product catalogues and accommodating shoppers from all over the world. Additionally, it became clear to CEO Harry Chemko that the proliferation of digital experience channels would only accelerate, creating an opportunity for brands to commerce-enable all new and emerging customer touchpoints.\n\nAs a result, Elastic Path built the first API centric commerce platform, incorporating \u201cshopping APIs\u201d to create a purchase experience within any device or touchpoint, calling this concept \u201cheadless commerce.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Elastic Path launched [https://vimeo.com/70425078 Cortex]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/70425078|title=Cortex - A revolutionary way to build your digital empire|last=Chemko|first=Harry|date=2013|website=Vimeo|access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref>, completely decoupling digital experiences from the back-end system while providing a layer of commerce business logic.

Specifically focused on serving the commerce needs of enterprise organizations, Elastic Path is known for revolutionizing commerce by pushing the industry forward and always existing on the leading edge of commerce technology innovation.\n\n== History ==\nElastic Path was started by Harry Chemko in 2000, with co-founders Mark Williams, Ryan Orr, and Jason Billingsley, after completing university with a $15,000 start-up loan from a non-profit organization. Based on the idea that there had to be a better way to build enterprise software, they had a vision for solutions that were simpler, intelligently architected and provided ultimate flexibility.\n\nDuring the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Elastic Path signed on to power the tech behind the official Olympics online store. They experienced the pain points first-hand of the modern retailer when it came to things like huge surges in volume, extensive product catalogues and accommodating shoppers from all over the world. Additionally, it became clear to CEO Harry Chemko that the proliferation of digital experience channels would only accelerate, creating an opportunity for brands to commerce-enable all new and emerging customer touchpoints.\n\nAs a result, Elastic Path built the first API centric commerce platform, incorporating \u201cshopping APIs\u201d to create a purchase experience within any device or touchpoint, calling this concept \u201cheadless commerce.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Elastic Path launched [https://vimeo.com/70425078 Cortex]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/70425078|title=Cortex - A revolutionary way to build your digital empire|last=Chemko|first=Harry|date=2013|website=Vimeo|access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref>, completely decoupling digital experiences from the back-end system while providing a layer of commerce business logic. This release was revolutionary because it made the creation of innovative commerce experiences accessible to business and marketing users without having to rely on IT teams.\n\nThis first of its kind release could mediate resources from multiple systems and allow them to be added, removed or upgraded without effecting the customer experience. More importantly, it supported continuous customer journeys across multiple touchpoints and, quick on-boarding of new touchpoints and capabilities.\n\nIn 2019, Elastic Path rebranded and announced their next commerce revolution is in B2B commerce.

A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning, overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/ |title=What the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Is and Isn't |last=Yarkoni |first=Tal |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to estimate their class rank correctly after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/> The study \"Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability\" (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of [[illusory superiority]] to test subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ames |first=Daniel R. |last2=Kammrath |first2=Lara K. |date=September 2004 |title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf |journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |language=en |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=187\u2013209 |doi=10.1023/b:jonb.0000039649.20015.0e |issn=0191-5886 |citeseerx=10.1.1.413.8323}}</ref>\n\nThe study \"How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance\" (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues.

Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures,\n \nThe most common graphical convention is the Kruger-Dunning type graph typified by Figure 1 in the seminal paper.<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the Effect.

These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the Effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the Effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the Effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions.\n\nTo expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence.

After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class.

Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning, overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/ |title=What the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Is and Isn't |last=Yarkoni |first=Tal |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform.

Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident.

The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence. A third Numeracy paper by these researchers<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Rachel|last2=Nuhfer|first2=Edward|last3=Moon|first3=Kali|last4=Fleisher|first4=Steven|last5=Walter|first5=Paul|last6=Wirth|first6=Karl|date=2019|title=Paired Measures of Competence and Confidence Illuminate Impacts of Privilege on College Students|journal=Numeracy|volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.12.2.2}}</ref> reports from a database of over 3000 participants to illuminate the effects of privilege on different ethnic and gender groups of college students.
