The film features the voices of [[Raymond Ochoa]], Jack Bright, [[Sam Elliott]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[A. J.

Millions of years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' corn farmers Henry and Ida have children: Libby, Buck and the runt, Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to \"make their mark\" (a mud-print on the family's corn silo), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a caveboy, but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a flash flood before being swept away and killed.\n\nWithout his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his father's death, chases him into a river, where he hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day, Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him \"Spot\". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[pterodactyls]], led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out.\n\nThe group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers, and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of four rustler ''[[Velociraptor]]'', allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven out of the pasture, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye.

Ream noted \"Nature can overcome anything, including a massive dinosaur.\" In order to achieve the needed realism, the film's team traveled to the [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]], spending time in [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], [[Juntura, Oregon]], and southern [[Montana]]. Production designer [[Harley Jessup]] stated: \"The area has a fantastic variety of landscapes, ranging from the Jackson Valley and the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], we studied the grasslands of Montana and the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]], then incorporated all of it in Arlo's journey.\" To use the landscapes that they had experienced, the filmmakers used data from the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], and satellite images from [[Google Earth]]. The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on. According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi, this gave Sohn \"the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real.\" In addition, ''The Good Dinosaur'' features three-dimensional, volumetric clouds. In previous Pixar films, clouds have been \"painted\" onto the sets. Light and photography director Sharon Calahan explained: \"Storm clouds are almost like a villain in the film. Plus, it's very labor-intensive to paint clouds, and they're in almost every scene.\" Calahan also noted \"These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them, which we've never been able to properly do before.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\"/><ref name=\"Lesnick\"/>\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo-realistic, they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow. In terms of animating Arlo, animators Rob Thompson and Kevin O'Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion. Thompson stated: \"One of the most intimidating things to animate is a quadruped, because there's so much to them and there's so much to manage. It's very easy to make it not work if you don't know what you're managing. Locomotion is all about efficiency, a lot of times you think, 'We're animating a big, heavy character. We should slam those feet. That'll make it feel heavy.' The truth is, that's not efficient. That wouldn't be great for the legs.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\">{{cite web|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|title=Pixar Studios Doubles Effects In Upcoming Film \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|newspaper=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Lesnick\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=The Good Dinosaur Story: Behind the Scenes at Pixar|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Zacuto\"/> A system where Arlo's head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up, was therefore created. To get an idea of the scale of Arlo, a complete full-size model was built out of card and foam core. In total ''The Good Dinosaur'' took up 300[[Byte|TB]] of server space, ten times as much space as ''[[Monsters University]]'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-pixar-changed-all-the-rules-to-make-the-good-dinosa-1735364564|title=How Pixar Changed All The Rules To Make The Good Dinosaur A Stunning Masterpiece|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nArlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the \"boy\" inside the dinosaur. Sohn explained \"When Arlo gets lost in the wilderness, you need to worry that he's out of his element and in danger of getting killed, rather than just thinking 'You're an animal. Why don't you just turn around and eat some leaves?'\" He additionally stated \"If you put like a realistic dinosaur in the woods, eat some leaves, you're fine... But we really wanted to play with that twist of this is a boy out there. A dinosaur boy for sure, but trying to infuse those qualities into him... And also keeping him in a world that had an arc to itself. That it would start off being beautiful and then become dangerous. When we had these designs of the trees where they were a little bit more blocky and a little bit more graphic. We put Arlo in front of it, it's like 'ooh that kind of is cool, but boy, it doesn't feel like it's that dangerous.' Like when we get a rock stuck on him, it didn't feel like anything 'cause when we went on our research trips, boy that idea of like you can get, you could die by a small thing like having a rock on your foot. Or you could die by a huge thing like an avalanche, which we tried to kind of explore in the film. So that was one of our main intents.\"<ref name=io9Anders/><ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Interview: Director Peter Sohn Talks \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-sohn-good-dinosaur-interview/|website=[[slashfilm.com|/Film]]|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the film's setting, Sohn stated \"Pixar is all about the 'what if' question... 'What if the asteroid missed the earth?' Yeah, we went down the road of: they could be cooking in a dino diner; they could be in space; they could be in anything. But then there was a drawing of a dinosaur farming that kind of sparked people of the idea of 'he's working hard and this character needs to survive out there.' All of the American dinosaur bones are found in the northwest\u2014from Montana, to [[Oregon]], to [[Wyoming]], and [[the Dakotas]], so the combination of hardworking farm families and the west really brought us into that frontier world immediately... [S]o we started doing research. We started finding all of these people who were surviving out there on the land. They were either cultivating the cattle, or were ranchers in Oregon, or were farmers in the Midwest. It just kept teaching us how much we want to honor this world, and how hard it is to survive out there. It started dictating the world itself.\"<ref name=\"DisneyInsider\"/>\n\nSince ''The Good Dinosaur'' is set in a world in which dinosaurs never became extinct, they were instead able to evolve. Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and carnivores like the ''T. rex'' become ranchers.

The film follows a young and timid ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' named Arlo, who meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a harsh, dangerous and mysterious landscape. The film features the voices of [[Raymond Ochoa]], Jack Bright, [[Sam Elliott]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[A. J.

Millions of years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' corn farmers Henry and Ida have children: Libby, Buck and the runt, Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to \"make their mark\" (a mud-print on the family's corn silo), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a caveboy, but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a flash flood before being swept away and killed.\n\nWithout his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his father's death, chases him into a river, where he hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day, Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him \"Spot\". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[pterodactyls]], led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out.\n\nThe group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers, and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of four rustler ''[[Velociraptor]]'', allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven out of the pasture, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye. Arlo finally arrives home to his mother and siblings, and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--Do not add voice actors without official sources.--> \n<!--The species names must be consistent with the sources.-->\n* [[Raymond Ochoa]] as Arlo, a young ''[[Apatosaurus]]''<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/06/12/meet-the-new-cast-of-disneypixars-the-good-dinosaur/|title=Meet the New Cast of Disney\u2022Pixar\u2019s The Good Dinosaur |publisher=The Walt Disney Company|date= June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=\u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019 Preview: How John Ford and Hayao Miyazaki Helped Inspire Pixar|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-good-dinosaur-preview-how-john-ford-and-hayao-miyazaki-helped-inspire-pixar/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=June 18, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n** Jack McGraw as Young Arlo\n* Jack Bright as Spot, a 7-year-old human [[Caveman|caveboy]] who befriends Arlo<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Butch, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' who runs a \"ranch\" filled with prehistoric \"longhorns\"<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/>\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Ramsey, Butch's daughter<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[A.

Ream noted \"Nature can overcome anything, including a massive dinosaur.\" In order to achieve the needed realism, the film's team traveled to the [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]], spending time in [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], [[Juntura, Oregon]], and southern [[Montana]]. Production designer [[Harley Jessup]] stated: \"The area has a fantastic variety of landscapes, ranging from the Jackson Valley and the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], we studied the grasslands of Montana and the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]], then incorporated all of it in Arlo's journey.\" To use the landscapes that they had experienced, the filmmakers used data from the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], and satellite images from [[Google Earth]]. The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on. According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi, this gave Sohn \"the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real.\" In addition, ''The Good Dinosaur'' features three-dimensional, volumetric clouds. In previous Pixar films, clouds have been \"painted\" onto the sets. Light and photography director Sharon Calahan explained: \"Storm clouds are almost like a villain in the film. Plus, it's very labor-intensive to paint clouds, and they're in almost every scene.\" Calahan also noted \"These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them, which we've never been able to properly do before.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\"/><ref name=\"Lesnick\"/>\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo-realistic, they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow. In terms of animating Arlo, animators Rob Thompson and Kevin O'Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion. Thompson stated: \"One of the most intimidating things to animate is a quadruped, because there's so much to them and there's so much to manage. It's very easy to make it not work if you don't know what you're managing. Locomotion is all about efficiency, a lot of times you think, 'We're animating a big, heavy character. We should slam those feet. That'll make it feel heavy.' The truth is, that's not efficient. That wouldn't be great for the legs.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\">{{cite web|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|title=Pixar Studios Doubles Effects In Upcoming Film \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|newspaper=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Lesnick\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=The Good Dinosaur Story: Behind the Scenes at Pixar|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Zacuto\"/> A system where Arlo's head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up, was therefore created. To get an idea of the scale of Arlo, a complete full-size model was built out of card and foam core. In total ''The Good Dinosaur'' took up 300[[Byte|TB]] of server space, ten times as much space as ''[[Monsters University]]'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-pixar-changed-all-the-rules-to-make-the-good-dinosa-1735364564|title=How Pixar Changed All The Rules To Make The Good Dinosaur A Stunning Masterpiece|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nArlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the \"boy\" inside the dinosaur. Sohn explained \"When Arlo gets lost in the wilderness, you need to worry that he's out of his element and in danger of getting killed, rather than just thinking 'You're an animal. Why don't you just turn around and eat some leaves?'\" He additionally stated \"If you put like a realistic dinosaur in the woods, eat some leaves, you're fine... But we really wanted to play with that twist of this is a boy out there. A dinosaur boy for sure, but trying to infuse those qualities into him... And also keeping him in a world that had an arc to itself. That it would start off being beautiful and then become dangerous. When we had these designs of the trees where they were a little bit more blocky and a little bit more graphic. We put Arlo in front of it, it's like 'ooh that kind of is cool, but boy, it doesn't feel like it's that dangerous.' Like when we get a rock stuck on him, it didn't feel like anything 'cause when we went on our research trips, boy that idea of like you can get, you could die by a small thing like having a rock on your foot. Or you could die by a huge thing like an avalanche, which we tried to kind of explore in the film. So that was one of our main intents.\"<ref name=io9Anders/><ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Interview: Director Peter Sohn Talks \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-sohn-good-dinosaur-interview/|website=[[slashfilm.com|/Film]]|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the film's setting, Sohn stated \"Pixar is all about the 'what if' question... 'What if the asteroid missed the earth?' Yeah, we went down the road of: they could be cooking in a dino diner; they could be in space; they could be in anything. But then there was a drawing of a dinosaur farming that kind of sparked people of the idea of 'he's working hard and this character needs to survive out there.' All of the American dinosaur bones are found in the northwest\u2014from Montana, to [[Oregon]], to [[Wyoming]], and [[the Dakotas]], so the combination of hardworking farm families and the west really brought us into that frontier world immediately... [S]o we started doing research. We started finding all of these people who were surviving out there on the land. They were either cultivating the cattle, or were ranchers in Oregon, or were farmers in the Midwest. It just kept teaching us how much we want to honor this world, and how hard it is to survive out there. It started dictating the world itself.\"<ref name=\"DisneyInsider\"/>\n\nSince ''The Good Dinosaur'' is set in a world in which dinosaurs never became extinct, they were instead able to evolve. Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and carnivores like the ''T. rex'' become ranchers.

It has never been licensed to any local affiliate broadcast TV station. From 1959 until 1991, it was an annual tradition on American commercial network television.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman.

For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p.

Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer.

As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily.

Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day.

''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], Bert Lahr, and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\n*1968 - NBC - Saturday, April 20 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7\u20138 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1\u20138 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6\u20138 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like ''Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo'', by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'', by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&start=0 | title=Google}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* '''Bangalees''', an [[exonym]] for [[Bengalis]], was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President [[Ziaur Rahman]], the constitutional term was changed to ''Bangladeshi'', as part of efforts to promote [[Bangladeshi nationalism]].<ref name=\"Murshid 2001 165\"/>\n* '''East Bengalis''', a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the [[Partition of Bengal (disambiguation)|\nPartition of Bengal]]. The territory was known as ''East Bengal'' twice in the 20th century. It was used for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in the [[British Raj]] between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]'s province of [[East Bengal]] between 1947 and 1955.\n* '''Bangals''', a term used informally in neighboring [[India]] to refer to Bangladeshis. ''[[Bangal]]'' is also the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] term for ''Bengal''. In [[West Bengal]], ''Bangal'' is widely used slang among upper-class subgroups in Dhaka to differentiate families from villages in Bangladesh, the opposite then being ''[[Ghoti people|Ghoti]]'', which once referred to people from West Bengal.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic]] ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9781598846607| last1=Minahan| first1=James B| date=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Bengalis===\n[[File:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show.]]\nApproximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are [[Bengalis]]. East Bengal was a prosperous [[melting pot]] for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of [[Bengali dialects|dialects]].\n\n90% of the population are [[Bengali Muslim]]s (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest [[Islam by country|Muslim majority country]] after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after [[Arab Muslims]]. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiya]] branches. [[Bengali Hindus]] are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10\u201312 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. There are an estimated 400,000 [[Bengali Christians]] and 500,000 [[Bengali Buddhists]].\n\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.\n\n===Non-Bengali Muslims===\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali [[Muslim]] immigrants from different parts of [[South Asia]]. They include affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class, particularly [[Nizari Ismailism]] adherents.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theismaili.org/heritage-expressions/new-dhaka-jamatkhana-seen-symbol-confidence-bangladesh |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805132543/https://www.theismaili.org/heritage-expressions/new-dhaka-jamatkhana-seen-symbol-confidence-bangladesh |archive-date=5 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They also include former [[Stranded Pakistanis]] and their descendants. Bangladesh's non-Bengali Muslims are usually fluent in both Bengali and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].\n\n===Tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts===\nIn southeastern Bangladesh, the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] frontier has a district history. It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several [[indigenous people|indigenous]] ethnic groups in the three hill districts of [[Rangamati]], [[Bandarban]] and [[Khagrachari]]. The three largest communities in the region have a [[Raja]] as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\n* The [[Chakma people]] are the largest tribe of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the second largest indigenous ethnic group of Bangladesh after Bengalis. A [[Tibeto-Burman]] community, they have been greatly influenced by [[Bengali culture]], including in their native [[Chakma language]], a branch of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages]]. Most Chakmas are concentrated in [[Rangamati District]]. The community is headed by the [[Chakma Raja]].

The individual [[nuclear family]] often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (''ghor''). Above the ''bari'' level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.<ref name=rs>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Rural Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (''shomaj'' or ''milat''). Among the functions of a ''shomaj'' might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a [[mullah]]. An informal council of ''shomaj'' elders (''matabdars'' or ''shordars'') settles village disputes. Factional competition between the ''motobdars'' is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.<ref name=rs/>\n\nGroups of homes in a village are called ''Paras'', and each ''para'' has its own name. Several ''paras'' constitute a ''mauza'', the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common [[thatched]] [[bamboo]] huts.<ref name=rs/>\n\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\n\n==Urban society==\n[[File:Dhaka Skyline at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|View of downtown [[Dhaka]], the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities]]\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> [[Dhaka]] is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous [[megacities]]. Other important cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Jessore]], [[Barisal]], [[Comilla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Mymensingh]]. Most urban centers are rural administrative [[town]]s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of [[upazila]]s.<ref name=us>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Urban Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\n==Identity==\nBangladesh is noted for [[cultural pluralism]] within a [[Bengali Muslim]] majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The [[Bangla language]] is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced [[socialism]] under a secular parliamentary system. [[Military coups in Bangladesh|Military coups]] ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the [[free market]] and promoted moderate [[Islamism]]. In 1988, [[Islam]] was made the [[state religion]]. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of [[Secularity|separation of mosque and state]] in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=BANGLADESH|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=United States Department of State|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace treaty]] in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect [[adivasi]] land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of ''Bangalee'' as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Bangladesh}}\nCulture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religions are Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism,  which have played a critical part in influencing the country's culture.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Wikipedia in Bangla.svg|thumb|The word ''Wikipedia'' written in the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]]]\nThe official language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. [[Bengali dialects]] vary between different regions of Bangladesh.\n\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at [[Mahasthangarh]] and is written in the [[Brahmi script]]. The language is [[Magadhi Prakrit]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mahasthan_Brahmi_Inscription |title = Mahasthan Brahmi Inscription - Banglapedia}}</ref> The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from [[Apabhramsa]], between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]], but later became distinct. It became an official language of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by the number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. The language was modernized during the [[Bengali Renaissance]] in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], Assamese, Odia and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]]s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\n\nThe [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\n\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Marma language|Marma]], Chakma and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bisnupriya Manipuri]].\n\n=== Surnames ===\n{{Main|Bengali name}}\nBangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bangladeshis]]\n* [[Bangladeshi diaspora]]\n* [[Demographics of

Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like ''Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo'', by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'', by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&start=0 | title=Google}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* '''Bangalees''', an [[exonym]] for [[Bengalis]], was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President [[Ziaur Rahman]], the constitutional term was changed to ''Bangladeshi'', as part of efforts to promote [[Bangladeshi nationalism]].<ref name=\"Murshid 2001 165\"/>\n* '''East Bengalis''', a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the [[Partition of Bengal (disambiguation)|\nPartition of Bengal]]. The territory was known as ''East Bengal'' twice in the 20th century. It was used for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in the [[British Raj]] between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]'s province of [[East Bengal]] between 1947 and 1955.\n* '''Bangals''', a term used informally in neighboring [[India]] to refer to Bangladeshis. ''[[Bangal]]'' is also the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] term for ''Bengal''. In [[West Bengal]], ''Bangal'' is widely used slang among upper-class subgroups in Dhaka to differentiate families from villages in Bangladesh, the opposite then being ''[[Ghoti people|Ghoti]]'', which once referred to people from West Bengal.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic]] ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9781598846607| last1=Minahan| first1=James B| date=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Bengalis===\n[[File:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show.]]\nApproximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are [[Bengalis]]. East Bengal was a prosperous [[melting pot]] for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of [[Bengali dialects|dialects]].\n\n90% of the population are [[Bengali Muslim]]s (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest [[Islam by country|Muslim majority country]] after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after [[Arab Muslims]]. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiya]] branches. [[Bengali Hindus]] are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10\u201312 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. There are an estimated 400,000 [[Bengali Christians]] and 500,000 [[Bengali Buddhists]].\n\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.\n\n===Non-Bengali Muslims===\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali [[Muslim]] immigrants from different parts of [[South Asia]].

It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several [[indigenous people|indigenous]] ethnic groups in the three hill districts of [[Rangamati]], [[Bandarban]] and [[Khagrachari]]. The three largest communities in the region have a [[Raja]] as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\n* The [[Chakma people]] are the largest tribe of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the second largest indigenous ethnic group of Bangladesh after Bengalis.

The individual [[nuclear family]] often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (''ghor''). Above the ''bari'' level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.<ref name=rs>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Rural Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (''shomaj'' or ''milat''). Among the functions of a ''shomaj'' might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a [[mullah]]. An informal council of ''shomaj'' elders (''matabdars'' or ''shordars'') settles village disputes. Factional competition between the ''motobdars'' is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.<ref name=rs/>\n\nGroups of homes in a village are called ''Paras'', and each ''para'' has its own name. Several ''paras'' constitute a ''mauza'', the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common [[thatched]] [[bamboo]] huts.<ref name=rs/>\n\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\n\n==Urban society==\n[[File:Dhaka Skyline at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|View of downtown [[Dhaka]], the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities]]\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> [[Dhaka]] is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous [[megacities]]. Other important cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Jessore]], [[Barisal]], [[Comilla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Mymensingh]]. Most urban centers are rural administrative [[town]]s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of [[upazila]]s.<ref name=us>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Urban Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\n==Identity==\nBangladesh is noted for [[cultural pluralism]] within a [[Bengali Muslim]] majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The [[Bengali language]] is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced [[socialism]] under a secular parliamentary system. [[Military coups in Bangladesh|Military coups]] ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the [[free market]] and promoted moderate [[Islamism]]. In 1988, [[Islam]] was made the [[state religion]]. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of [[Secularity|separation of mosque and state]] in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=BANGLADESH|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=United States Department of State|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace treaty]] in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect [[adivasi]] land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of ''Bangalee'' as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Bangladesh}}\nCulture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religions are Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism,  which have played a critical part in influencing the country's culture.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Wikipedia in Bangla.svg|thumb|The word ''Wikipedia'' written in the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]]]\nThe official language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. [[Bengali dialects]] vary between different regions of Bangladesh.\n\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at [[Mahasthangarh]] and is written in the [[Brahmi script]]. The language is [[Magadhi Prakrit]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mahasthan_Brahmi_Inscription |title = Mahasthan Brahmi Inscription - Banglapedia}}</ref> The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from [[Apabhramsa]], between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]], but later became distinct. It became an official language of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by the number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. The language was modernized during the [[Bengali Renaissance]] in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], Assamese, Odia and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]]s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\n\nThe [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\n\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Marma language|Marma]], Chakma and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bisnupriya Manipuri]].\n\n=== Surnames ===\n{{Main|Bengali name}}\nBangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bangladeshis]]\n* [[Bangladeshi diaspora]]\n* [[Demographics of Bangladesh]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Bangladesh topics}}\n{{Bangladeshi diaspora}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Bangladesh| ]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi people| ]]\n", "name_user": "Shimu25", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChanges Bengali language to Bangla language", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshis"}

Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and [[politically incorrect]] content. Under Szalwinski's ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the [[dot-com bubble]], the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand, followed by closure of the stores.<ref name=\"Rob\" />\n\nThe British edition of ''Vice'' was launched in 2002 and [[Andy Capper]] was its first editor.

Both ''Vice''{{'}}s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and [[pop culture|pop cultural]] matters to covering more serious news topics. Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication, ''Vice''{{'}}s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory. Articles on the site feature a range of subjects, often things not covered as by mainstream media. The magazine's editors have championed the [[Immersion journalism|immersionist school of journalism]], which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show [[Balls Deep (TV Series)|''Balls Deep'']] on the [[Viceland]] Channel. This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets, and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos. Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of [[Iraqi people]],<ref name=\"iraqissue\"/> [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],<ref name=\"nativeissue\"/> [[Russian people]],<ref name=\"ru\"/> people with [[mental disorders]],<ref name=\"ill\"/> and people with [[mental disabilities]].<ref name=\"special\"/> ''Vice'' also publishes an annual guide for students in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"student\"/>\n\nIn 2007, a ''Vice'' announcement was published on the Internet: <blockquote>After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month, we started to get bored with it.

The intention of the founders was to provide work and a community service.<ref name=gua/> When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Alix Laurent, they bought him out and changed the name to ''Vice'' in 1996.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nRichard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late 1990s. Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and [[politically incorrect]] content. Under Szalwinski's ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the [[dot-com bubble]], the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand, followed by closure of the stores.<ref name=\"Rob\" />\n\nThe British edition of ''Vice'' was launched in 2002 and [[Andy Capper]] was its first editor. Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication's remit was to cover \"the things we're meant to be ashamed of\", and articles were published on topics such as [[bukkake]] and bodily functions.<ref name=\"Pug\">{{cite web|author1=Andrew Pugh|title='Maybe we've grown up': Ten years on, how ''Vice'' magazine got serious|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/\u2018maybe-we\u2019ve-grown-up\u2019-ten-years-how-vice-magazine-got-serious|website=Press Gazette|publisher=Progressive Media International|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 2007, 13 foreign editions of ''Vice'' magazine were published, the Vice independent record label was functional, and the online video channel VBS.com had 184,000 unique viewers from the U.S. during the month of August. The media company was still based in New York City, but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious, such as armed conflict in Iraq, than previous content. Alvi explained to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 2007: \"The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village.\"<ref name=\"Rob\" />\n\nMcInnes left the publication in 2008, citing \"creative differences\" as the primary issue.

Both ''Vice''{{'}}s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and [[pop culture|pop cultural]] matters to covering more serious news topics. Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication, ''Vice''{{'}}s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory. Articles on the site feature a range of subjects, often things not covered as by mainstream media. The magazine's editors have championed the [[Immersion journalism|immersionist school of journalism]], which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show [[Balls Deep (TV Series)|''Balls Deep'']] on the [[Viceland]] Channel. This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets, and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos. Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of [[Iraqi people]],<ref name=\"iraqissue\"/> [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],<ref name=\"nativeissue\"/> [[Russian people]],<ref name=\"ru\"/> people with [[mental disorders]],<ref name=\"ill\"/> and people with [[mental disabilities]].<ref name=\"special\"/> ''Vice'' also publishes an annual guide for students in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"student\"/>\n\nIn 2007, a ''Vice'' announcement was published on the Internet: <blockquote>After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month, we started to get bored with it. Besides, too many other magazines have ripped it and started doing their own lame take on themes.
