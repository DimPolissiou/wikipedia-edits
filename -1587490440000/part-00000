There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance.

Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837.

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.

The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The Story of Telecommunications, 1992. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[David Edward Hughes]] invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

It was formed from successive mergers including: \n*The Falmouth, Malta, Gibraltar Telegraph Company\n*The British Indian Submarine Telegraph Company\n*The Marseilles, Algiers and Malta Telegraph Company\n*The Eastern Telegraph Company<ref>[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/CandW/Eastern/ Evolution of Eastern Telegraph Company]</ref>\n*The Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company\n*The Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies<ref>[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/CandW/EATC/ Origins of the Eastern & Associated Telegraph Companies]</ref>\n\n==Telegraphy in war==\nThe ability to send telegrams brought obvious advantages to those conducting war. Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance.

Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.

The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.

He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further. The film finishes on a literal [[cliffhanger]] with Croker announcing:  \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Mark |title=Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!\u2019 Brexit, crisis management and sensemaking |url=http://theconversation.com/hang-on-a-minute-lads-ive-got-a-great-idea-brexit-crisis-management-and-sensemaking-94433 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}} <!-- Please check that any new links are correct or satisfy [[WP:REDLINK]] -->\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Michael Caine]] as Charlie Croker\n*[[No\u00ebl Coward]] as Mr. Bridger\n*[[Benny Hill]] as Professor Simon Peach\n*[[Raf Vallone]] as Altabani\n*[[Tony Beckley]] as Camp Freddie\n*[[Rossano Brazzi]] as Roger Beckermann\n*[[Maggie Blye]] as Lorna\n*[[Irene Handl]] as Miss Peach\n*[[John Le Mesurier]] as the Prison Governor\n*[[Fred Emney]] as Birkinshaw\n*[[John Clive]] as Garage manager\n*[[Graham Payn]] as Keats\n*[[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]] as Arthur\n*[[Stanley Caine]] as Coco\n*[[Barry Cox (actor)|Barry Cox]] as Chris <!-- NOT the [[Barry Cox]] (born 1977) -->\n*[[Harry Baird (actor)|Harry Baird]] as Big William\n*[[George Innes]] as Bill Bailey\n*[[John Forgeham]] as Frank\n*[[Robert Powell]] as Yellow\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Derek Ware (actor)|Derek Ware]] as Rozzer\n*[[Frank Jarvis (actor)|Frank Jarvis]] as Roger\n*[[David Salamone]] as Dominic\n*[[Richard Essame]] as Tony\n*[[Mario Valgoi]] as Manzo\n*[[Renato Romano]]<sup>([[:it:Renato Romano|in Italian]])</sup> as Cosca\n*[[Franco Norvelli]] as Altabani's driver\n*[[Robert Rietti]] as Police chief\n*[[Timothy Bateson]] as Dentist\n*[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Vicar\n*[[Arnold Diamond]] as Senior computer room official\n*[[Simon Dee]] as Shirtmaker\n*[[Alistair Hunter]] as Warder (cinema)\n*[[Lana Gatto]] as Mrs. Cosca\n*John Morris as Standin <!-- NOT the [[John Morris (actor)]] (born 1984) -->\n*[[Louis Mansi]] as Computer room official\n*[[Henry McGee]] as Tailor\n*[[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mrs Beckermann\n*[[Valerie Leon]] as Hotel Receptionist\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[No\u00ebl Coward]], who played Bridger, was godfather of the director, Peter Collinson.

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] can be seen in the background. The meeting at the misty funeral was filmed in [[Cruagh]] Cemetery, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains.

Lamborghini confirmed in May 2019 that the Italian Job Miura had been confirmed as chassis number 3586.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/classic-cars/italian-jobs-lost-lamborghini-miura-found/|title=The Italian Job's lost Lamborghini Miura has been found|date=2019-05-08|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the director's commentary on the DVD, despite the publicity the film would give to the Mini, the car's maker, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], only provided a token fleet of Minis and the production company had to buy the rest at trade price. [[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger.

After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 83% and an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 27 reviews.

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. The film was also the subject of a play, ''Bill Shakespeare's \"The Italian Job\"'', written by Malachi Bogdanov, who used lines from Shakespeare plays to tell the story.

He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors.

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] can be seen in the background. The meeting at the misty funeral was filmed in [[Cruagh]] Cemetery, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. The [[office block]] that doubled as the Turin traffic control centre was Apex House, the [[Hanworth]], [[Middlesex]] head office of the television rental chain [[Radio Rentals|DER]].<ref name = \"makingof\" />\n\n[[File:1960 Morris Mini - The Italian Job - Coventry Transport Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A display of a Mini emerging from a sewer tunnel in [[Coventry Transport Museum]]]]\n\nThe chase sequences were filmed in Turin, except for the chase through the sewer tunnel, which was shot in the [[River Sowe|Sowe]] Valley Sewer Duplication system in the [[Stoke Aldermoor]] district of [[Coventry]] in the English Midlands, filmed from the back of a [[Mini Moke]].<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The person on the far side who closes the gate at the end of sewer tunnel is the director, Peter Collinson.

The weir the Minis cross in the car chase is just down river from the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele I at the end of [[Po (river)|Via Po]] in central Turin.\n\nA portion of the car chase was filmed as a dance between the Minis and police cars with a full orchestra playing \"[[The Blue Danube]]\" inside [[Pier Luigi Nervi]]'s Palazzo Esposizioni usually used for the Turin Motor Show (now the hospital library).<ref name = \"makingof\" /> It was cut from the final version and appears as an extra on the [[DVD]].\n\nThe final escape from Turin was filmed on the road to [[Ceresole Reale]] via [[Lago Agnel]] and [[Nivolet Pass]] (the highway does not lead to France or Switzerland because it is a dead end). The bus was left hanging off this corner<ref>https://goo.gl/maps/sNCidc999BQ2</ref> in the climactic ending.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:The Italian Job - geograph.org.uk - 953936.jpg|thumb|right|Minis on display at Bardney Heritage Centre]]\nRoger Beckermann's orange [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the opening scene is actually two cars. The first was a Miura P400 that was sold as new afterwards. In 2015 it was unearthed and authenticated by Iain Tyrrell, one of the world's foremost classic car experts and Lamborghini aficionado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | title = iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | accessdate = 8 Jan 2018}}</ref> The second car, tumbled down the chasm by the Mafia bulldozer, was another Miura that had previously been in a serious accident and was not roadworthy.

[[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger. Since a 1968 Mini only weighs 630&nbsp;kg (1400&nbsp;lb),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Chris|title=Complete Classic Mini 1959\u20132000|isbn=9781899870608|year=2003|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon}}</ref> each of these vehicles would have had to carry 1\u00bd times its own weight in gold.\n\nThe coach at the end of the film was a 1964 [[Bedford VAL]] with [[Harrington Legionnaire]] Body, distinctive for its twin front steering axles. After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 83% and an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 27 reviews.

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. The film was also the subject of a play, ''Bill Shakespeare's \"The Italian Job\"'', written by Malachi Bogdanov, who used lines from Shakespeare plays to tell the story.

Their last names Brescia and Cafferata gave rise to the Breca brand, which collects the memory of its founders. \n\nSince September [[2011]], its main companies are grouped in Inversiones Breca S. A. holding company, which has as shareholders Ana Mar\u00eda Brescia Cafferata, RBCF Inversiones, Pedro Brescia Moreyra, Mario Brescia Moreyra, Fortunato Brescia Moreyra and a RBCF trust. The Fort Brescia family is a shareholder in RBCF company.<ref>http://www.gatoencerrado.net/store/noticias/62/62510/detalle.htm Inversiones Breca SA</ref> \n\n\n==History==\nFortunato Brescia Tassano began his working life as an assistant to a retail store.\nIn [[1913]] he acquired the Miranaves ranch, next to the Port of [[Callao]], and began his own business in order to produce subsistence farming and dairy products and to become the supplier of the warehouses. A couple of years later, he bought the Limatambo ranch, which includes part of the current districts of San Borja, San Isidro and Miraflores.\n\nIn [[1919]] Mr. Fortunato married Mar\u00eda Cafferata Pe\u00f1aranda and gave rise to a family decided to invest in Peru. In [[1928]] the Government of Augusto B. Legu\u00eda expropriated part of the Miranaves ranch to build warehouses and residences for workers of the Port of Callao. In [[1940]] during the Government of Manuel Prado Ugarteche, it was also expropriated part of the Limatambo ranch to build an airport in Lima. In [[1946]] despite the expropriation, the opportunities in the real estate market led to Mr. Fortunato to create the company Urbanizadora Jard\u00edn. In [[1948]] Mr. Fortunato developed his first real estate project: The Santa Marina residential area, in Callao. <ref name=\"forbesperuvianbillionairebanker\">{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Kerry A.|title=Peruvian Billionaire Banker And Industrialist Mario Brescia Dies|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2013/05/17/peruvian-billionaire-banker-and-industrialist-mario-brescia-dies/#5333dd947a0a|accessdate=December 25, 2017|work=Forbes|date=May 17, 2013}}</ref>\nIn [[1952]] Mr. Fortunato passed away and his sons Pedro and Mario were left in charge of the businesses with the support and cIn ontinued involvement of their sisters Rosa and Ana Mar\u00eda.

Their sisters Ana Mar\u00eda and Rosa were, at that time, 27 and 25 years, respectively, and although they were considered in the big decisions (by Pedro's mandate, everything was decided by consensus), they never got involved in the day to day business. Pedro and Mario decided to give strength to the real estate business, which is reflected in the title of the thesis made by Pedro: \u201cHow to lot a ranch for residential use?\" This was focused on the lotting of the San Borja ranch.\n\nDespite of the push made in the real estate business, the brothers sought new opportunities and investment. They were admitted in the fishing business by acquiring the companies Tecnol\u00f3gica de Alimentos, [[Costa Mar]] and [[Indo Mar]]. In addition, their diversification led them to develop the mining business, so they took advantage of the quarries they inherited from their maternal grandfather, but his father Mr. Fortunato decided to close. They decided to reopen them, acquiring some new ones and creating [[Corporaci\u00f3n Minera Patar\u00e1.]] <ref>[https://elpais.com/economia/2016/07/21/actualidad/1469101820_912034.html]</ref>\n\nIn [[1963]], Pedro launched the San Borja residential area on part of the grounds of his ranch, and shortly after it would follow the Monterrico residential area. Both are today residential areas of modern [[Lima]]. In [[1964]], AESA was created, the first firm that would be in charge of the group's businesses, and the next year it entered into the R\u00edmac shareholding, an important leap in its plan to diversify the group and learn from other entrepreneurs.\n\nWhen everything seemed to be going well, the political power touched the group business. In [[1968]], the Military Government of General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] passed the Agrarian Reform Law that snatched their agricultural lands in the valleys of Supe, [[Huaura]], [[Chincha]], and the urban land expansion territories in the basins of the Surco and Ate rivers. However, their lands in south Limatambo, Valverde and Naranjal were not touched. In [[1973]], the Government decided, in addition, to nationalize the fishing activity and took control of Tecnol\u00f3gica de Alimentos, which by that time already had a share of 4 % of the fishing activity in [[Peru]].\n\nThis nationalization policy of the economy, although it meant financial loss for the nascent Brescia group, it also opened the door to new opportunities, since the Government had ordered that the industry, mining, banking and insurance, traditionally dominated by foreign capital, must necessarily have local partners. The foreign capital, on the other hand, could not have more than 20 % of the shareholding in the companies dedicated to those sectors.\n\nIn this position, when foreign investors were forced to reduce their participation, the Brescia group acquired 4 % of the [[Banco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa]] company and 27 % of the Banco de Lima company. In [[1977]], they would perform a similar operation and achieved a major participation in the Minsur mining company. In parallel, they dabbled in the tourism sector when acquiring the hotels manager Intursa company. By the end of the seventies decade, the Brescia group acquired the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Peruana de Pinturas (CPP) and the fabric factory [[La Uni\u00f3n]].\n\n==Present==\nAfter the death of the founder [[Fortunato Brescia Tassano]], in [[1952]], the leadership of the group was in the hands of his eldest son, [[Pedro Brescia Cafferata]], with the support of his brother Mario. The two daughters of the patriarch, Rosa and Ana Mar\u00eda, although with a much lower profile, also participated in making decisions. Pedro and Mario took the reins until they reached old ages and after their retirement (Mario passed away in [[2013]] and Pedro, who had retired a few years earlier, in 2014), the management was left in the hands of the third generation of the family. Although the family tradition dictated that Pedro leaves the management to his eldest son, he had no offspring, so a process of transfer and development of family protocols began. Consequently, the current management of the group is in charge of a steering committee made up of four members of the third generation, who act by consensus and maintain the tradition of the founders.\"<ref name=\"forbesprofile\">{{cite web|title=Rosa Brescia Cafferata|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/rosa-brescia-cafferata/|website=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}</ref> One of its subsidiaries, Tecnologica de Alimentos (TASA), is \"one of the largest producers of fish meal in the world.\"<ref name=\"forbesprofileanamaria\">{{cite web|title=Ana Maria Brescia Cafferata|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ana-maria-brescia-cafferata/|website=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Relevant companies ==\n=== BBVA Per\u00fa ===\nBBVA Continental is the second largest bank in [[Peru]], with a network of 320 branches in the country.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'' does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of ''Memoriale Domini'' in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. However, recent statements and practices of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]<ref name=\"light of the world\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|title=In 'Light of the World', by Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict says: \"I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself...The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point.\"|website=ignatius.com|access-date=2012-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055319/http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> have caused a shift in Catholic practice (notably at Papal Masses and amongst more traditional-minded Catholics) of receiving on the tongue while kneeling, which is also an ancient practice. (This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still common in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''\"Deggendorfer Gnad\"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of St. Gudula]] and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the Cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town's Jewish population (see [[Brussels massacre]]). In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].\n\nAn alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0972723706 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[R\u00f6ttingen]], near [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. P\u00f6lten]]; 1330, at [[G\u00fcstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).<ref>{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|287px|The second panel of [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Miracle of the Profaned Host'' (c.1467-1469) from the Urbino Confraternity of Corpus Domini predella.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'' does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of ''Memoriale Domini'' in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. However, recent statements and practices of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]<ref name=\"light of the world\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|title=In 'Light of the World', by Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict says: \"I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself...The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point.\"|website=ignatius.com|access-date=2012-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055319/http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> have caused a shift in Catholic practice (notably at Papal Masses and amongst more traditional-minded Catholics) of receiving on the tongue while kneeling, which is also an ancient practice. (This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still common in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''\"Deggendorfer Gnad\"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of St. Gudula]] and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the Cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town's Jewish population (see [[Brussels massacre]]). In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].\n\nAn alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0972723706 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[R\u00f6ttingen]], near [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. P\u00f6lten]]; 1330, at [[G\u00fcstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).<ref>{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|287px|The second panel of [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Miracle of the Profaned Host'' (c.1467-1469) from the Urbino Confraternity of Corpus Domini predella.

It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:<ref name=\"mth\"/>\n\n# The traditional society\n# The preconditions for take-off\n# The take-off\n# The drive to maturity\n# The age of high mass-consumption\n\nRostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the \"[[backwardness]]\" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.\n\nRostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the \"initial\" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn addition to the five stages he had proposed in ''The Stages of Economic Growth'' in 1960, Rostow discussed the sixth stage beyond high mass-consumption and called it \"the search for quality\" in 1971.<ref name=\"Politics\"/> Below is an outline of Rostow's six stages of growth:\n\n# '''The traditional society'''\n#* characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a \"[[Primary sector of the economy|primary]]\" sector economy\n#* limited technology\n#* Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively \n#* This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth\n#* No centralized nations or political systems.\n# '''The preconditions for take-off'''\n#* External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.\n#* Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.\n#* Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)\n#* Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies\n#* Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux\n#* Individual social mobility begins\n#* Development of national identity and shared economic interests.\n# '''The take-off'''\n#* Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.\n#* \"[[Secondary sector of the economy|Secondary]]\" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.\n#* Textiles and apparel are usually the first \"take-off\" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic \"[[Industrial Revolution]]\"\n#* An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.\n# '''The drive to maturity'''\n#* Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly\n#* Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption\n#* Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.\n#* Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)\n# '''The age of mass-consumption'''\n#* the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in the economy and society\n#* widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)\n#* consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods\n#* Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)\n# '''Beyond consumption (The search for quality)'''\n#* age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods\n#* large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption \n#* a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth\n\nRostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing:\n\n<blockquote>\"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?\"<ref name=\"WWR\" /><ref name=\"MP\" /></blockquote>\n\nRostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.<ref>Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that \"the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also\u2014and equally\u2014the uniqueness of each nation's experience.\"</ref>\n\n== Theoretical Framework ==\n\nRostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get \"locked in\", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n== Stages of Development Process ==\n\n=== The traditional society ===\n\nAn economy in this stage has a limited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}</ref> States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production. Countries in this stage could include Ghana and Togo.\n\nWars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a \"backward\" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.\n\nIn settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission. This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..\n\n=== The preconditions for take-off ===\n\nIn the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.<ref name=\"MP\"/> This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).\n\nThere are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\nThe strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.\n\nSocial overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.\n\nAll these changes effectively prepare the way for \"take-off\" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.\nAccording to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which \"set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}</ref> The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"rd\"/> \n\nReferring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of \"Pre Take-off\" till \"Drive to Maturity:\" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the \"Take-off\" stage and far beyond.\n\n=== The take-off ===\n\nThis stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.<ref name=\"MP\"/><ref name=\"rd\"/> Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's \"second nature\" and a shared goal.<ref name=\"mth\"/> In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term \"transition\", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.\n\nPer Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:<blockquote>1.

While there are other examples of \"Take-off\" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based \"take-off\"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.<ref name=\"MP\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}</ref> This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.<ref name=\"mth\"/>\n\n[[File:Table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates<ref name=\"WWR\" />]]\n\nThe take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of \"delayed gratification\", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.\n\nThe ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:\n*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.\n*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.\n*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.\n*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.\n\nAn example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.\n\nIn the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.\n\n=== The drive to maturity ===\n\nAfter take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it \"as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources.\"<ref name=\"WWR\" /><ref name=\"MP\" /> Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.\n\n[[File:Table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates<ref name=\"WWR\" />]]\nOn comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.\n\nThe structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:\n* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.\n* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced\n* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.\nDuring this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.\n\nA prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.\n\nThis diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\n=== The age of high mass-consumption ===\n\nThe age of high mass-consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded by many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass-consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\nHistorically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.<ref name=\"MP\"/>\n\n=== Beyond consumption (The search for quality) ===\n\nWhen proposed, this step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.<ref name=\":0\">Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.</ref> Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.<ref name=\":0\" /> New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.<ref name=\":0\" /> With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis stage was later discussed in Rostow's book ''Politics and the Stages of Growth'' published in 1971, in which he called the stage \"the search for quality\".<ref name=\"Politics\"/>\n\n== Criticism of the model ==\n\n# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.\n# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.\n# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass-consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.\n# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.\n# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.\n# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic, there is always a need for a push.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201317 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}</ref>\n\n'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the \"era of high mass-consumption.\" The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAnother assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass-consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].\n\nAnother criticism of Rostow's work is that it considers large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass-consumption is nigh. This does leave a potential \"grim meathook future\" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.<ref>\"Grim Meathook Future\" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 }} .</ref> (See [[Dependency theory]])\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Development economics]]\n*[[Ragnar Nurkse]]\n*[[Virtuous circle and vicious circle]]\n*[[Strategy of unbalanced growth]]\n*[[Low-level equilibrium trap]]\n*[[Dual economy]]\n*[[Big Push Model]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n* <ref name=mth>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |first=W.

It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:<ref name=\"mth\"/>\n\n# The traditional society\n# The preconditions for take-off\n# The take-off\n# The drive to maturity\n# The age of high mass-consumption\n\nRostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the \"[[backwardness]]\" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.\n\nRostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the \"initial\" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn addition to the five stages he had proposed in ''The Stages of Economic Growth'' in 1960, Rostow discussed the sixth stage beyond high mass-consumption and called it \"the search for quality\" in 1971.<ref name=\"Politics\"/> Below is an outline of Rostow's six stages of growth:\n\n# '''The traditional society'''\n#* characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a \"[[Primary sector of the economy|primary]]\" sector economy\n#* limited technology\n#* Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively \n#* This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth\n#* No centralized nations or political systems.\n# '''The preconditions for take-off'''\n#* External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.\n#* Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.\n#* Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)\n#* Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies\n#* Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux\n#* Individual social mobility begins\n#* Development of national identity and shared economic interests.\n# '''The take-off'''\n#* Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.\n#* \"[[Secondary sector of the economy|Secondary]]\" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.\n#* Textiles and apparel are usually the first \"take-off\" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic \"[[Industrial Revolution]]\"\n#* An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.\n# '''The drive to maturity'''\n#* Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly\n#* Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption\n#* Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.\n#* Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)\n# '''The age of mass-consumption'''\n#* the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in the economy and society\n#* widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)\n#* consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods\n#* Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)\n# '''Beyond consumption (The search for quality)'''\n#* age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods\n#* large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption \n#* a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth\n\nRostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing:\n\n<blockquote>\"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?\"<ref name=\"WWR\" /><ref name=\"MP\" /></blockquote>\n\nRostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.<ref>Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that \"the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also\u2014and equally\u2014the uniqueness of each nation's experience.\"</ref>\n\n== Theoretical Framework ==\n\nRostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get \"locked in\", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n== Stages of Development Process ==\n\n=== The traditional society ===\n\nAn economy in this stage has a limited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}</ref> States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production. Countries in this stage could include Ghana and Togo.\n\nWars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a \"backward\" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.\n\nIn settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission. This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..\n\n=== The preconditions for take-off ===\n\nIn the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.<ref name=\"MP\"/> This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).\n\nThere are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\nThe strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.\n\nSocial overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.\n\nAll these changes effectively prepare the way for \"take-off\" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.\nAccording to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which \"set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}</ref> The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"rd\"/> \n\nReferring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of \"Pre Take-off\" till \"Drive to Maturity:\" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the \"Take-off\" stage and far beyond.\n\n=== The take-off ===\n\nThis stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.<ref name=\"MP\"/><ref name=\"rd\"/> Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's \"second nature\" and a shared goal.<ref name=\"mth\"/> In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term \"transition\", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.\n\nPer Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:<blockquote>1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product</blockquote><blockquote>2. The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;</blockquote><blockquote>3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off.<ref name=\"WWR\" /> </blockquote>The third requirement implies that the needed capital must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption. Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.  Rostow says that this transition does not follow a set trend as there are a variety of different motivations or stimulus which began this growth process.\nTake off requires a large and sufficient amount of loanable funds for expansion of the industrial sector which generally come from two sources which are:\n#Shifts in income flows by way of taxation, implementation of land reforms and various other fiscal measures.\n#Re-investment of profits earned from foreign trade as has been observed in many East Asian countries.  While there are other examples of \"Take-off\" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based \"take-off\"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.<ref name=\"MP\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}</ref> This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.<ref name=\"mth\"/>\n\n[[File:Table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates<ref name=\"WWR\" />]]\n\nThe take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of \"delayed gratification\", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.\n\nThe ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:\n*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.\n*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.\n*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.\n*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.\n\nAn example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.\n\nIn the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.\n\n=== The drive to maturity ===\n\nAfter take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it \"as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources.\"<ref name=\"WWR\" /><ref name=\"MP\" /> Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.\n\n[[File:Table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates<ref name=\"WWR\" />]]\nOn comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.\n\nThe structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:\n* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.\n* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced\n* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.\nDuring this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.\n\nA prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.\n\nThis diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\n=== The age of high mass-consumption ===\n\nThe age of high mass-consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded by many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass-consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\nHistorically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.<ref name=\"MP\"/>\n\n=== Beyond consumption (The search for quality) ===\n\nWhen proposed, this step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.<ref name=\":0\">Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.</ref> Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.<ref name=\":0\" /> New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.<ref name=\":0\" /> With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis stage was later discussed in Rostow's book ''Politics and the Stages of Growth'' published in 1971, in which he called the stage \"the search for quality\".<ref name=\"Politics\"/>\n\n== Criticism of the model ==\n\n# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.\n# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.\n# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass-consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.\n# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.\n# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.\n# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic there is need for push always.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201317 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}</ref>\n\n'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the \"era of high mass-consumption.\" The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAnother assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass-consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].\n\nAnother criticism of Rostow's work is that it considers large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass-consumption is nigh. This does leave a potential \"grim meathook future\" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.<ref>\"Grim Meathook Future\" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 }} .</ref> (See [[Dependency theory]])\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Development economics]]\n*[[Ragnar Nurkse]]\n*[[Virtuous circle and vicious circle]]\n*[[Strategy of unbalanced growth]]\n*[[Low-level equilibrium trap]]\n*[[Dual economy]]\n*[[Big Push Model]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n* <ref name=mth>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |first=W.
