{"title_page": "History of international law", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\nThe '''history of international law''' examines the evolution and development of public international law in both state practice and conceptual understanding. Modern international law developed out of Renaissance Europe and is strongly entwined with the development of western political organisation at that time. The development of European notions of sovereignty and nation states would necessitate the development of methods for interstate relations and standards of behaviour, and these would lay the foundations of what would become international law. However, while the origins of the modern system of international law can be traced back 400 years, the development of the concepts and practises that would underpin that system can be traced back to ancient historical politics and relationships thousands of years old. Important concepts are derived from the practice between Greek [[city-states]] and the [[Roman law]] concept of [[ius gentium]] (which regulated contacts between Roman citizens and non-Roman people).  These principles were not universal however.  In East Asia, political theory was based not on the equality of states, but rather the cosmological supremacy of the [[Emperor of China]].\n\n== Early history ==\nBasic concepts of international law such as [[treaties]] can be traced back thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bederman|first=David J.|title=International law in antiquity|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

In peace and in war, an inter-state culture evolved that prescribed certain rules for how these states would interact.  These rules did not apply to interactions with non-Greek states, but among themselves the Greek inter-state community resembled in some respects the modern international community.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] did not develop an international law, as it acted without regard to any external rules in its dealings with those territories that were not already part of the empire.  The Romans did, however, form municipal laws governing the interactions between private Roman citizens and foreigners.  These laws, called the ''jus gentium'' (as opposed to the ''jus civile'' governing interactions between citizens) codified some ideas of basic fairness, and attributed some rules to an objective, independent \"[[natural law]].\"  These ''jus gentium'' ideas of fairness and natural law have survived and are reflected in modern international law.\n\nEarly [[Islamic law]]'s principles concerning [[Islamic military jurisprudence|military conduct]] and the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] under the early [[Caliphate]] are considered precursors to [[international humanitarian law]]. The many requirements on how prisoners of war should be treated included, for example, providing shelter, food and clothing, respecting their cultures, and preventing any acts of execution, rape or revenge. Some of these principles were not codified in Western [[international law]] until modern times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Malekian |first1=Farhad |title=Principles of Islamic International Criminal Law: A Comparative Search |date=2011 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] |isbn=9789004203969 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPNamMveFVMC&pg=PA335}}</ref> Islamic law under the early Caliphate institutionalised humanitarian limitations on military conduct, including attempts to limit the severity of war, guidelines for ceasing hostilities, distinguishing between civilians and combatants, preventing unnecessary destruction, and caring for the sick and wounded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saeed |first1=Abdullah |title=Human Rights and Islam: An Introduction to Key Debates between Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law |date=2018 |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |isbn=9781784716585 |page=299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ChWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT299}}</ref>\n\n== Nation-states ==\nAfter the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] and the [[collapse of the Holy Roman Empire]] into independent cities, principalities, kingdoms and nations, for the first time there was a real need for rules of conduct between a large international community.  Without an empire or a dominant religious leadership to moderate and direct international dealings, most of Europe looked to [[Justinian's code of law]] from the Roman Empire, and the [[canon law of the Catholic Church]] for inspiration.\n\nInternational trade was the real catalyst for the development of objective rules of behaviour between states.  Without a code of conduct, there was little to guarantee trade or protect the merchants of one state from the actions of another.  Economic self-interest drove the evolution of common international trade rules, and most importantly the rules and customs of [[maritime law]].\n\nAs international trade, exploration and warfare became more involved and complex, the need for common international customs and practices became even more important.  The [[Hanseatic League]] of the more than 150 entities in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states developed many useful international customs, which facilitated trade and communication among other things.  The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals.  Treaties\u2014agreements between governments intended to be binding\u2014became a useful tool to protect commerce.  The horrors of the [[Thirty Years' War]], meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities.\n\n== Hugo Grotius ==\n{{main|Hugo Grotius}}\nInternational practices, customs, rules and treaties proliferated to the point of complexity.  Several scholars sought to compile them all into organized treatises.  The most important of these was [[Hugo Grotius]], whose treatise ''[[De Jure Belli Ac Pacis Libri Tres]]'' is considered the starting point for modern international law. Before [[Hugo Grotius]], most European thinkers treated law as something independent of mankind, with its own existence.  Some laws were invented by men, but ultimately they reflected the essential natural law.  Grotius was no different, except in one important respect:  Unlike the earlier thinkers, who believed that the natural law was imposed by a deity, Grotius believed that the natural law came from an essential universal reason, common to all men.\n\nThis [[rationalist]] perspective enabled Grotius to posit several rational principles underlying law.  Law was not imposed from above, but rather derived from principles.  Foundation principles included the axioms that promises must be kept, and that harming another requires restitution.  These two principles have served as the basis for much of subsequent international law.  Apart from natural-law principles, Grotius also dealt with international custom, or voluntary law.  Grotius emphasized the importance of actual practices, customs and treaties\u2014what \"is\" done\u2014as opposed to normative rules of what \"ought to be\" done. This [[positivist]] approach to international law strengthened over time.  As nations became the predominant form of state in Europe, and their man-made laws became more important than religious doctrines and philosophies, the law of what \"is\" similarly became more important than the law of what \"ought to be.\"\n\n== Treaty of Westphalia ==\n{{main|Treaty of Westphalia}}\nThe Westphalian treaties of 1648 were a turning point in establishing the principle of [[state sovereignty]] as a cornerstone of the international order.  However the first attempts at formulating autonomous theories of international law occurred before this, in Spain, in the 16th century.  Most prominent among the early theorizers were the Roman Catholic theologians [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]]. Su\u00e1rez is especially notable in this regard in that he distinguished between [[ius inter gentes]] and [[ius intra gentes]] which he derived from ius gentium (the rights of peoples).  Ius inter gentes corresponds to modern international law. In 1625, [[Hugo Grotius]] followed with the first systematic treatise on international law, ''[[de iure belli ac pacis]]'', which dealt with the laws of war and peace. One important aspect of Grotius's treatment of international law is that he no longer bases it exclusively upon [[natural law]], but also accepts that states among themselves can also create binding rules of law (ius voluntarium).\n\nStill, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea of natural law as a basis for international law remained influential, and were further expressed in the works of [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Yet, in the second half of the 18th century, a shift occurs towards positivism in international law.  In addition, the idea of international law as a means for maintaining international peace is challenged due to the increasing tensions between the European great powers (France, [[Prussia]], [[Great-Britain]], Russia and [[Austria]]).  This tension between legal norms and political imperatives is well reflected in the century's most important treatise on international law, [[Emer de Vattel]]'s ''[[Du Droit des Gens]]'' (1758).  At the end of the century, [[Immanuel Kant]] believes that international law as a law that can justify war does not serve the purpose of peace anymore, and therefore argues in ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' (''Zum Ewigen Frieden'', 1795) and the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (''Metaphysik der Sitten'', 1797) for creating a new kind of international law.\n\nAfter World War I, an attempt was made to establish such a new international law of peace, of which the [[League of Nations]] was considered to be one of the cornerstones, but this attempt failed.  The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (1945) in fact reflects the fact that the traditional notion of state sovereignty remains the key concept in the law of nations. However, as recent research has shown, ius contra bellum (the outlawry of war) has its roots in 19th legal and political discourse.<ref>Simon, Hendrik (2018). \"The Myth of Liberum Ius ad Bellum: Justifying War in 19th-Century Legal Theory and Political Practice\". EJIL. 29 (1): 113-136. https://doi.org/10.1093/ejil/chy009</ref>\n\nIn the historiography of international law, some German authors, most notably among them [[Wilhelm Grewe]] and Karl-Heinz Ziegler, have argued that several periods can be distinguished, such as the Spanish era (1494\u20131648), the French era (1648-1789/1815), the English era (1789/1815-1919) and the American era since 1919.  The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645\u201348), the treaties of [[Ryswick]] and [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] (1697/1714), [[Vienna]] (1814\u201315), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945).\n\n== The League of Nations ==\n{{main|League of Nations}}\nFollowing World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions.  The [[League of Nations]], established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used \"external aggression\" to invade or conquer other member states.  An international court was established, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war.  Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences.  International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs.  Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it.\n\n== The postwar era ==\nAfter World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re-attempted through another treaty organization, the [[United Nations]].\n\nThe postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law.  International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal.  Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter.  Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war.\n\nInternational law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war.  Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like.  Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned.  The rules are rarely disputed.  But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated.  This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights.\n\n== Modern customary international law ==\nAn important development in modern international law is the concept of \"consent.\"  Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule.  Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty.\n\nAn evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law.  Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the ''opinio juris'' of what states believe international law requires them to do.\n\nCustomary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it.  At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions.  As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them.  When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it.  Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting.  Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage.\n\nCustomary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty.  For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations.\n\n==Modern treaty law==\nTreaties are essentially contracts between countries.  They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound.  If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept.  So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously.\n\nModern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties.  The first step is signing the treaty.  Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement.  The second step is ratifying the treaty.  A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it.  This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion.  A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it.\n\nEach country ratifies treaties its own way.  The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree.  In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound.\n\nModern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].  This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it.  The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith.  This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking.  It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding \"preamble.\"\n\nIn the modern world, international law is contested for its inability to enforce its rulings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Arbitration#History]]\n* [[Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)]], providing an alternative account to the Eurocentric narrative above.\n* [[Consulate of the Sea]] international law, (13th century), written in [[Catalonia]]\n==Important experts==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;14th century\n* [[Bartolus of Saxoferrato]]\n* [[Baldus de Ubaldis]]\n* [[Johannes Andreae]]\n* [[Giovanni da Legnano]]\n\n;15th century\n* [[Martinus Garatus Laudensis]]\n\n;16th century\n* [[Balthasar de Ayala]]\n* [[Francisco de Vitoria]]\n* [[Jean Bodin]]\n* [[Pierino Belli]]\n\n;17th century\n* [[Francisco Suarez]]\n* [[Hugo Grotius]]\n* [[Alberico Gentili]]\n* [[Richard Zouche]]\n* [[Samuel Rachel]]\n* [[Samuel Pufendorf]]\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]\n* [[Wolfgang Textor]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n;18th century\n*[[Jean Dumont (publicist)|Jean Dumont]]\n*[[Charles-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Castel de Saint-Pierre|Abb\u00e9 de St.Pierre]]\n*[[Cornelis van Bynkershoek]]\n*[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]\n*[[Emerich de Vattel]]\n*[[Johann Jakob Moser]]\n*[[Georg Friedrich von Martens]]\n\n;19th century\n*[[Jeremy Bentham]]\n*[[Johann Kaspar Bluntschli|Johann Bluntschli]]\n*[[Henry Wheaton]]\n*[[Robert Phillimore]]\n*[[Henry Sumner Maine]]\n\n;20th century\n* [[William Howard Taft]]\n*[[L.

The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645\u201348), the treaties of [[Ryswick]] and [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] (1697/1714), [[Vienna]] (1814\u201315), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945).\n\n== The League of Nations ==\n{{main|League of Nations}}\nFollowing World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions.  The [[League of Nations]], established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used \"external aggression\" to invade or conquer other member states.  An international court was established, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war.  Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences.  International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs.  Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it.\n\n== The postwar era ==\nAfter World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re-attempted through another treaty organization, the [[United Nations]].\n\nThe postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law.  International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal.  Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter.  Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war.\n\nInternational law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war.  Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like.  Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned.  The rules are rarely disputed.  But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated.  This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights.\n\n== Modern customary international law ==\nAn important development in modern international law is the concept of \"consent.\"  Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule.  Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty.\n\nAn evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law.  Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the ''opinio juris'' of what states believe international law requires them to do.\n\nCustomary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it.  At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions.  As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them.  When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it.  Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting.  Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage.\n\nCustomary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty.  For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations.\n\n==Modern treaty law==\nTreaties are essentially contracts between countries.  They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound.  If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept.  So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously.\n\nModern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties.  The first step is signing the treaty.  Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement.  The second step is ratifying the treaty.  A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it.  This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion.  A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it.\n\nEach country ratifies treaties its own way.  The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree.  In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound.\n\nModern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].  This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it.  The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith.  This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking.  It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding \"preamble.\"\n\nIn the modern world, international law is contested for its inability to enforce its rulings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Arbitration#History]]\n* [[Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)]], providing an alternative account to the Eurocentric narrative above.\n* [[Consulate of the Sea]] international law, (13th century), written in [[Catalonia]]\n==Important experts==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;14th century\n* [[Bartolus of Saxoferrato]]\n* [[Baldus de Ubaldis]]\n* [[Johannes Andreae]]\n* [[Giovanni da Legnano]]\n\n;15th century\n* [[Martinus Garatus Laudensis]]\n\n;16th century\n* [[Balthasar de Ayala]]\n* [[Francisco de Vitoria]]\n* [[Jean Bodin]]\n* [[Pierino Belli]]\n\n;17th century\n* [[Francisco Suarez]]\n* [[Hugo Grotius]]\n* [[Alberico Gentili]]\n* [[Richard Zouche]]\n* [[Samuel Rachel]]\n* [[Samuel Pufendorf]]\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]\n* [[Wolfgang Textor]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n;18th century\n*[[Jean Dumont (publicist)|Jean Dumont]]\n*[[Charles-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Castel de Saint-Pierre|Abb\u00e9 de St.Pierre]]\n*[[Cornelis van Bynkershoek]]\n*[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]\n*[[Emerich de Vattel]]\n*[[Johann Jakob Moser]]\n*[[Georg Friedrich von Martens]]\n\n;19th century\n*[[Jeremy Bentham]]\n*[[Johann Kaspar Bluntschli|Johann Bluntschli]]\n*[[Henry Wheaton]]\n*[[Robert Phillimore]]\n*[[Henry Sumner Maine]]\n\n;20th century\n* [[William Howard Taft]]\n*[[L.

An integrated report is a concise communication about how an organization's strategy, governance, performance and prospects lead to the creation of value over the short, medium and long term.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=What is integrated reporting|url=http://www.theiirc.org/}}</ref>\n\nIt means the integrated representation of a company's [[performance management|performance]] in terms of both financial and  other value relevant information. Integrated Reporting provides greater context for performance data, clarifies how value relevant information fits into operations or a business, and may help make company [[decision making]] more long-term. While the communications that result from IR will be of benefit to a range of stakeholders, they are principally aimed at providers of financial [[capital allocation]] decisions.\n\nIR helps to complete financial and sustainability reports. A framework has been published, but some questions remain in order to know how to apply it. Do we need a new report? Do we need one report ?<ref name=\"auto\">Eccles, R.G., Krzus, M. (2010) One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy, Wiley, New Jersey, USA.</ref> Will this report be useful for investors, and for other stakeholders?<ref>Flower, J, (2015) \u2018But does sustainability need capitalism or an integrated report\u2019 a commentary on \u2018The International Integrated Reporting Council: A story of failure\u2019, ''[[Critical Perspectives on Accounting]]'', Volume 27, March 2015, p. 18-22</ref> Other questions could have been raised, such as who is really working for an integrated reporting, and who has interests in it.\n\n== The call for integrated reporting ==\n[[Capitalism]] relies on the [[efficiency|efficient]] allocation of capital to deliver [[return of investment|returns to investors]] over the short, medium and long term. It is the job of companies to manage the [[financial capital]] that [[investor]]s provide and also to create and preserve the value generated from other forms of non-financial data such as people, [[trademark]]s/[[copyright]]s and [[natural resource]]s or nature, the basis of all life. The western model of capitalism has been questioned following the onset of the [[banking crisis]] in 2007 because of its apparent dependence on short-term financial factors over other forms of capital and longer time scales. [[Corporate reporting]] no longer reflects the needs of the 21st century, resilient capitalism needs [[financial stability]] and sustainability in its exchange with nature in order to succeed&nbsp;\u2013 and Integrated Reporting is intended to underpin both of these problems through communicating to providers of financial capital the information that they need. Therefore, a report of financial data is no longer sufficient, but has to be extended with information about our exchanges with nature,<ref>I. Sch\u00f6ne, FAIR ECONOMICS = Nature, Money And People Beyond Neoclassical Thinking, Cambridge, UK, 2015</ref> as money is not natural, but a 7,000 year old cultural invention. Nature has never invented a means for its exchanges.\n\nAt the heart of IR is the growing realization that a wide range of factors determine the value of an organization&nbsp;\u2013 some of these are financial or tangible in nature and are easy to account for in [[financial statement]]s (e.g. property, cash), while many such as [[intellectual capital]], [[competition (economics)|competition]] and [[energy security]] are not. IR reflects the broad and longer-term consequences of the decisions organizations make, based on a wide range of factors, in order to create and sustain value. IR enables an organization to communicate in a clear, articulate way how it is drawing on all the resources and relationships it utilises to create and preserve value in the short, medium and long term, helping investors to [[risk management|manage risks]] and [[resource allocation|allocate resources]] most efficiently.\n\nIt is therefore necessary, to extend the reporting of only financial data with ecological data, for example about carbon dioxide emissions a company generates. When according to the 2015 [[Paris climate agreement]] carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced, than at first a report about this is necessary to aim at saving them. Integrated Reporting therefore needs two sides, the financial balancing data as well the non-financial ecological data, it must aim at two achievements: annual financial profit per as well as profit for nature, e.g. reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\n== History of integrated reporting ==\nIn  2009, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] convened a high level meeting of investors, standard setters, companies, accounting bodies and UN representatives including The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project,<ref name=\"accountingforsustainability.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/home/|title=The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project|work=accountingforsustainability.org|access-date=22 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914145238/http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/home/|archive-date=14 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), and the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI), to establish the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC), a body to oversee the creation of a globally accepted Integrated Reporting framework.

Launched in 2010 by the Prince of Wales with international partners. The IIRC was formerly known as the International Integrated Reporting Committee, being renamed in 2011. The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) acted as the Secretariat for the IIRC until January 2012.\n\nThe IIRC calls itself 'a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the accounting profession and NGOs. Together, this coalition shares the view that communication about businesses' value creation should be the next step in the evolution of corporate reporting'. It states its mission is to create the globally accepted International IR Framework that elicits from organizations material information about their strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a clear, concise and comparable format. The Framework is intended to underpin and accelerate the evolution of corporate reporting, reflecting developments in financial governance, management commentary and sustainability reporting.\n\nThe IIRC produced a 'Discussion Paper' in 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theiirc.org/resources-2/framework-development/discussion-paper/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207100402/http://www.theiirc.org/resources-2/framework-development/discussion-paper/ |archive-date=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> from which the overwhelming feedback demonstrated overwhelming support for Integrated Reporting and endorsed the development of a global Framework. It also concluded that the primary audience of integrated reports is investors in order to aid their allocation of financial capital.\n\n=== The IIRC Pilot Programme ===\n\nThe IIRC began a Pilot Programme in 2011 in order to underpin the development of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. The group of organizations participating in the Pilot Programme have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Framework. Paul Druckman, CEO IIRC, said \"We call the Pilot Programme our \"innovation hub\" - made up of people who want to push the boundaries just a little bit further, to challenge, or at least question orthodox thinking, and to acknowledge the importance of reporting to the way our organizations think and behave\".\n\nThere are over 90 businesses in the Pilot Programme Business Network include [[Unilever]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/|title=Unilever UK & Ireland - UK & Ireland|work=unilever.co.uk}}</ref> [[Coca-Cola]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.coca-cola.com/|title=Coca-Cola|work=coca-cola.com}}</ref> [[Microsoft]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx|title=Microsoft \u2013 Official Home Page|publisher=Microsoft|work=microsoft.com}}</ref> [[China Light and Power]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clpgroup.com/Pages/home.aspx|title=CLP Group - Powering Asia Responsibly|author=CLP Group|work=clpgroup.com}}</ref> [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]],<ref>http://www.hyundai-motor.co.jp/</ref> Diesel & Motor Enigineering PLC (Dimo-Sri Lanka)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimolanka.com/|title=Welcome to DIMO :: Diesel & Motor Engineering Plc|work=dimolanka.com}}</ref> and [[HSBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/|title=HSBC Personal Banking and Online Banking - HSBC UK|work=hsbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe IIRC, in collaboration with [[Principles for Responsible Investment|UNPRI]] set up an Investor Network as part of its Pilot Programme. It is made up of over 30 investor organizations in order to help shape the Framework by providing an investor's perspective on the shortfalls in current corporate reporting.\n\n=== The International Integrated Reporting Framework ===\n\nThe IIRC was created with the remit of developing the globally accepted International IR Framework that elicits from organizations material information about their strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a clear, concise and comparable format. The Framework will underpin and accelerate the evolution of corporate reporting, reflecting developments in financial, governance, management commentary and sustainability reporting. The benefits of the Framework are purported to be the enabling of informed decision-making that leads to efficient capital allocation and the creation and preservation of value.\n\nThe Framework is ultimately intended as a guidance for all businesses producing integrated reports.\n\n==National integrated reporting practices==\n===Netherlands===\nThe Dutch accountancy body, NBA (Koninklijke Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants) announced in 2015 that it would be collaborating with the IIRC \"to increase the momentum towards integrated reporting by raising awareness in markets across the world\".<ref>IIRC, [https://integratedreporting.org/news/new-collaboration-with-dutch-accountancy-body-to-spread-ir/ New collaboration with Dutch accountancy body to spread <IR>], published 28 February 2015, accessed 22 October 2019</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nCorporate reporting on financial and non-financial information in a single document has grown as companies such as BlackSun<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksunplc.com/|title=Black Sun Plc|website=www.blacksunplc.com}}</ref> have produced research<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksunplc.com/corporate/iirc_understanding_transformation/index.htm|title=BUILDING THE BUSINESS CASE FOR INTEGRATED REPORTING|website=www.blacksunplc.com}}</ref> which suggests that producing integrated reports will have a strong correlation to the resilience and ability of a business to create value in the short, medium and long term.

(2010) One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy, Wiley, New Jersey, USA.</ref> Will this report be useful for investors, and for other stakeholders?<ref>Flower, J, (2015) \u2018But does sustainability need capitalism or an integrated report\u2019 a commentary on \u2018The International Integrated Reporting Council: A story of failure\u2019, ''[[Critical Perspectives on Accounting]]'', Volume 27, March 2015, p. 18-22</ref> Other questions could have been raised, such as who is really working for an integrated reporting, and who has interests in it.\n\n== The call for integrated reporting ==\n[[Capitalism]] relies on the [[efficiency|efficient]] allocation of capital to deliver [[return of investment|returns to investors]] over the short, medium and long term. It is the job of companies to manage the [[financial capital]] that [[investor]]s provide and also to create and preserve the value generated from other forms of non-financial data such as people, [[trademark]]s/[[copyright]]s and [[natural resource]]s or nature, the basis of all life. The western model of capitalism has been questioned following the onset of the [[banking crisis]] in 2007 because of its apparent dependence on short term financial factors over other forms of capital and longer time scales. [[Corporate reporting]] no longer reflects the needs of the 21st century, resilient capitalism needs [[financial stability]] and sustainability in its exchange with nature in order to succeed&nbsp;\u2013 and Integrated Reporting is intended to underpin both of these problems through communicating to providers of financial capital the information that they need. Therefore, a report of financial data is no longer sufficient, but has to be extended with information about our exchanges with nature,<ref>I. Sch\u00f6ne, FAIR ECONOMICS = Nature, Money And People Beyond Neoclassical Thinking, Cambridge, UK, 2015</ref> as money is not natural, but a 7,000 year old cultural invention. Nature has never invented a means for its exchanges.\n\nAt the heart of IR is the growing realization that a wide range of factors determine the value of an organization&nbsp;\u2013 some of these are financial or tangible in nature and are easy to account for in [[financial statement]]s (e.g. property, cash), while many such as [[intellectual capital]], [[competition (economics)|competition]] and [[energy security]] are not. IR reflects the broad and longer-term consequences of the decisions organizations make, based on a wide range of factors, in order to create and sustain value. IR enables an organization to communicate in a clear, articulate way how it is drawing on all the resources and relationships it utilises to create and preserve value in the short, medium and long term, helping investors to [[risk management|manage risks]] and [[resource allocation|allocate resources]] most efficiently.\n\nIt is therefore necessary, to extend the reporting of only financial data with ecological data, for example about carbon dioxide emissions a company generates. When according to the 2015 [[Paris climate agreement]] carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced, than at first a report about this is necessary to aim at saving them. Integrated Reporting therefore needs two sides, the financial balancing data as well the non-financial ecological data, it must aim at two achievements: annual financial profit per as well as profit for nature, e.g. reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\n== History of integrated reporting ==\nIn  2009, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] convened a high level meeting of investors, standard setters, companies, accounting bodies and UN representatives including The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project,<ref name=\"accountingforsustainability.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/home/|title=The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project|work=accountingforsustainability.org|access-date=22 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914145238/http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/home/|archive-date=14 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), and the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI), to establish the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC), a body to oversee the creation of a globally accepted Integrated Reporting framework.

Launched in 2010 by the Prince of Wales with international partners. The IIRC was formerly known as the International Integrated Reporting Committee, being renamed in 2011. The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) acted as the Secretariat for the IIRC until January 2012.\n\nThe IIRC calls itself 'a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the accounting profession and NGOs. Together, this coalition shares the view that communication about businesses' value creation should be the next step in the evolution of corporate reporting'. It states its mission is to create the globally accepted International IR Framework that elicits from organizations material information about their strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a clear, concise and comparable format. The Framework is intended to underpin and accelerate the evolution of corporate reporting, reflecting developments in financial governance, management commentary and sustainability reporting.\n\nThe IIRC produced a 'Discussion Paper' in 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theiirc.org/resources-2/framework-development/discussion-paper/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207100402/http://www.theiirc.org/resources-2/framework-development/discussion-paper/ |archive-date=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> from which the overwhelming feedback demonstrated overwhelming support for Integrated Reporting and endorsed the development of a global Framework. It also concluded that the primary audience of integrated reports is investors in order to aid their allocation of financial capital.\n\n=== The IIRC Pilot Programme ===\n\nThe IIRC began a Pilot Programme in 2011 in order to underpin the development of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. The group of organizations participating in the Pilot Programme have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Framework. Paul Druckman, CEO IIRC, said \"We call the Pilot Programme our \"innovation hub\" - made up of people who want to push the boundaries just a little bit further, to challenge, or at least question orthodox thinking, and to acknowledge the importance of reporting to the way our organizations think and behave\".\n\nThere are over 90 businesses in the Pilot Programme Business Network include [[Unilever]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/|title=Unilever UK & Ireland - UK & Ireland|work=unilever.co.uk}}</ref> [[Coca-Cola]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.coca-cola.com/|title=Coca-Cola|work=coca-cola.com}}</ref> [[Microsoft]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx|title=Microsoft \u2013 Official Home Page|publisher=Microsoft|work=microsoft.com}}</ref> [[China Light and Power]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clpgroup.com/Pages/home.aspx|title=CLP Group - Powering Asia Responsibly|author=CLP Group|work=clpgroup.com}}</ref> [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]],<ref>http://www.hyundai-motor.co.jp/</ref> Diesel & Motor Enigineering PLC (Dimo-Sri Lanka)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimolanka.com/|title=Welcome to DIMO :: Diesel & Motor Engineering Plc|work=dimolanka.com}}</ref> and [[HSBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/|title=HSBC Personal Banking and Online Banking - HSBC UK|work=hsbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe IIRC, in collaboration with [[Principles for Responsible Investment|UNPRI]] set up an Investor Network as part of its Pilot Programme. It is made up of over 30 investor organizations in order to help shape the Framework by providing an investor's perspective on the shortfalls in current corporate reporting.\n\n=== The International Integrated Reporting Framework ===\n\nThe IIRC was created with the remit of developing the globally accepted International IR Framework that elicits from organizations material information about their strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a clear, concise and comparable format. The Framework will underpin and accelerate the evolution of corporate reporting, reflecting developments in financial, governance, management commentary and sustainability reporting. The benefits of the Framework are purported to be the enabling of informed decision-making that leads to efficient capital allocation and the creation and preservation of value.\n\nThe Framework is ultimately intended as a guidance for all businesses producing integrated reports.\n\n==National integrated reporting practices==\n===Netherlands===\nThe Dutch accountancy body, NBA (Koninklijke Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants) announced in 2015 that it would be collaborating with the IIRC \"to increase the momentum towards integrated reporting by raising awareness in markets across the world\".<ref>IIRC, [https://integratedreporting.org/news/new-collaboration-with-dutch-accountancy-body-to-spread-ir/ New collaboration with Dutch accountancy body to spread <IR>], published 28 February 2015, accessed 22 October 2019</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nCorporate reporting on financial and non-financial information in a single document has grown as companies such as BlackSun<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksunplc.com/|title=Black Sun Plc|website=www.blacksunplc.com}}</ref> have produced research<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksunplc.com/corporate/iirc_understanding_transformation/index.htm|title=BUILDING THE BUSINESS CASE FOR INTEGRATED REPORTING|website=www.blacksunplc.com}}</ref> which suggests that producing integrated reports will have a strong correlation to the resilience and ability of a business to create value in the short, medium and long term.

In addition to statutory indexation of the threshold and rate bands, I propose this year to reform the tax radically.\n\n:In essence, the capital transfer tax is two taxes, as its two separate scales imply: an inheritance tax and a lifetime gifts tax. We have had an inheritance tax in some shape or form ever since Sir William Harcourt introduced his estate duty in 1894. But the lifetime gifts tax which the Labour Government introduced in 1974, in the teeth of united Conservative opposition, is an unwelcome and unwarranted impost. By deterring lifetime giving, it has had the effect of locking in assets, particularly the ownership of family businesses, often to the detriment of the businesses concerned.\n\n:Accordingly, I propose to abolish entirely the tax on lifetime gifts to individuals. As with the old estate duty, there will be a tapered charge on gifts made within seven years of death and provisions to charge gifts made with reservation; and the regime for trusts, which is needed as a protection for the death charge, will be kept broadly unchanged....

In particular, it does not bite on transfers of wealth made long enough before death to fall outside the charge....

In addition to statutory indexation of the threshold and rate bands, I propose this year to reform the tax radically.\n\n:In essence, the capital transfer tax is two taxes, as its two separate scales imply: an inheritance tax and a lifetime gifts tax. We have had an inheritance tax in some shape or form ever since Sir William Harcourt introduced his estate duty in 1894. But the lifetime gifts tax which the Labour Government introduced in 1974, in the teeth of united Conservative opposition, is an unwelcome and unwarranted impost. By deterring lifetime giving, it has had the effect of locking in assets, particularly the ownership of family businesses, often to the detriment of the businesses concerned.\n\n:Accordingly, I propose to abolish entirely the tax on lifetime gifts to individuals. As with the old estate duty, there will be a tapered charge on gifts made within seven years of death and provisions to charge gifts made with reservation; and the regime for trusts, which is needed as a protection for the death charge, will be kept broadly unchanged....

of the government of [[El Salvador]], created on March 28, 2011 as an initiative of the then First Lady [[Vanda Pignato]]. It consists on offering aid to victims of [[violence against women]], as well provide access to women's healthcare services, [[financial advice]], and career training. The six Ciudad Mujer centers, located throughout the country, offer services from 15 Salvadoran government agencies in one location. These include job training and financial loans to offer a chance for [[economic independence]]. Ciudad Mujer also provides healthcare services, including [[forensic]] laboratories and legal aid for victims of sexual assault, reproductive services, [[neonatal]] care and breast cancer prevention. An estimated 603,000 women have utilized Ciudad Mujer, as of November 2014.\n\nThe project was placed under the responsibility of the Secretariat for Social Inclusion, under the responsibility of the First Lady.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciudadmujer.gob.sv/|title=\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Ciudad Mujer? \u2014 Ciudad Mujer|last=|first=|date=|website=Ciudad Mujer|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the President [[Nayib Bukele]]'s takeover in 2019, Ciudad Mujer became part of the new Ministry of Local Development, since the secretariat under whose charge it had been placed had been abolished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Ciudad-Mujer-pasa-a-ser-parte-de-Ministerio-de-Desarrollo-Local-20190604-0305.html|title=Ciudad Mujer pasa a ser parte de Ministerio de Desarrollo Local|last=|first=|date=4 June 2019|website=[[La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica]]|language=es-ES|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Ciudad Mujer idea was first announced during [[Mauricio Funes]] political campaign on 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elfaro.net/es/201103/noticias/3846/El-primer-paso-de-Ciudad-Mujer.htm|title=El primer paso de Ciudad Mujer|last=Baires Quezada|first=Rodrigo|date=2011-03-28|website=El Faro|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406025352/https://elfaro.net/es/201103/noticias/3846/El-primer-paso-de-Ciudad-Mujer.htm|archive-date=2020-04-06|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nCiudad Mujer is based on the idea of unifying all State institutions that provide services to women in the same space.

The Task Force could act quickly because it built upon the experience and frustrations of state governments, central government agencies, universities, and the software industry.

Often, for a formal meal, a lamb or chicken dish is next, or couscous topped with meat and vegetables.

Bread in Morocco is principally made from durum wheat semolina known as [[Khubz|khobz]]. Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread or baguettes. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.\n\nIn addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as [[khlea]]<ref>[http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/glossary/g/khlea_khlii.htm \"klii\"]</ref> and g'did (basically [[sheep]] [[bacon]]), which are used to flavor tagines or used in \"el rghaif\", a folded savory Moroccan pancake.\n\n== Soups ==\n[[Harira]], a typical heavy [[soup]], eaten during winter to warm up and is usually served for dinner. It is typically eaten with plain bread or with [[date (fruit)|dates]] during the month of [[Ramadan]].

Traditionally, making good mint tea in Morocco is considered an art form and the drinking of it with friends and family is often a daily tradition. The pouring technique is as crucial as the quality of the tea itself. Moroccan tea pots have long, curved pouring spouts and this allows the tea to be poured evenly into tiny glasses from a height. For the best taste, glasses are filled in two stages. The Moroccans traditionally like tea with bubbles, so while pouring they hold the teapot high above the glasses. Finally, the tea is accompanied with hard sugar cones or lumps.<ref>Otal, 1999. p. 61</ref> Morocco has an abundance of oranges and tangerines, so fresh orange juice is easily found freshly squeezed and is cheap.[[File:Moroccan Mint Tea.jpg|thumb|Mint tea|185x185px]]\n\n==Snacks and fast food==\nSelling [[fast food]] in the street has long been a tradition, and the best example is [[Djemaa el Fna|Djemaa el Fna square]] in [[Marrakech]].

Often, for a formal meal, a lamb or chicken dish is next, or couscous topped with meat and vegetables. Moroccans either eat with fork, knife and spoon or with their hands using bread as a utensil depending on the dish served.

[[Beef]] is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a [[tagine]] with a wide selection of vegetables. Chicken is also very commonly used in tagines, or roasted.\n\nSince Morocco lies on two coasts, the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Mediterranean]], Moroccan cuisine has ample seafood dishes. [[European pilchard]] is caught in large but declining quantities.<ref name=\"Lanier1981\">{{cite book|last=Lanier|first=B.

Bread in Morocco is principally made from durum wheat semolina known as [[Khubz|khobz]]. Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread or baguettes. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.\n\nIn addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as [[khlea]]<ref>[http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/glossary/g/khlea_khlii.htm \"klii\"]</ref> and g'did (basically [[sheep]] [[bacon]]), which are used to flavor tagines or used in \"el rghaif\", a folded savory Moroccan pancake.\n\n== Soups ==\n[[Harira]], a typical heavy [[soup]], eaten during winter to warm up and is usually served for dinner. It is typically eaten with plain bread or with [[date (fruit)|dates]] during the month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Bissara]] is a [[broad bean]]-based soup that is also consumed during the colder months of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nwshowcase/journeys/how-to-eat-breakfast-like-a-local-around-the-world/|title=How to eat breakfast like a local around the world  -  Provided By Advertising Publications|last=Valenta|first=Kyle|date=June 23, 2016|website=The Seattle Times|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Salads ==\n[[File:Salad asorti, Beni Mellal, Morocco.jpg|thumb|Salad asorti, served in Beni Mellal]]\n\n[[Salad]]s include both raw and cooked vegetables, served either hot or cold.<ref name=\"zeldes\" /> Cold salads include ''[[zaalouk]],'' an [[aubergine]] and [[tomato]] mixture, and taktouka (a mixture of tomatoes, smoked green peppers, garlic and spices) characteristic of the cities of Taza and Fes, in the Atlas.<ref name=\"zeldes\">{{Cite web | last=Zeldes | first=Leah A. | authorlink= | title=Eat this!

It consists of braised mallow leaves, but can also be made with spinach or arugula, with parsley, cilantro, lemon, olive oil and olives.\n\n== Desserts ==\nUsually, seasonal fruits rather than cooked desserts are served at the close of a meal.

Traditionally, making good mint tea in Morocco is considered an art form and the drinking of it with friends and family is often a daily tradition. The pouring technique is as crucial as the quality of the tea itself. Moroccan tea pots have long, curved pouring spouts and this allows the tea to be poured evenly into tiny glasses from a height. For the best taste, glasses are filled in two stages. The Moroccans traditionally like tea with bubbles, so while pouring they hold the teapot high above the glasses. Finally, the tea is accompanied with hard sugar cones or lumps.<ref>Otal, 1999. p. 61</ref> Morocco has an abundance of oranges and tangerines, so fresh orange juice is easily found freshly squeezed and is cheap.[[File:Moroccan Mint Tea.jpg|thumb|Mint tea|185x185px]]\n\n==Snacks and fast food==\nSelling [[fast food]] in the street has long been a tradition, and the best example is [[Djemaa el Fna|Djemaa el Fna square]] in [[Marrakech]]. Starting in the 1980s, new snack restaurants started serving \"Bocadillo\" (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for a [[sandwich]]). Though the composition of a bocadillo varies by region, it is usually a [[baguette]] filled with [[salad]] and a choice of meats or sausage and french fries are placed inside the sandwich.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bocadillo (Spanish/Moroccan Sandwich)|url=http://marocmama.com/bocadillo-spanish-moroccan-sandwich/|website=Maroc Mama A Fearless Guide to Food and Travel|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Dairy product]] shops locally called Mhlaba, are very prevalent all around the country.

an alliance of three [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] {{lang|nci|[[altepetl]]}} city/states: {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|nci|[[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|nci|[[Tlacopan]]|italic=no}}. These three city-states ruled the area in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish {{lang|es|[[conquistador]]es}} and their native allies under {{lang|es|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]|italic=no}} defeated them in 1521.\n\nThe Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of {{lang|nci|[[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]|italic=no}} and its former tributary provinces.<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/> Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}} quickly became dominant militarily.<ref name=\"Hassig 1988\">Hassig 1988</ref> By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}, while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.\n\nThe alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded rapidly after its formation. At its height, the alliance controlled most of central [[Mexico]] as well as some more distant territories within [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Soconusco|Xoconochco province]], an Aztec [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] near the present-day [[Guatemala]]n border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as \"[[hegemony|hegemonic]]\" or \"indirect\".<ref name=\"Smith2001\">Smith 2001</ref> The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual [[tribute]] to the Alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability, and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.\n\nThe [[state religion]] of the empire was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshiping a diverse pantheon that included dozens of [[deities]]. Many had officially recognized cults large enough so that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The imperial cult, specifically, was that of {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica. Peoples in conquered provinces were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions, so long as they added the imperial god {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}} to their local pantheons.\n\n==Etymology and definitions==\n{{Main|Aztec#Definitions}}\nThe word \"[[Aztec]]\" in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Triple Alliance empire, the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the [[Mexica]] ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples.<ref name=\"Smith2009p3-4\">Smith 2009 pp. 3\u20134</ref> The name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning \"people from [[Aztlan]],\" reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">Smith 1984</ref> For the purpose of this article, \"Aztec\" refers only to those cities that constituted or were subject to the Triple Alliance. For the broader use of the term, see the article on [[Aztec| Aztec civilization]].This info is probably ostly fake, the Aztecs lived way before we did,Thank yo for wasting your time.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First page of [[Codex Boturini]], showing the migration of the Mexica.]]\n===Before the Aztec Empire===\nNahua peoples descended from [[Chichimeca|Chichimec peoples]] who migrated to central Mexico from the north in the early 13th century.<ref name=\"Davies1973p3-22\">Davies 1973, pp. 3\u201322</ref> The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history as they sought political legitimacy.<ref>Alfredo L\u00f3pez Austin, \"Aztec\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 1, p. 68. Oxford University Press 2001.</ref>  According to the pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history, the place of origin was called [[Aztl\u00e1n]]. Early migrants settled the [[Basin of Mexico]] and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early [[Nahuas|Nahua]] city-states or ''[[altepetl]]'', were ruled by dynastic heads called ''[[tlatoani|tlahtohqueh]]'' (singular, ''tlato\u0101ni''). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.<ref name=Smith2009p37>Smith 2009 p. 37</ref>\n\nThese early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.<ref>Calnek 1978</ref> The [[Mexica]] were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.<ref name=\"Davies1973\">Davies 1973</ref> The Mexica persuaded the king of [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the [[Toltecs]], to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called [[Chapultepec]] (''Chapoltep\u0113c,'' \"in the hill of grasshoppers\"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.<ref name=\"Tezozomocp49-51\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975 pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\nAfter the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. According to mythological native accounts, the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin, on the command of their god [[Xipe Totec]].<ref name=\"Tezozomocp52-60\">Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975), pp. 52\u201360</ref> When the ruler of Culhuacan learned of this, he attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force. The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], where an eagle nested on a [[nopal]] cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their gods and founded their new city, [[Tenochtitlan]], on this island in the year ''\u014dme calli,'' or \"Two House\" (1325 AD).<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/>\n\n===Aztec warfare===\n{{Main|Aztec warfare}}\nThe Mexican rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power.  The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.\n\nThe new Mexica city-state allied with the city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] and paid tribute to its ruler, [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p44\">Smith 2009 p. 44</ref> With Mexica assistance, Azcopotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire. Until this point, the Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son, [[Acamapichtli]], was enthroned as the first ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan in the year 1372.<ref name=\"Tezozomoc\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, the [[Acolhua]] city of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.<ref name=\"Smith2009p46\">Smith 2009 p. 46</ref>\n\n===Tepanec War===\n\nIn 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died,<ref name=\"Bierhorst1985\">{{cite book|author=John Bierhorst|title=A Nahuatl-English Dictionary and Concordance to the Cantares Mexicanos: With an Analytic Transcription and Grammatical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRUJDW2tW1YC&pg=PA319|year=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1183-8|page=319}}</ref><ref name=\"Somervill2009\">{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

But his son, [[Maxtla]], soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler [[Chimalpopoca]]. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nThe new Mexica ruler [[Itzcoatl]] continued to defy Maxtla; he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\">Smith 2009 p. 47</ref> Maxtla similarly turned against the [[Acolhua]], and the king of Texcoco, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city, [[Tlacopan]]. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/>\n\nAfter the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and in 1430 <ref name=\"arqueologiamexicana.mx\"/>, the three remaining cities formed a treaty known today as the Triple Alliance.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/> The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. Tribute was to be divided so that two-fifths each went to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, and one-fifth went to Tlacopan. Each of the three kings of the alliance in turn assumed the title \"huetlatoani\" (\"Elder Speaker\", often translated as \"Emperor\"). In this role, each temporarily held a ''[[de jure]]'' position above the rulers of other city-states (\"tlatoani\").<ref name=\"Evans2008p460\">Evans 2008, p. 460</ref>\n\nIn the next 100 years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan came to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]]. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica ''huetlatoani'' in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created title of \"[[Cihuacoatl (position)|Cihuacoatl]]\", equivalent to something between \"Prime Minister\" and \"Viceroy\".<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/><ref>The term ''cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' literally means \"woman-snake\" or \"female snake\", and the origin of this designation is not well understood. The position was certainly not reserved for women, although the title may perhaps suggest a metaphoric dichotomy between the \"masculine\" ''Tlahto\u0101ni'' dealing with external imperial affairs and the \"feminine\" ''Cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' managing the domestic affairs.</ref>\n\n===Imperial reforms===\n[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar Warrior]], from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]\n\nShortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was \"not wise that all the people should know the paintings\".<ref name=\"Leon-Portilla1963p155\">Leon-Portilla 1963 p. 155</ref> Even if he did order such book-burnings, it was probably limited primarily to documents containing political propaganda from previous regimes; he thereafter rewrote the history of the Aztecs, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role. {{Citation needed|reason=How do we know the book-burnings were limited to \"propaganda\"? This is a serious historical claim that should be backed with a source.|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\">Smith 2009 p. 48</ref> Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\">Evans 2008 p. 462</ref> This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by ''calpixqueh'', or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nMoctezuma issued new laws that further separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\">Duran 1994, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> By royal decree, a religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\"/> Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a \"telpochcalli\" where they received basic religious instruction and military training.<ref name=\"Evans2008p456-457\">Evans 2008 pp. 456\u2013457</ref> A second, more prestigious type of school called a \"calmecac\" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called \"quauhpilli\" that could be conferred on commoners.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\"/> This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English [[knight]]). In some rare cases, commoners that received this title married into royal families and became kings.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nOne component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the [[flower war|Flower Wars]]. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice.<ref name=\"Evans2008p451\">Evans 2008, p. 451</ref> According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454.<ref name=\"Duran1994\">Duran 1994</ref> The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].\n\n===Early years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztecexpansion.png|thumb|450px|Map of the expansion of the empire, showing the areas conquered by the Aztec rulers.<ref>Based on Hassig 1988.</ref>]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl rapidly consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p47-48\">Smith 2009 pp. 47\u201348</ref> These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.\n\nOn the death of Itzcoatl, Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided.<ref>Smith 2009 p. 49</ref> Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into [[Oaxaca]]. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son, [[Axayacatl]]. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year-reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nAt the same time as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the [[Pur\u00e9pecha Empire]] in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Pur\u00e9pecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\">Pollard 1993, p. 169</ref> In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Pur\u00e9pecha attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Pur\u00e9pecha in battle again.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\">Smith 2009 p. 51</ref>\n\nIn 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died and his son [[Nezahualpilli]] was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco.<ref name=\"Evans2008p450\">Evans 2008, p. 450</ref> This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Axayacatl was replaced by his brother [[Tizoc]]. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Apparently due to his incompetence, Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/>\n\n===Later years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztec Empire 1519 map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire, according to Mar\u00eda del Carmen Solanes Carraro and Enrique Vela Ram\u00edrez.]]\n\nTizoc was succeeded by his brother [[Ahuitzotl]] in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the [[Oaxaca Valley]] and the [[Soconusco|Soconusco Coast]]. Due to increased border skirmishes with the Pur\u00e9pechas, Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\">Smith 2009 p. 54</ref> The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of [[Guerrero]].\n\nBy the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance.<ref>Smith 2009 pp. 50\u201351</ref> Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title \"huehuetlatoani\" (\"Eldest Speaker\") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Even though the alliance still technically ran the empire, the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.\n\nAhuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuzoma II]] in 1502. Moctezuma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire once again.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169-170\">Pollard 1993 pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding. The Pur\u00e9pechas defeated them and the army withdrew.\n\nMoctezuma II instituted more imperial reforms.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> After the death of Nezahualcoyotl, the Mexica Emperors had become the ''de facto'' rulers of the alliance. Moctezuma II used his reign to attempt to consolidate power more closely with the Mexica Emperor.<ref>Davies 1973 p. 216</ref> He removed many of Ahuitzotl's advisors and had several of them executed.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> He also abolished the \"quauhpilli\" class, destroying the chance for commoners to advance to the nobility. His reform efforts were cut short by the Spanish Conquest in 1519.\n\n===Spanish conquest===\n{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n[[File:Basin of Mexico 1519 map-en.svg|thumb|The [[Valley of Mexico]] at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish Conquest]].]]\n\nSpanish expedition leader [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] landed in Yucat\u00e1n in 1519 with approximately 630 men (most armed with only a sword and shield). Cort\u00e9s had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1squez]], but had stolen the boats and left without permission.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp35-40\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 35\u201340</ref> At the island of Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where after a brief battle with the local army, Cort\u00e9s was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter, Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cort\u00e9s a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named [[La Malinche]] (she was known also as Malinalli [mali\u02c8nal\u02d0i], Malintzin [ma\u02c8lintsin] or Do\u00f1a Marina [\u02c8do\u0272a ma\u02c8\u027eina] ). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Once Malinche learned Spanish, she became Cort\u00e9s's translator for both language and culture, and was a key figure in interactions with [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] rulers. An important article, \"Rethinking Malinche\" by [[Frances Karttunen]] examines her role in the conquest and beyond.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Rethinking Malinche\" in ''Indian Women of Early Mexico,'' Susan Schroeder, et al. eds. University of Oklahoma Press 1997.</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s then sailed from Campeche to [[Cempoala]], a tributary province of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Nearby, he founded the town of [[Veracruz]] where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor, [[Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin|Motecuzoma II]]. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cort\u00e9s went to Cempoala to meet with the local [[Totonac]] leaders. After the Totonac ruler told Cort\u00e9s of his various grievances against the Mexica, Cort\u00e9s convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp92-94\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 92\u201394</ref> Cort\u00e9s subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it. Having effectively declared war on the Aztecs, the Totonacs provided Cort\u00e9s with 20 companies of soldiers for his march to Tlaxcala.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003p120\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, p. 120</ref> At this time several of Cort\u00e9s's soldiers attempted to mutiny.

However, the Tlaxcalan general [[Xicotencatl the Younger]] believed them to be hostile, and attacked. After fighting several close battles, Cort\u00e9s eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cort\u00e9s then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala, and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs, in addition to the Spanish soldiers.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cort\u00e9s claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> In a pre-emptive response, Cort\u00e9s directed his troops attack and kill a large number of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.\n\nFollowing the massacre at Cholula, Hernan Cort\u00e9s and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\">Smith 2009 p. 275</ref> After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca.

Then, in 1520, a second, larger Spanish expedition arrived under the command of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent by Diego Vel\u00e1squez with the goal of arresting Cort\u00e9s for treason.

Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan and fought his way to the palace. He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down. However, by this point the ruling council of Tenochtitlan had voted to depose Motecuzoma and had elected his brother [[Cuitlahuac]] as the new emperor.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\" /> One of the Aztec soldiers struck Motecuzoma in the head with a sling stone, and he died several days later \u2013 although the exact details of his death, particularly who was responsible, are unclear.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\" />\n\n[[File:Aztec Indians Mexico Tlaxcalan Cortez.jpg|thumb|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] led Spanish soldiers with [[Tlaxcala]]n allies in the conquests of Jalisco and Colima of West Mexico.]]\n\nThe Spaniards and their allies, realizing they were vulnerable to the hostile Mexica in Tenochtitlan following Moctezuma's death, attempted to retreat without detection in what is known as the \"Sad Night\" or [[La Noche Triste]]. Spaniards and their Indian allies were discovered clandestinely retreating, and then were forced to fight their way out of the city, with heavy loss of life. Some Spaniards lost their lives by drowning, loaded down with gold.<ref>''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', chapter 3 \"Conquest and Colonization\", Ida Altman, S.L.

In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian [[Alexander J. Motyl]] the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces; it merely expected tributes to be paid.<ref name=\"motyl\">{{cite book\n | last = Motyl\n | first = Alexander J.\n | title = Imperial Ends: The Decay, Collapse, and Revival of Empires\n | year = 2001\n | publisher = Columbia University Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-231-12110-5\n | pages = 13, 19\u201321, 32\u201336\n}}</ref> The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. not all of its dominated territories were connected by land. For example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The [[hegemonic]] nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC</ref>\n\nAlthough the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states (individually known as ''[[altepetl]]'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or ''tlatoani'' (literally \"speaker\", plural ''tlatoque'') from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. Even after the empire was formed in 1428 and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581\u2013595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered that the term \"Aztec empire\" is a modern one, not one used by the Aztec themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three [[Nahuatl]]-speaking city states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Over time, asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states, Tenochtitlan, above the other two. The \"Triple Alliance\" came to establish [[hegemony]] over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. Administration of the empire was performed through largely traditional, indirect means. However, over time something of a nascent [[bureaucracy]] may have been beginning to form insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.\n\n===Central administration===\n[[Image:Tlacochcalcatl.jpg|thumb|180px|A ''[[tlacochcalcatl]]'' pictured in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]\nBefore the reign of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] (1429\u20131472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., \"speakers\"), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' (lit., \"great speaker\") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with ''calpixque'' stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.<ref>\nEvans, Susan T. (2004). Ancient Mexico & Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. Thames & Hudson: New York, pp. 443\u2013446, 449\u2013451</ref>\n\nYet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the ''external'' issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the ''[[Cihuacoatl]]'' to govern a given city itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; [[Tlacaelel]], for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title \"Cihuacoatl\", which means \"female snake\" (it is the name of a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European [[Viceroy]] or [[Prime Minister]], reflect the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of Nahua [[cosmology]]. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the \"female\" wet season, those of the latter with the \"male\" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of [[Atzcapotzalco]], [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], and Tenochtitlan's ally [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.<ref>\nCoe, Michael D. (1984). Mexico, 3rd Ed.

Thames & Hudson: London, pp. 200\u2013202.\n</ref>\n\nEarly in the history of the empire, Tenochtitlan developed a four-member military and advisory Council which assisted the Huey tlatoani in his decision-making: the ''tlacochcalcatl''; the ''tlaccatecatl''; the ''ezhuahuacatl'';<ref name=\"BerdanAnawalt1992p196\">\nBerdan, Francis F. and Patricia Rieff Anawalt. 1992. The Codex Mendoza Vol. 1. University of California Press, p. 196</ref> and the ''tlillancalqui''. This design not only provided advise for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth [[Huey Tlatoani]] could only be selected from the Council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the Council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the ''cuauhchique'' (\"shorn ones\") and the ''otontin'' (\"[[Otomi (military)|Otomies]]\").<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M.

Thames & Hudson: London, p. 204.</ref>\n\n===Provincial administration===\nTraditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials. The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular ''calpixqui'', plural ''calpixque'') were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into tributary and strategic provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or ''huecalpixque'', whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the ''huetlatoani'', but rather by a separate position altogether: the ''petlacalcatl''. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, a military governor, or ''cuauhtlatoani'', was placed at the head of provincial supervision.<ref>Calnek, Edward E. (1982). Patterns of Empire Formation in the Valley of Mexico, in The Inca and Aztec States: 1400\u20131800. Collier, Rosaldo & Wirth (Eds.) Academic Press: New York, pp. 56\u201359</ref> During the reign of Moctezuma I, the calpixque system was elaborated, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. One was stationed in the province itself, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Tribute was drawn from commoners, the ''macehualtin'', and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (''tlatoque''), lesser rulers (''teteuctin''), or provincial nobility (''pipiltin'').<ref>Smith, Michael E. (1986). Social Stratification in the Aztec Empire: A View from the Provinces, in American Anthropologist,\n(88)1, p. 74</ref>\n\nTribute collection was supervised by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the ''pipiltin'' (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as ''pochteca''. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The power, political and economic, of the pochteca was strongly tied to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (''teucnenenque'', or \"travelers of the lord\") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], having administrative duties within their own [[Estates of the Realm|estate]].<ref>Kurtz, Donald V.

As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, it was Tenochtitlan which assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, it was Tenochtitlan which became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (2001). Religion and state in the Aztec Empire, in Empires (Alcock et al, Eds). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 284</ref>\n\nThough they were not described by the Aztec this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate [[client states]] which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under \"mutual consent\". Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.<ref name=Evans470-471>Evans, pp. 470\u2013471</ref><ref name=Smith1-2>Smith, Michael E.

''Tlatocayotl'', or the principle of rulership, established that this divine right was inherited by descent. Political order was therefore also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For that reason, whenever a tlatoani was killed or otherwise removed from their station, a relative and member of the same bloodline was typically placed in their stead. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, ''hueitlatocayotl'', standing in superior contrast to the lesser ''tlatocayotl'' principle.<ref>Almaz\u00e1n, pp. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\nExpansion of the empire was guided by a [[militaristic]] interpretation of Nahua religion, specifically a devout veneration of the sun god, [[Huitzilopochtli]]. Militaristic state rituals were performed throughout the year according to a ceremonial calendar of events, rites, and mock battles.<ref>Brumfiel (2001), pp. 287, 288\u2013301</ref> The time period they lived in was understood as the ''Ollintonatiuh'', or Sun of Movement, which was believed to be the final age after which humanity would be destroyed. It was under Tlacaelel that Huitzilopochtli assumed his elevated role in the state pantheon and who argued that it was through blood sacrifice that the Sun would be maintained and thereby stave off the end of the world. It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of [[human sacrifice]] under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.<ref>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel. (1963).

University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, pp. 6, 161\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Law==\nThe most developed [[Code (law)|code of law]] was developed in the city-state of Texcoco under its ruler [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. It was a formal written code, not merely a collection of customary practices. The sources for knowing about the legal code are colonial-era writings by Franciscan [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], Franciscan [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], and Texcocan historians [[Juan Bautista Pomar]], and [[Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilxochitl]]. The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, that is cases were tried by particular types of evidence and the social status of the litigants was disregarded, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.<ref>Offner, Jerome A. ''Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.81-82.</ref>\n\nMuch less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period.<ref>Offner, 1983, p. 83</ref> It was established under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, ''pochteca'' could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, [[Court-martial|military courts]] dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an [[appeal]] process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a [[supreme court]] and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the ''[[Huey tlatoani]]'', who had the right to appoint lesser judges.<ref>Kurtz, p. 307</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\n{{see also|Aztec emperors family tree}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Tenochtitlan\n!

These three city-states ruled the area in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish {{lang|es|[[conquistador]]es}} and their native allies under {{lang|es|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]|italic=no}} defeated them in 1521.\n\nThe Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of {{lang|nci|[[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]|italic=no}} and its former tributary provinces.<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/> Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}} quickly became dominant militarily.<ref name=\"Hassig 1988\">Hassig 1988</ref> By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}, while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.\n\nThe alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded rapidly after its formation. At its height, the alliance controlled most of central [[Mexico]] as well as some more distant territories within [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Soconusco|Xoconochco province]], an Aztec [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] near the present-day [[Guatemala]]n border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as \"[[hegemony|hegemonic]]\" or \"indirect\".<ref name=\"Smith2001\">Smith 2001</ref> The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual [[tribute]] to the Alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability, and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.\n\nThe [[state religion]] of the empire was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshiping a diverse pantheon that included dozens of [[deities]]. Many had officially recognized cults large enough so that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The imperial cult, specifically, was that of {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica. Peoples in conquered provinces were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions, so long as they added the imperial god {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}} to their local pantheons.\n\n==Etymology and definitions==\n{{Main|Aztec#Definitions}}\nThe word \"[[Aztec]]\" in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Triple Alliance empire, the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the [[Mexica]] ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples.<ref name=\"Smith2009p3-4\">Smith 2009 pp. 3\u20134</ref> The name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning \"people from [[Aztlan]],\" reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">Smith 1984</ref> For the purpose of this article, \"Aztec\" refers only to those cities that constituted or were subject to the Triple Alliance. For the broader use of the term, see the article on [[Aztec| Aztec civilization]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First page of [[Codex Boturini]], showing the migration of the Mexica.]]\n===Before the Aztec Empire===\nNahua peoples descended from [[Chichimeca|Chichimec peoples]] who migrated to central Mexico from the north in the early 13th century.<ref name=\"Davies1973p3-22\">Davies 1973, pp. 3\u201322</ref> The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history as they sought political legitimacy.<ref>Alfredo L\u00f3pez Austin, \"Aztec\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 1, p. 68. Oxford University Press 2001.</ref>  According to the pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history, the place of origin was called [[Aztl\u00e1n]]. Early migrants settled the [[Basin of Mexico]] and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early [[Nahuas|Nahua]] city-states or ''[[altepetl]]'', were ruled by dynastic heads called ''[[tlatoani|tlahtohqueh]]'' (singular, ''tlato\u0101ni''). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.<ref name=Smith2009p37>Smith 2009 p. 37</ref>\n\nThese early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.<ref>Calnek 1978</ref> The [[Mexica]] were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.<ref name=\"Davies1973\">Davies 1973</ref> The Mexica persuaded the king of [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the [[Toltecs]], to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called [[Chapultepec]] (''Chapoltep\u0113c,'' \"in the hill of grasshoppers\"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.<ref name=\"Tezozomocp49-51\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975 pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\nAfter the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. According to mythological native accounts, the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin, on the command of their god [[Xipe Totec]].<ref name=\"Tezozomocp52-60\">Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975), pp. 52\u201360</ref> When the ruler of Culhuacan learned of this, he attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force. The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], where an eagle nested on a [[nopal]] cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their gods and founded their new city, [[Tenochtitlan]], on this island in the year ''\u014dme calli,'' or \"Two House\" (1325 AD).<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/>\n\n===Aztec warfare===\n{{Main|Aztec warfare}}\nThe Mexican rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power.  The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.\n\nThe new Mexica city-state allied with the city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] and paid tribute to its ruler, [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p44\">Smith 2009 p. 44</ref> With Mexica assistance, Azcopotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire. Until this point, the Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son, [[Acamapichtli]], was enthroned as the first ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan in the year 1372.<ref name=\"Tezozomoc\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, the [[Acolhua]] city of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.<ref name=\"Smith2009p46\">Smith 2009 p. 46</ref>\n\n===Tepanec War===\n\nIn 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died,<ref name=\"Bierhorst1985\">{{cite book|author=John Bierhorst|title=A Nahuatl-English Dictionary and Concordance to the Cantares Mexicanos: With an Analytic Transcription and Grammatical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRUJDW2tW1YC&pg=PA319|year=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1183-8|page=319}}</ref><ref name=\"Somervill2009\">{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

But his son, [[Maxtla]], soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler [[Chimalpopoca]]. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nThe new Mexica ruler [[Itzcoatl]] continued to defy Maxtla; he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\">Smith 2009 p. 47</ref> Maxtla similarly turned against the [[Acolhua]], and the king of Texcoco, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city, [[Tlacopan]]. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/>\n\nAfter the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and in 1430 <ref name=\"arqueologiamexicana.mx\"/>, the three remaining cities formed a treaty known today as the Triple Alliance.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/> The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. Tribute was to be divided so that two-fifths each went to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, and one-fifth went to Tlacopan. Each of the three kings of the alliance in turn assumed the title \"huetlatoani\" (\"Elder Speaker\", often translated as \"Emperor\"). In this role, each temporarily held a ''[[de jure]]'' position above the rulers of other city-states (\"tlatoani\").<ref name=\"Evans2008p460\">Evans 2008, p. 460</ref>\n\nIn the next 100 years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan came to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]]. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica ''huetlatoani'' in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created title of \"[[Cihuacoatl (position)|Cihuacoatl]]\", equivalent to something between \"Prime Minister\" and \"Viceroy\".<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/><ref>The term ''cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' literally means \"woman-snake\" or \"female snake\", and the origin of this designation is not well understood. The position was certainly not reserved for women, although the title may perhaps suggest a metaphoric dichotomy between the \"masculine\" ''Tlahto\u0101ni'' dealing with external imperial affairs and the \"feminine\" ''Cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' managing the domestic affairs.</ref>\n\n===Imperial reforms===\n[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar Warrior]], from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]\n\nShortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was \"not wise that all the people should know the paintings\".<ref name=\"Leon-Portilla1963p155\">Leon-Portilla 1963 p. 155</ref> Even if he did order such book-burnings, it was probably limited primarily to documents containing political propaganda from previous regimes; he thereafter rewrote the history of the Aztecs, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role. {{Citation needed|reason=How do we know the book-burnings were limited to \"propaganda\"? This is a serious historical claim that should be backed with a source.|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\">Smith 2009 p. 48</ref> Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\">Evans 2008 p. 462</ref> This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by ''calpixqueh'', or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nMoctezuma issued new laws that further separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\">Duran 1994, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> By royal decree, a religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\"/> Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a \"telpochcalli\" where they received basic religious instruction and military training.<ref name=\"Evans2008p456-457\">Evans 2008 pp. 456\u2013457</ref> A second, more prestigious type of school called a \"calmecac\" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called \"quauhpilli\" that could be conferred on commoners.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\"/> This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English [[knight]]). In some rare cases, commoners that received this title married into royal families and became kings.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nOne component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the [[flower war|Flower Wars]]. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice.<ref name=\"Evans2008p451\">Evans 2008, p. 451</ref> According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454.<ref name=\"Duran1994\">Duran 1994</ref> The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].\n\n===Early years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztecexpansion.png|thumb|450px|Map of the expansion of the empire, showing the areas conquered by the Aztec rulers.<ref>Based on Hassig 1988.</ref>]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl rapidly consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p47-48\">Smith 2009 pp. 47\u201348</ref> These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.\n\nOn the death of Itzcoatl, Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided.<ref>Smith 2009 p. 49</ref> Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into [[Oaxaca]]. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son, [[Axayacatl]]. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year-reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nAt the same time as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the [[Pur\u00e9pecha Empire]] in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Pur\u00e9pecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\">Pollard 1993, p. 169</ref> In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Pur\u00e9pecha attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Pur\u00e9pecha in battle again.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\">Smith 2009 p. 51</ref>\n\nIn 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died and his son [[Nezahualpilli]] was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco.<ref name=\"Evans2008p450\">Evans 2008, p. 450</ref> This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Axayacatl was replaced by his brother [[Tizoc]]. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Apparently due to his incompetence, Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/>\n\n===Later years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztec Empire 1519 map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire, according to Mar\u00eda del Carmen Solanes Carraro and Enrique Vela Ram\u00edrez.]]\n\nTizoc was succeeded by his brother [[Ahuitzotl]] in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the [[Oaxaca Valley]] and the [[Soconusco|Soconusco Coast]]. Due to increased border skirmishes with the Pur\u00e9pechas, Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\">Smith 2009 p. 54</ref> The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of [[Guerrero]].\n\nBy the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance.<ref>Smith 2009 pp. 50\u201351</ref> Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title \"huehuetlatoani\" (\"Eldest Speaker\") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Even though the alliance still technically ran the empire, the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.\n\nAhuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuzoma II]] in 1502. Moctezuma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire once again.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169-170\">Pollard 1993 pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding. The Pur\u00e9pechas defeated them and the army withdrew.\n\nMoctezuma II instituted more imperial reforms.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> After the death of Nezahualcoyotl, the Mexica Emperors had become the ''de facto'' rulers of the alliance. Moctezuma II used his reign to attempt to consolidate power more closely with the Mexica Emperor.<ref>Davies 1973 p. 216</ref> He removed many of Ahuitzotl's advisors and had several of them executed.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> He also abolished the \"quauhpilli\" class, destroying the chance for commoners to advance to the nobility. His reform efforts were cut short by the Spanish Conquest in 1519.\n\n===Spanish conquest===\n{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n[[File:Basin of Mexico 1519 map-en.svg|thumb|The [[Valley of Mexico]] at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish Conquest]].]]\n\nSpanish expedition leader [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] landed in Yucat\u00e1n in 1519 with approximately 630 men (most armed with only a sword and shield). Cort\u00e9s had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1squez]], but had stolen the boats and left without permission.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp35-40\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 35\u201340</ref> At the island of Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where after a brief battle with the local army, Cort\u00e9s was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter, Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cort\u00e9s a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named [[La Malinche]] (she was known also as Malinalli [mali\u02c8nal\u02d0i], Malintzin [ma\u02c8lintsin] or Do\u00f1a Marina [\u02c8do\u0272a ma\u02c8\u027eina] ). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Once Malinche learned Spanish, she became Cort\u00e9s's translator for both language and culture, and was a key figure in interactions with [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] rulers. An important article, \"Rethinking Malinche\" by [[Frances Karttunen]] examines her role in the conquest and beyond.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Rethinking Malinche\" in ''Indian Women of Early Mexico,'' Susan Schroeder, et al. eds. University of Oklahoma Press 1997.</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s then sailed from Campeche to [[Cempoala]], a tributary province of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Nearby, he founded the town of [[Veracruz]] where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor, [[Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin|Motecuzoma II]]. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cort\u00e9s went to Cempoala to meet with the local [[Totonac]] leaders. After the Totonac ruler told Cort\u00e9s of his various grievances against the Mexica, Cort\u00e9s convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp92-94\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 92\u201394</ref> Cort\u00e9s subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it. Having effectively declared war on the Aztecs, the Totonacs provided Cort\u00e9s with 20 companies of soldiers for his march to Tlaxcala.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003p120\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, p. 120</ref> At this time several of Cort\u00e9s's soldiers attempted to mutiny.

However, the Tlaxcalan general [[Xicotencatl the Younger]] believed them to be hostile, and attacked. After fighting several close battles, Cort\u00e9s eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cort\u00e9s then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala, and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs, in addition to the Spanish soldiers.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cort\u00e9s claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> In a pre-emptive response, Cort\u00e9s directed his troops attack and kill a large number of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.\n\nFollowing the massacre at Cholula, Hernan Cort\u00e9s and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\">Smith 2009 p. 275</ref> After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca. Cort\u00e9s claims that he used this incident as an excuse to take Motecuzoma prisoner under threat of force.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> For several months, Motecuzoma continued to run the kingdom as a prisoner of Hernan Cort\u00e9s. Then, in 1520, a second, larger Spanish expedition arrived under the command of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent by Diego Vel\u00e1squez with the goal of arresting Cort\u00e9s for treason.

In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian [[Alexander J. Motyl]] the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces; it merely expected tributes to be paid.<ref name=\"motyl\">{{cite book\n | last = Motyl\n | first = Alexander J.\n | title = Imperial Ends: The Decay, Collapse, and Revival of Empires\n | year = 2001\n | publisher = Columbia University Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-231-12110-5\n | pages = 13, 19\u201321, 32\u201336\n}}</ref> The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. not all of its dominated territories were connected by land. For example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The [[hegemonic]] nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC</ref>\n\nAlthough the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states (individually known as ''[[altepetl]]'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or ''tlatoani'' (literally \"speaker\", plural ''tlatoque'') from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. Even after the empire was formed in 1428 and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581\u2013595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered that the term \"Aztec empire\" is a modern one, not one used by the Aztec themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three [[Nahuatl]]-speaking city states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Over time, asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states, Tenochtitlan, above the other two. The \"Triple Alliance\" came to establish [[hegemony]] over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. Administration of the empire was performed through largely traditional, indirect means. However, over time something of a nascent [[bureaucracy]] may have been beginning to form insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.\n\n===Central administration===\n[[Image:Tlacochcalcatl.jpg|thumb|180px|A ''[[tlacochcalcatl]]'' pictured in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]\nBefore the reign of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] (1429\u20131472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., \"speakers\"), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' (lit., \"great speaker\") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with ''calpixque'' stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.<ref>\nEvans, Susan T. (2004). Ancient Mexico & Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. Thames & Hudson: New York, pp. 443\u2013446, 449\u2013451</ref>\n\nYet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the ''external'' issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the ''[[Cihuacoatl]]'' to govern a given city itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; [[Tlacaelel]], for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title \"Cihuacoatl\", which means \"female snake\" (it is the name of a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European [[Viceroy]] or [[Prime Minister]], reflect the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of Nahua [[cosmology]]. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the \"female\" wet season, those of the latter with the \"male\" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of [[Atzcapotzalco]], [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], and Tenochtitlan's ally [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.<ref>\nCoe, Michael D. (1984). Mexico, 3rd Ed.

Thames & Hudson: London, pp. 200\u2013202.\n</ref>\n\nEarly in the history of the empire, Tenochtitlan developed a four-member military and advisory Council which assisted the Huey tlatoani in his decision-making: the ''tlacochcalcatl''; the ''tlaccatecatl''; the ''ezhuahuacatl'';<ref name=\"BerdanAnawalt1992p196\">\nBerdan, Francis F. and Patricia Rieff Anawalt. 1992. The Codex Mendoza Vol. 1. University of California Press, p. 196</ref> and the ''tlillancalqui''. This design not only provided advise for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth [[Huey Tlatoani]] could only be selected from the Council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the Council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the ''cuauhchique'' (\"shorn ones\") and the ''otontin'' (\"[[Otomi (military)|Otomies]]\").<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M.

Thames & Hudson: London, p. 204.</ref>\n\n===Provincial administration===\nTraditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials. The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular ''calpixqui'', plural ''calpixque'') were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into tributary and strategic provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or ''huecalpixque'', whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the ''huetlatoani'', but rather by a separate position altogether: the ''petlacalcatl''. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, a military governor, or ''cuauhtlatoani'', was placed at the head of provincial supervision.<ref>Calnek, Edward E. (1982). Patterns of Empire Formation in the Valley of Mexico, in The Inca and Aztec States: 1400\u20131800. Collier, Rosaldo & Wirth (Eds.) Academic Press: New York, pp. 56\u201359</ref> During the reign of Moctezuma I, the calpixque system was elaborated, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. One was stationed in the province itself, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Tribute was drawn from commoners, the ''macehualtin'', and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (''tlatoque''), lesser rulers (''teteuctin''), or provincial nobility (''pipiltin'').<ref>Smith, Michael E. (1986). Social Stratification in the Aztec Empire: A View from the Provinces, in American Anthropologist,\n(88)1, p. 74</ref>\n\nTribute collection was supervised by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the ''pipiltin'' (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as ''pochteca''. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The power, political and economic, of the pochteca was strongly tied to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (''teucnenenque'', or \"travelers of the lord\") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], having administrative duties within their own [[Estates of the Realm|estate]].<ref>Kurtz, Donald V.

As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, it was Tenochtitlan which assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, it was Tenochtitlan which became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (2001). Religion and state in the Aztec Empire, in Empires (Alcock et al, Eds). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 284</ref>\n\nThough they were not described by the Aztec this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate [[client states]] which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under \"mutual consent\". Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.<ref name=Evans470-471>Evans, pp. 470\u2013471</ref><ref name=Smith1-2>Smith, Michael E.

''Tlatocayotl'', or the principle of rulership, established that this divine right was inherited by descent. Political order was therefore also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For that reason, whenever a tlatoani was killed or otherwise removed from their station, a relative and member of the same bloodline was typically placed in their stead. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, ''hueitlatocayotl'', standing in superior contrast to the lesser ''tlatocayotl'' principle.<ref>Almaz\u00e1n, pp. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\nExpansion of the empire was guided by a [[militaristic]] interpretation of Nahua religion, specifically a devout veneration of the sun god, [[Huitzilopochtli]].

It was under Tlacaelel that Huitzilopochtli assumed his elevated role in the state pantheon and who argued that it was through blood sacrifice that the Sun would be maintained and thereby stave off the end of the world. It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of [[human sacrifice]] under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.<ref>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel. (1963).

It was a formal written code, not merely a collection of customary practices. The sources for knowing about the legal code are colonial-era writings by Franciscan [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], Franciscan [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], and Texcocan historians [[Juan Bautista Pomar]], and [[Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilxochitl]]. The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, that is cases were tried by particular types of evidence and the social status of the litigants was disregarded, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.<ref>Offner, Jerome A. ''Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.81-82.</ref>\n\nMuch less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period.<ref>Offner, 1983, p. 83</ref> It was established under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, ''pochteca'' could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, [[Court-martial|military courts]] dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an [[appeal]] process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a [[supreme court]] and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the ''[[Huey tlatoani]]'', who had the right to appoint lesser judges.<ref>Kurtz, p. 307</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\n{{see also|Aztec emperors family tree}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Tenochtitlan\n!
