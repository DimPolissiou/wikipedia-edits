She is the [[Black hair|black-haired]] wife of [[caveman]] [[Barney Rubble]] and the adoptive mother of [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]. Her best friend is her next-door neighbor [[Wilma Flintstone]].\n\nBetty lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy primitive versions of modern conveniences such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s and [[washing machine]]s. She speaks with an Midwestern accent.\n\nBetty's personality was based on the [[stock character]] of the lead character's best friend's wife, commonly seen in 1950s television (other prominent examples including [[Trixie Norton]] of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', which by conflicting accounts was a major inspiration for ''The Flintstones'', and [[Ethel Mertz]] of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''). Much like Trixie or Ethel, Betty spent a lot of her time socializing with Wilma, and the two would often end up working together to bail their husbands out of whatever scheme of Fred's had landed them in trouble, sometimes scheming with each other.\n\n==Character==\nBetty is rarely seen failing to follow the lead of Barney or Wilma, so may appear to be the least developed character in the show. In spite of this, Betty is portrayed as having a distinctly emotional marriage with Barney, which often includes pet names and more obvious affection than the dynamic and energetic interaction between Fred and Wilma. Occasions when Betty leads the action are extremely scarce: one episode centers around her working undercover as a gentle old lady to earn money for a present for Barney; in another, the plot focuses on her and Wilma's suspicions of Barney being involved with another woman (who turns out to be Fred in a disguise in order to attend a ball game free of charge). This lack of protagonism (her continuous presence almost becoming a backdrop for supporting characters Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm and Dino) makes Betty less of the lead that the show's general concept might imply.\n\n==Biography==\nBetty is a friend of Wilma since their childhood. As a child, she lived with her parents who ran a [[convenience store]] and her older brother Brad. She also has a married sister  with a baby son named Marblehead Standstone<ref> \"The Surprise\"</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Betty and Wilma were employed as [[Cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girls]]/waitresses at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney. Eventually, Betty and Barney were married, presumably not long after Fred and Wilma.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>\n\nBetty became a [[homemaker]], keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby [[mammoth]] [[vacuum cleaner]], [[pelican]] [[washing machine]], and so forth. Betty, much like Wilma, also enjoyed volunteering for various charitable/women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and (occasionally) meeting the celebrities of their world, including \"[[Tony Curtis|Stony Curtis]]\", \"[[Cary Grant|Cary Granite]]\", and \"[[Ann-Margret#1960s|Ann-Margrock]]\". Betty at one time also had a job working for an 'old lady' who turned out to be a young lady in disguise and who was using Betty to pass counterfeit money; this was the only episode centered principally around Betty.<ref>\"Old Lady Betty,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Despite her cheerful nature she has occasions to be angry at Barney <ref>\"The Flintstone Flyer\"; \"The Diner\"; \"Peek a Boo camera\"</ref> and once knocked out crooks with her stone purse who tried to kill Barney<ref>The Soft Untouchables</ref>\n\nIn the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \"Bamm-Bamm.\" After a court battle for possession of Bamm-Bamm (in which the Rubbles faced the opposition's noted prehistoric lawyer \"[[Perry Mason]]ry\"), the couple were allowed to adopt Bamm-Bamm.<ref>\"Little Bamm-Bamm,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> The Rubbles never had biological children.\n\nWhen Bamm-Bamm was a teenager, Betty gained employment as a [[reporter]] for one of Bedrock's [[newspaper]]s, the ''Daily Granite'' (presumably a parody of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' of [[Superman]] fame), under the editorial guidance of Lou Granite (presumably a parody of [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] of the contemporaneous [[Lou Grant (TV series)|eponymous series]], and formerly of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''). While employed there, she shared various adventures with prehistoric [[superhero]] Captain Caveman, who (in a [[secret identity]]) also works for the newspaper.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" />\n\nLater still, after Bamm-Bamm grew up and left home, Betty started a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Wilma, before becoming a [[grandmother]] to Bamm-Bamm's twin children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[June Foray]] voiced Betty in a 1959 ''Flintstones'' pilot titled ''The Flagstones'', but [[Bea Benaderet]] was cast for the series and voiced Betty for the first 4 seasons before stepping down in 1964 (due to her scheduling conflicts with ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''). [[Gerry Johnson]] took over the role for the last 2 seasons. [[Anna Bentinck]] has since performed the role in later ''Flintstones'' media since 1990\u20132003.\n\nIn [[The Flintstones (film)|the 1994 film]], Betty was portrayed by [[Rosie O'Donnell]],<ref>{{cite news|title= ROSIE: She Cuts Through the Rubble and Tells It Straight Up: The Comic-Turned-Actress Is a Real-Life Rizzo Who Says What's on Her Mind |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-24|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-24/news/ol-37930_1_real-life|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A New Stage in Her Career: O'Donnell's Made It in Movies, but Broadway Was Her Dream |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-29|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-29/entertainment/ca-39836_1_movie-career/4|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref> who reportedly won the role because she captured the high pitch laugh at her audition.

Its creation was approved by a legislative act in Rwandan parliament in 2011. It is being constructed to handle 10,000 students from across the East Africa region, and its capacity expected to increase to 50,000 in 15 years. Construction of the University is being funded partly by the oversubscribed Euro bond sale in Rwanda, donations from the East African community at large, the [[Africa development bank]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and [[USAID]]. The University's curriculum is being developed in collaboration with the [[University of Nairobi]], [[University of Dar es Salaam]], and [[Makerere University]].\n\n==Campus==\nNorth Gate University is located about {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of [[Butare Town]]. The campus will include education facilities, housing facilities for both faculty and staff and a forest. It will be connected by railway to Kigali and neighboring countries [[Tanzania]] and [[Burundi]]\n\nThe campus is basically divided into two parts. There is the University Centre where the library, departmental offices, examination centre and resource centre are located, consisting of lecture theaters, workshops, and labs; and a second half consisting of the resident halls, hostels, and a football field.\n\n== Faculties ==\n*Faculty of [[Agriculture]]\n*Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n*Institute of [[Anthropology]]\n*Institute of Diplomacy And International Studies\n*Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology\n*School of Medicine\n*School of [[Biological Science]]s\n*School of [[Business]]\n*School of Continuing And Distance learning\n*School of Dental Sciences\n*School of [[Economics]]\n*School of [[Engineering]]\n*School of [[Mathematics]]\n*School of Nursing Sciences\n*School of Pharmacy\n*School of Physical Sciences\n*School of the Arts And Design\n*School of the Built Environment\n*Board of Post Graduate Studies\n*Center For International Programmes & Links\n\n=== Housing and sports facilities===\nNorth Gate University upon completion will have ten halls of residence, four of which houses female students. Off-campus housing will be also encouraged as Kigali-Butare Township will be able to provide affordable alternate options. Transport will be provided by the school to and from [[Kigali]] where some students will reside.

Its creation was approved by a legislative act in Rwandan parliament in 2011. It is being constructed to handle 10,000 students from across the East Africa region, and its capacity expected to increase to 50,000 in 15 years. Construction of the University is being funded partly by the oversubscribed Euro bond sale in Rwanda, donations from the East African community at large, the [[Africa development bank]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and [[USAID]]. The University's curriculum is being developed in collaboration with the [[University of Nairobi]], [[University of Dar es Salaam]], and [[Makerere University]].\n\n==Campus==\nNorth Gate University is located about {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of [[Butare Town]]. The campus will include education facilities, housing facilities for both faculty and staff and a forest. It will be connected by railway to Kigali and neighboring countries [[Tanzania]] and [[Burundi]]\n\nThe campus is basically divided into two parts. There is the University Centre where the library, departmental offices, examination centre and resource centre are located, consisting of lecture theaters, workshops, and labs; and a second half consisting of the resident halls, hostels, and a football field.\n\n== Faculties ==\n*Faculty of [[Agriculture]]\n*Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n*Institute of [[Anthropology]]\n*Institute of Diplomacy And International Studies\n*Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology\n*School of Medicine\n*School of [[Biological Science]]s\n*School of [[Business]]\n*School of Continuing And Distance learning\n*School of Dental Sciences\n*School of [[Economics]]\n*School of [[Engineering]]\n*School of [[Mathematics]]\n*School of Nursing Sciences\n*School of Pharmacy\n*School of Physical Sciences\n*School of the Arts And Design\n*School of the Built Environment\n*Board of Post Graduate Studies\n*Center For International Programmes & Links\n\n=== Housing and sports facilities===\nNorth Gate University upon completion will have ten halls of residence, four of which houses female students. Off-campus housing will be also encouraged as Kigali-Butare Township will be able to provide affordable alternate options.

{"title_page": "Norrington Table", "text_new": "{{short description|Table that ranks Oxford Colleges}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\nThe '''Norrington Table''' is an annual ranking of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|college]]s of the [[University of Oxford]] based on a score computed from the fraction of undergraduate students earning each of the various [[British undergraduate degree classification|degree classifications]] based on that year's [[final examination]]s.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe rankings of each college in the Norrington Table are calculated by awarding 5 points for a student who receives a First [[British undergraduate degree classification|Class degree]], 3 points for a 2:1, 2 for a 2:2 and 1 for a Third; the total is then divided by the maximum possible score (i.e. the number of finalists in that college multiplied by 5), and the result for each college is expressed as a percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places. Although the difference between the highest places on the table is usually very slight, the top colleges remain very competitive about their rankings in the Table. Their competitiveness has been heightened in recent years by increased media attention towards the rankings.\n\nPreviously the university had refused to endorse an official table, leading to inaccuracies (see [[Norrington Table#Criticisms|Criticisms]] below), so the university finally published its own rankings using examination results from all final year undergraduates in 2005.\n\n== History==\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Norrington Table was not created in 1962 by [[Arthur Lionel Pugh Norrington|Sir Arthur Norrington]], who was then president of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]].  Norrington did not invent the idea of producing a table of the results of [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford Colleges]].  Rather, he suggested a refinement to the weightings given to results by a pre-existing table.  Norrington's scoring system was suggested in 1963 and abandoned after 1985, owing to changes in the Oxford examination system.<ref>http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/exams</ref>\n\nOn 5 September 1963, Norrington had a letter published in ''[[The Times]]'', in which he objected to the table that their correspondent had invented two days earlier (3 September 1963, p.&nbsp;12).  ''The Times'' had previously published a table of Oxford Colleges' results in 1962 (29 August 1962, p.&nbsp;5).\n\nNorrington wrote: \"Your Correspondent has analysed the final examination results this year and gives an order of merit, among the first colleges, based on the percentage of Firsts and Seconds.  This, in effect, is the same as basing it on the percentage of Thirds, and gives it no extra credit for Firsts.  College A, for example, that gets 20 Firsts, 60 Seconds, and 20 Thirds scores less by this method than College B that gets no Firsts, 81 Seconds and 19 Thirds, but surely A has, in reality, done much better than B.  A better result, I submit, is obtained by a points system in which a First scores more than a second and a Second more than a Third.  If you make the points 3, 2, and 1 respectively and calculate what percentage of its \"possible\" each college has secured, you will find that College A, with 200 points out of 300, has scored 66.67 per cent, and B, with 181, only 60 per cent.  This method of calculation will be found to promote Magdalen and Merton, which come surprisingly low in your Correspondent's order.\"  (5 September 1963, p.&nbsp;13)\n\nIn 1986, when Oxford for the first time split Second Class honours into Upper Seconds and Lower Seconds, ''The Times'' unilaterally adopted the [[Tompkins Table]], which gives more weight to a First class degree: five points for a First, three for a 2.1, two for a 2.2, and one for a Third.  This system was invented in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, of [[Birkenhead]], as a method of classifying the results of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] colleges, and a table compiled by Tompkins on this basis was published on 28 August by ''The Times'' (28 Aug 1981, p.&nbsp;10) alongside a table using the Norrington scoring system, which had been compiled by the ''[[Cambridge Evening News]]''.  The Tompkins Table became the preferred rating for [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge colleges]] and has prevailed for Oxford colleges, too, since 1986.\n\n=== Recent rankings ===\nBelow is the Norrington Table for the [[academic year]] 2018/19 along with mean values of the period 2006 to 2019<ref name=\"ox.ac.uk\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!College/<br>Hall\n!2019 Score<br>%\n!Mean Score<br>(2006-2019)<br>%\n|-\n|[[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]]\n|78.82\n|75.60\n|-\n|[[New College, Oxford|New College]]\n|77.90\n|74.65\n|-\n|[[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]]\n|77.71\n|75.42\n|-\n|[[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]]\n|77.64\n|70.46\n|-\n|[[Mansfield College, Oxford|Mansfield]]\n|76.88\n|68.44\n|-\n|[[St John's College, Oxford|St John's]]\n|76.83\n|74.49\n|-\n|[[Ripon College Cuddesdon|Ripon]]\n|76.67\n|64.18\n|-\n|[[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's]]\n|76.43\n|69.90\n|-\n|[[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]]\n|75.40\n|69.54\n|-\n|[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]\n|74.67\n|72.62\n|-\n|[[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus]]\n|74.42\n|71.26\n|-\n|[[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester]]\n|73.85\n|65.90\n|-\n|[[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]]\n|73.82\n|71.00\n|-\n|[[University College, Oxford|University]]\n|73.80\n|70.85\n|-\n|[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]\n|73.39\n|72.02\n|-\n|[[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford]]\n|73.39\n|70.39\n|-\n|[[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]]\n|73.21\n|70.81\n|-\n|[[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke]]\n|73.08\n|69.03\n|-\n|[[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]\n|72.79\n|67.99\n|-\n|[[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]]\n|72.77\n|69.09\n|-\n|[[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]]\n|72.76\n|71.91\n|-\n|[[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln]]\n|72.73\n|71.06\n|-\n|[[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]]\n|72.65\n|68.27\n|-\n|[[Keble College, Oxford|Keble]]\n|72.64\n|69.65\n|-\n|[[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester]]\n|72.58\n|71.52\n|-\n|[[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's]]\n|72.47\n|67.94\n|-\n|[[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]]\n|73.38\n|71.30\n|-\n|[[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]]\n|72.35\n|68.11\n|-\n|[[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]]\n|70.66\n|69.51\n|-\n|[[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]]\n|70.27\n|68.08\n|-\n|[[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's]]\n|69.38\n|68.55\n|-\n|[[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford|Wycliffe Hall]]\n|66.15\n|67.43\n|-\n|[[Regent's Park College, Oxford|Regent's Park]]\n|63.53\n|64.13\n|-\n|[[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]]\n|63.08\n|62.76\n|-\n|[[St Stephen's House, Oxford|St Stephen's House]]\n|60.00\n|59.46\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Past rankings ===\nNorrington Table rankings from 2006 to 2016 by college, ordered by mean score (note that Campion Hall hardly ever has any undergraduates):<ref name=\"ox.ac.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/undergraduate-degree-classifications|title=Undergraduate Degree Classifications {{!}} University of Oxford|website=www.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Norrington_Table.svg]]\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe table is biased towards colleges with above average proportions of students in science subjects such as chemistry and mathematics,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stokes|first1=Matt|last2=Lewis|first2=Alis|last3=Restall|first3=James|title=Merton plummet in latest Norrington Table|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/08/16/magdalen-top-dogs-in-norrington-table/|website=The Oxford Student|accessdate=16 June 2017|date=16 August 2012}}</ref> for which a higher proportion attain a First Class degree compared to humanities (for which more students attain a 2.1).

Based on the sport of [[demolition derby]], the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented [[Game physics|simulated physics]] to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small to increase the number of wrecks. Versions of ''Destruction Derby'' were released for [[MS-DOS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]]. A [[Nintendo 64]] version, ''Destruction Derby 64'', was released in 1999 by [[Looking Glass Studios]] and [[THQ]]. Critics found ''Destruction Derby'' enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It does not work fully on all [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]] models due to game save file issues. The game started the ''Destruction Derby'' franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, ''[[Destruction Derby 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Destructionderby3.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The player engages in a Destruction Derby contest at The Bowl.]]\n''Destruction Derby'' is a [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] [[racing video game]] based on the sport of [[demolition derby]].<ref name=cgw /><ref name=booklet>{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=Huw | title=''Destruction Derby'' MS-DOS manual | publisher=[[Psygnosis]] | date=1996 }}</ref> The game contains three vehicles.<ref name=elecplay /> Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed.<ref name=pcgamer /><ref name=gamefan1>{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Matt | title=''Destruction Derby'' | volume=3 | issue=7 | date=July 1995 | journal=[[GameFan]] | pages=70, 71 }}</ref> Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's [[radiator]], which causes the car to overheat and stop running.<ref name=pcgamer /> Four [[Game mechanics#Game modes|game modes]] are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial.

Director Martin Edmondson believed that the game would otherwise be \"completely unplayable\", as with \"[[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] when the collisions are all off\". Producer Tony Parks noted that the physics were simplified to improve performance and to compensate for the PlayStation's [[PlayStation Controller|digital controller]], and that the team sought a balance between \"realism and playability\".

He believed that its \"graphics are almost all you could want for a game\" of this type, but wrote that \"nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular\". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, \"Limited options keep ''Destruction Derby'' out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun.\"<ref name=gamepro>{{cite magazine | author=Captain Squideo | title=''Destruction Derby'' | issue=86 | magazine=[[GamePro]] | date=November 1995 | page=54 }}</ref> [[Victor Lucas (television producer)|Victor Lucas]] of ''[[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]]'' stated that \"the beauty of the game\" is the strategy involved in making \"calculated strikes\" against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, \"If you go all out and try to make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds.\" He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode \"is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either ''Wipeout'' or ''Ridge Racer''\", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were \"most fun to be had\" in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, \"''Destruction Derby'' is a winner in every capacity.\"<ref name=elecplay /> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably \"lacking\" but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.<ref name=\"NGen11\"/>\n\nThe PC port was also well-received. Lee Buchanan of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' praised \"the spectacular visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've seen on a computer\", and he noted that \"[car] damage is depicted beautifully\". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player \"can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction\". Although he found the game too easy \"even at the toughest difficulty level\", he found this to be a minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, \"''Destruction Derby'' is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations.\"<ref name=pcgamer /> Peter Olafson of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called the game \"a great simulation\" of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are \"convulsive and realistic\". He believed that the game \"has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives\", and he considered the car damage to be \"especially marvelous\u2014and unprecedented for this sort of game\". However, he found that its \"useful life span is surprisingly short\" and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, \"Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential.\"<ref name=cgw>{{cite journal | last=Olafson | first=Peter | title=Car Wars | issue=139 | date=February 1996 | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=68, 70, 72, 254 }}</ref> A reviewer for ''Next Generation'' remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that it can be difficult to see nearby cars.<ref name=\"NGen14\"/>\n\nReviewing the game's Sega Saturn version, Kim Randell of ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' noted its \"inferior graphics\" that do not have \"the sheen and glossiness of its PlayStation counterpart\". Randell believed that it was made \"much too late to cause the kind of sensation that ''WipEout'' did. Comparisons with the PlayStation version are inevitable, and the rather haphazard conversion means that the Saturn version lacks the polish of its rival.\"<ref name=cvg /> Rob Allsetter's review in ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' (from the same publisher as ''Computer & Video Games'') recycled most of the text from Randell's review, including the closing remarks.<ref name=\"SatMag12\"/> Erik Reppen of ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that it \"doesn't seem fair to compare\" the Nintendo 64 release to the PlayStation version, and he complained that car damage does not hinder performance. He said that it would more accurately be described as \"''Destruction Derby'' Arcade\".

Based on the sport of [[demolition derby]], the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented [[Game physics|simulated physics]] to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small to increase the number of wrecks. Versions of ''Destruction Derby'' were released for [[MS-DOS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]]. A [[Nintendo 64]] version, ''Destruction Derby 64'', was released in 1999 by [[Looking Glass Studios]] and [[THQ]]. Critics found ''Destruction Derby'' enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It does not work fully on all [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]] models due to game save file issues. The game started the ''Destruction Derby'' franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, ''[[Destruction Derby 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Destructionderby3.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The player engages in a Destruction Derby contest at The Bowl.]]\n''Destruction Derby'' is a [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] [[racing video game]] based on the sport of [[demolition derby]].<ref name=cgw /><ref name=booklet>{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=Huw | title=''Destruction Derby'' MS-DOS manual | publisher=[[Psygnosis]] | date=1996 }}</ref> The game contains three vehicles.<ref name=elecplay /> Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed.<ref name=pcgamer /><ref name=gamefan1>{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Matt | title=''Destruction Derby'' | volume=3 | issue=7 | date=July 1995 | journal=[[GameFan]] | pages=70, 71 }}</ref> Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's [[radiator]], which causes the car to overheat and stop running.<ref name=pcgamer /> Four [[Game mechanics#Game modes|game modes]] are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial.

Director Martin Edmondson believed that the game would otherwise be \"completely unplayable\", as with \"[[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] when the collisions are all off\". Producer Tony Parks noted that the physics were simplified to improve performance and to compensate for the PlayStation's [[PlayStation Controller|digital controller]], and that the team sought a balance between \"realism and playability\". Performance was also improved by [[Program optimization|optimising]] the game's graphics, and by reducing the [[level of detail]] of objects in the [[Draw distance|distance]]. ''Destruction Derby''{{'}}s [[game engine]] supports up to twenty cars on screen simultaneously, which no console racing game, other than ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'', had achieved until that time.

He believed that its \"graphics are almost all you could want for a game\" of this type, but wrote that \"nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular\". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, \"Limited options keep ''Destruction Derby'' out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun.\"<ref name=gamepro>{{cite magazine | author=Captain Squideo | title=''Destruction Derby'' | issue=86 | magazine=[[GamePro]] | date=November 1995 | page=54 }}</ref> [[Victor Lucas (television producer)|Victor Lucas]] of ''[[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]]'' stated that \"the beauty of the game\" is the strategy involved in making \"calculated strikes\" against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, \"If you go all out and try to make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds.\" He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode \"is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either ''Wipeout'' or ''Ridge Racer''\", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were \"most fun to be had\" in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, \"''Destruction Derby'' is a winner in every capacity.\"<ref name=elecplay /> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably \"lacking\" but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.<ref name=\"NGen11\"/>\n\nThe PC port was also well-received. Lee Buchanan of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' praised \"the spectacular visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've seen on a computer\", and he noted that \"[car] damage is depicted beautifully\". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player \"can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction\". Although he found the game too easy \"even at the toughest difficulty level\", he found this to be a minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, \"''Destruction Derby'' is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations.\"<ref name=pcgamer /> Peter Olafson of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called the game \"a great simulation\" of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are \"convulsive and realistic\". He believed that the game \"has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives\", and he considered the car damage to be \"especially marvelous\u2014and unprecedented for this sort of game\". However, he found that its \"useful life span is surprisingly short\" and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, \"Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential.\"<ref name=cgw>{{cite journal | last=Olafson | first=Peter | title=Car Wars | issue=139 | date=February 1996 | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=68, 70, 72, 254 }}</ref> A reviewer for ''Next Generation'' remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that it can be difficult to see nearby cars.<ref name=\"NGen14\"/>\n\nReviewing the game's Sega Saturn version, Kim Randell of ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' noted its \"inferior graphics\" that do not have \"the sheen and glossiness of its PlayStation counterpart\". Randell believed that it was made \"much too late to cause the kind of sensation that ''WipEout'' did. Comparisons with the PlayStation version are inevitable, and the rather haphazard conversion means that the Saturn version lacks the polish of its rival.\"<ref name=cvg /> Rob Allsetter's review in ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' (from the same publisher as ''Computer & Video Games'') recycled most of the text from Randell's review, including the closing remarks.<ref name=\"SatMag12\"/> Erik Reppen of ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that it \"doesn't seem fair to compare\" the Nintendo 64 release to the PlayStation version, and he complained that car damage does not hinder performance. He said that it would more accurately be described as \"''Destruction Derby'' Arcade\". He found that the game was far too easy for \"experienced racers and big fans of the franchise\" to enjoy, and finished, \"It was fun, but I wouldn't buy it.\"<ref name=gameinformer /> Aaron Boulding of [[IGN]] believed that ''Destruction Derby 64'' came too long after the original version, and that it was \"a shadow of the outdated PSX game\". He complained about the \"bland backgrounds and flat textures\" and noted that the graphics are \"grainy\" and suffer from slowdown; but he enjoyed the car damage visuals.

Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that \"the slowdown when all four join in is minima[l]\u2014nice programming on the part of Looking Glass\".

As the eldest daughter of the deceased [[Despot of Serbia]] [[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], the 12-year-old Helena was given in marriage to the Bosnian prince [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1459. She then took the name Maria, while her husband obtained the title to [[Despotate of Serbia|Serbia]] through her. The country was lost to the [[Ottomans]] within a few months, and the couple fled to [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]]. Maria's husband ascended the Bosnian throne in 1461, but two years later the kingdom too fell to the Ottomans and he was executed. The widowed queen avoided capture by fleeing to the coast. Having spent a few years in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and possibly Hungary, Maria settled in [[Ottoman Greece]] at the court of her aunts [[Mara Brankovi\u0107|Mara]] and [[Katarina Brankovi\u0107|Kantakouzene]]. Her string of conflicts and legal disputes with Kantakouzene, the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Athonite monasteries]] earned her an ill reputation, with the monks describing her as an \"evil woman\".\n\n== Youth ==\n[[File:Serbian Despotate about 1450.png|thumb|The decline of the Serbian Despotate in the late 1450s]]\nMaria was the eldest of three children born to [[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], son of the [[Despot of Serbia]] [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]], and his wife, [[Helena Palaiologina of Morea|Helena Palaiologina]].

Following the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|Ottoman invasion in May 1463]], the royal family appears to have decided to split and flee towards the neighbouring [[Croatia proper|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] in different directions to confuse and mislead the attackers.{{sfn|Regan|2010|p=19}} King Stephen, who had sent Maria to Dalmatia along with Saint Luke's relics, was captured and executed. The two queens, Maria and Catherine, were the only members of the royal family to escape the invaders and both eventually reached the territories of the [[Republic of Ragusa]].{{sfn|Regan|2010|p=20}} The 16th century chronicler [[Mavro Orbini]] wrote that Queen Maria was captured by the [[Ban of Croatia]], [[Pavao \u0160piran\u010di\u0107]], during her journey to the coast,{{sfn|Regan|2010|p=20}} but this is unlikely because Pavao himself was in Turkish captivity around that time.{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=44}}{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=215}}\n\n== Years of wandering ==\n\nMaria, in her haste to avoid falling into Ottoman hands, mislaid the relics of Saint Luke. [[Bosnian Franciscan]] friars retrieved them and headed towards Ragusa, but were intercepted in [[Poljice, Dubrovnik-Neretva County|Poljice]] by [[Ivani\u0161 Vlatkovi\u0107]], a local nobleman and friend of the Queen, who refused to let them pass without her permission. This angered Ragusa, which demanded that Ivani\u0161 surrender the relics to them.{{sfn|Fine|1975|p=331}} On 9 July, the republic's authorities issued a decree allowing the Queen to take refuge on one of their islands. The decree also made reference to an important issue the Ragusans wanted to discuss with her, most likely the sale of the relics.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=214}} The [[Republic of Venice]] also expressed interest in Maria's heirloom, but she was gravely offended in August when Venetian authorities miserly tried to question the authenticity of the relics.{{sfn|Fine|1975|p=331}} The Venetians eventually succeeded in concluding a sale through her deputy, Ivani\u0161 Vlatkovi\u0107.{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=45-50}} She regretted the transaction after the Hungarian king [[Matthias Corvinus]] offered her three or four towns in exchange for the relics, but her attempt to have Ivani\u0161 retrieve them in late August failed.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=214}} Both Ivani\u0161 and Maria were rewarded by Venice, with the Queen being allowed to settle in the Benedictine [[Monastery of St. Stephen under the Pines]] near [[Spalato]].{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=216}}{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=49}}\n\nWhile residing in the monastery, Queen Maria received visits from Bosnians and Hungarians that made the Venetian authorities grow suspicious. They soon instructed the government of Spalato to recommend moving her to [[Sebenico]] or to an island on the grounds of poor living conditions in the monastery, with the intention of permanently removing her from their territory.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=216}} Unlike her stepmother-in-law (and even the Hungarian king), the 16-year-old Queen Maria refrained from claiming the patrimony of Bosnian kings during her exile in Dalmatia and Ragusa.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=217}}\n\nPossibly having spent some time in Hungary after leaving Dalmatia, Queen Maria settled in [[Ottoman Greece]]. She probably joined her paternal aunts, [[Mara Brankovi\u0107|Mara]] (Mehmed's esteemed and influential stepmother) and [[Katarina Brankovi\u0107|Kantakouzene]], on their estate near [[Serres]].{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=217}} A conflict which erupted in 1476 between Maria and Kantakouzene led to the latter's brief imprisonment after the Queen complained to Mehmed.{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=52}} The strife may have caused the Queen to move to [[Constantinople]], the Ottoman capital, where she enjoyed protection of Mehmed and his successor, [[Bayezid II]]. She spent years \"slandering and intriguing against her closest relatives\",{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=224}} as well as suing everyone from whom she could profit.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=218}}\n\n== Lawsuits and frauds ==\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Mara Brankovi\u0107, Esphigmenou charter (1429).jpg\n | width1 = 130\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Katarina Esfigmen.jpg\n | width2 = 190\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Maria's aunts Mara and Kantakouzene\n}}\nIn October 1484, Queen Maria approached the [[Sublime Porte]] to ask for the Sultan's help in reclaiming a third of her paternal grandfather's deposit in Ragusa, which she insisted had not been returned to her father. Bayezid wrote to Ragusa and sent an envoy to bring the gold, but the Ragusans responded with a letter proving that the deposit had been returned to Lazar. Maria, however, disputed the authenticity of her father's seal, and Bayezid sided with her.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=218}} It is not known whether the Ragusans obeyed Bayezid's command to send the gold to the Queen, but there is plenty of evidence against her allegations in the letters of her father and uncle.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}}\n\nUpon the deaths of her aunts Mara and Kantakouzene in 1487 and 1490 respectively, Maria inherited their possessions in accordance with the [[Sharia law]]. She immediately launched a claim to [[icons]] left by Mara to the monastery of [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. Since her sex [[Avaton|precluded]] her from accessing the holy mountain, it took Bayezid's intervention in 1492 for her to receive the icons. Shortly afterwards she called to Sharia court the monks of [[Xeropotamou Monastery]], alleging that one of them stole money from her aunt Kantakouzene while in her service, but could not prove this.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}}\n\nIn {{circa}} 1495, Maria became involved in another legal dispute with Ragusa, this time concerning the [[tribute of Ston]]. The tribute had been paid by Ragusa to Serbian rulers since the reign of [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], but the income was ceded to the [[Monastery of Saint Archangels Michael and Gabriel]] in Jerusalem. Mara reclaimed the income after the monastery was closed, and after her death it was managed by Kantakouzene. Maria decided to claim it as her aunts' legal heir, but the Athonite monasteries of [[Chilandar]] and [[Agiou Pavlou monastery|Saint Paul's]] cited her aunts' non-formalized bequest.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}} Queen Maria, described straightforwardly by the monks as an \"evil woman\", died {{circa}} 1500, when Chilandar and Saint Paul's were recorded as having secured the income.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=220}} She is believed to have died in [[\u00c7orlu]] and to have been buried in a local church along with her maternal uncle, [[Manuel Palaiologos]].{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2002|p=60}}\n\nIt is not clear why Maria enjoyed such strong support of the sultans in her various conflicts and plain frauds. An explanation might be offered by the narrative of her relative [[Theodore Spandounes]], who lived for some time with her aunts and whose family maintained close relations with the Brankovi\u0107 dynasty. He wrote that Queen Maria married a ''[[sipahi]]'' with whom she had no children, but went so far as to claim that she was captured by the Turks in Bosnia and forced into the marriage, which is evidently untrue.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=221}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{tree chart/start|align=center}}\n{{tree chart|border=0| | | | | | |\u0110uro|y|Jerina| | | |Tom|y|Kate| | | |\u0110uro=[[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]]|Jerina=[[Irene Kantakouzene]]|Tom=[[Thomas Palaiologos]]|Kate=[[Caterina Zaccaria]]}}\n{{tree chart|border=0| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{tree chart|border=0|Murad|~|Mara| |Kantakuzina| |Lazar|y|Jelica| |Manuel| |Toma|~|Kata| | | | | | | | |Lazar=[[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]]|Jelica=[[Helena Palaiologina, Despotess of Serbia|Helena Palaiologina]]|Toma=[[Toma\u0161 Kotromani\u0107]]|Manuel=[[Manuel Palaiologos]]|Mara=[[Mara Brankovi\u0107]]|Kantakuzina=[[Kantakouzene Brankovi\u0107]]|Kata=[[Katarina Kosa\u010da]]|Murad=[[Murad II]]}}\n{{tree chart|border=0| |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{tree chart|border=0|Mehmed| | | | | | | | | | | |Mara|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|Stjepko| | | | | | | | | | | |Mara='''Marija/Jelena Brankovi\u0107'''|Stjepko=[[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 of Bosnia|Stjepan Kotromani\u0107]]|Mehmed=[[Mehmed II]]}}\n{{tree chart|border=0| |!| |}}\n{{tree chart|border=0|Bayezid| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Bayezid=[[Bayezid II]]}}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Babinger|first=Franz|author-link=Franz Babinger|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=USA|year=1992|isbn=0-691-01078-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp, Jr.|author-link=John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|title=The Bosnian Church: Its Place in State and Society from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century|publisher=Saqi|year=1975|isbn=0914710036|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bosnianchurchnew0000fine}}\n*{{citation|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472082604|year=1994}}\n*{{citation|title=\u017divotni put posljednje bosanske kraljice Mare nakon propasti Bosanskog kraljevstva|work=Radovi|last= Mahini\u0107|first=Senja|publisher=Filozofski fakultet u Sarajevu|year=2014|language=Serbo-Croatian}}\n*{{citation|title=Posljednja bosanska kraljica Mara (Jelena)|work=Zbornik za istoriju Bosne i Hercegovine 2|last= To\u0161i\u0107|first=\u0110uro|publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|year=2002|language=Serbo-Croatian|pages=29\u201360}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-hou|name=Maria of Serbia|[[Brankovi\u0107 dynasty]]||1447||1498|}}\n{{S-roy|}}\n{{S-bef|before=[[Catherine of St Sava]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[Queen consort of Bosnia]]|years=1461 \u2013 1463}}\n{{S-non|rows=2|reason=Ottoman conquest}}\n|-\n{{S-vac|last=[[Helena Palaiologina of the Morea|Helena Palaiologina]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[List of Serbian consorts|Despoina consort of Serbia]]|years=1459}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{House of Kotromani\u0107}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brankovic, Jelena (Marija)}}\n[[Category:1447 births]]\n[[Category:1490s deaths]]\n[[Category:Bosnian queens|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Medieval Serbian royal consorts|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Kotromani\u0107 dynasty|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Brankovi\u0107 dynasty|Maria]]\n[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy]]\n[[Category:Medieval Serbian people of Greek descent]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Infobox royalty\n|consort=yes\n|name=Maria of Serbia\n|succession=[[List of Bosnian consorts|Queen consort of Bosnia]]\n|succession1=[[Serbian Despotate|Despoina consort of Serbia]]\n|image=\n|caption=\n|reign=10 July 1461 \u2013 5 June 1463\n|reign1=1 April 1459 \u2013 20 June 1459\n|spouse=[[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]], [[King of Bosnia]]\n|house=[[Brankovi\u0107 dynasty|Brankovi\u0107]]\n|father=[[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], [[Despot of Serbia]]\n|mother=[[Helena Palaiologina of Morea|Helena Palaiologina]]\n|birth_date={{circa}} 1447\n|birth_place=[[Smederevo]], [[Despotate of Serbia|Serbia]]\n|death_date={{circa}} 1500\n|death_place= [[\u00c7orlu]], [[Ottoman Empire]]\n|}}\n'''Maria of Serbia''' ({{lang-sh|Mara Brankovi\u0107}}/\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; {{circa}} 1447 \u2013 {{circa}} 1500), christened '''Helena''' (''Jelena''/\u0408\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430), was the last [[Queen consort of Bosnia|Queen of Bosnia]] and [[List of Serbian consorts|Despoina of Serbia]].

The decree also made reference to an important issue the Ragusans wanted to discuss with her, most likely the sale of the relics.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=214}} The [[Republic of Venice]] also expressed interest in Maria's heirloom, but she was gravely offended in August when Venetian authorities miserly tried to question the authenticity of the relics.{{sfn|Fine|1975|p=331}} The Venetians eventually succeeded in concluding a sale through her deputy, Ivani\u0161 Vlatkovi\u0107.{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=45-50}} She regretted the transaction after the Hungarian king [[Matthias Corvinus]] offered her three or four towns in exchange for the relics, but her attempt to have Ivani\u0161 retrieve them in late August failed.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=214}} Both Ivani\u0161 and Maria were rewarded by Venice, with the Queen being allowed to settle in the Benedictine [[Monastery of St. Stephen under the Pines]] near [[Spalato]].{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=216}}{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=49}}\n\nWhile residing in the monastery, Queen Maria received visits from Bosnians and Hungarians that made the Venetian authorities grow suspicious. They soon instructed the government of Spalato to recommend moving her to [[Sebenico]] or to an island on the grounds of poor living conditions in the monastery, with the intention of permanently removing her from their territory.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=216}} Unlike her stepmother-in-law (and even the Hungarian king), the 16-year-old Queen Maria refrained from claiming the patrimony of Bosnian kings during her exile in Dalmatia and Ragusa.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=217}}\n\nPossibly having spent some time in Hungary after leaving Dalmatia, Queen Maria settled in [[Ottoman Greece]]. She probably joined her paternal aunts, [[Mara Brankovi\u0107|Mara]] (Mehmed's esteemed and influential stepmother) and [[Katarina Brankovi\u0107|Kantakouzene]], on their estate near [[Serres]].{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=217}} A conflict which erupted in 1476 between Maria and Kantakouzene led to the latter's brief imprisonment after the Queen complained to Mehmed.{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2014|p=52}} The strife may have caused the Queen to move to [[Constantinople]], the Ottoman capital, where she enjoyed protection of Mehmed and his successor, [[Bayezid II]]. She spent years \"slandering and intriguing against her closest relatives\",{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=224}} as well as suing everyone from whom she could profit.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=218}}\n\n== Lawsuits and frauds ==\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Mara Brankovi\u0107, Esphigmenou charter (1429).jpg\n | width1 = 130\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Katarina Esfigmen.jpg\n | width2 = 190\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Maria's aunts Mara and Kantakouzene\n}}\nIn October 1484, Queen Maria approached the [[Sublime Porte]] to ask for the Sultan's help in reclaiming a third of her paternal grandfather's deposit in Ragusa, which she insisted had not been returned to her father. Bayezid wrote to Ragusa and sent an envoy to bring the gold, but the Ragusans responded with a letter proving that the deposit had been returned to Lazar. Maria, however, disputed the authenticity of her father's seal, and Bayezid sided with her.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=218}} It is not known whether the Ragusans obeyed Bayezid's command to send the gold to the Queen, but there is plenty of evidence against her allegations in the letters of her father and uncle.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}}\n\nUpon the deaths of her aunts Mara and Kantakouzene in 1487 and 1490 respectively, Maria inherited their possessions in accordance with the [[Sharia law]]. She immediately launched a claim to [[icons]] left by Mara to the monastery of [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. Since her sex [[Avaton|precluded]] her from accessing the holy mountain, it took Bayezid's intervention in 1492 for her to receive the icons. Shortly afterwards she called to Sharia court the monks of [[Xeropotamou Monastery]], alleging that one of them stole money from her aunt Kantakouzene while in her service, but could not prove this.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}}\n\nIn {{circa}} 1495, Maria became involved in another legal dispute with Ragusa, this time concerning the [[tribute of Ston]]. The tribute had been paid by Ragusa to Serbian rulers since the reign of [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], but the income was ceded to the [[Monastery of Saint Archangels Michael and Gabriel]] in Jerusalem. Mara reclaimed the income after the monastery was closed, and after her death it was managed by Kantakouzene. Maria decided to claim it as her aunts' legal heir, but the Athonite monasteries of [[Chilandar]] and [[Agiou Pavlou monastery|Saint Paul's]] cited her aunts' non-formalized bequest.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=219}} Queen Maria, described straightforwardly by the monks as an \"evil woman\", died {{circa}} 1500, when Chilandar and Saint Paul's were recorded as having secured the income.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=220}} She is believed to have died in [[\u00c7orlu]] and to have been buried in a local church along with her maternal uncle, [[Manuel Palaiologos]].{{sfn|To\u0161i\u0107|2002|p=60}}\n\nIt is not clear why Maria enjoyed such strong support of the sultans in her various conflicts and plain frauds. An explanation might be offered by the narrative of her relative [[Theodore Spandounes]], who lived for some time with her aunts and whose family maintained close relations with the Brankovi\u0107 dynasty. He wrote that Queen Maria married a ''[[sipahi]]'' with whom she had no children, but went so far as to claim that she was captured by the Turks in Bosnia and forced into the marriage, which is evidently untrue.{{sfn|Mahini\u0107|2014|p=221}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{family tree/start|align=center}}\n{{familytree|border=0| | | | | | |\u0110uro|y|Jerina| | | |Tom|y|Kate| | | |\u0110uro=[[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]]|Jerina=[[Irene Kantakouzene]]|Tom=[[Thomas Palaiologos]]|Kate=[[Caterina Zaccaria]]}}\n{{familytree|border=0| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree|border=0|Murad|~|Mara| |Kantakuzina| |Lazar|y|Jelica| |Manuel| |Toma|~|Kata| | | | | | | | |Lazar=[[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]]|Jelica=[[Helena Palaiologina, Despotess of Serbia|Helena Palaiologina]]|Toma=[[Toma\u0161 Kotromani\u0107]]|Manuel=[[Manuel Palaiologos]]|Mara=[[Mara Brankovi\u0107]]|Kantakuzina=[[Kantakouzene Brankovi\u0107]]|Kata=[[Katarina Kosa\u010da]]|Murad=[[Murad II]]}}\n{{familytree|border=0| |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree|border=0|Mehmed| | | | | | | | | | | |Mara|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|Stjepko| | | | | | | | | | | |Mara='''Marija/Jelena Brankovi\u0107'''|Stjepko=[[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 of Bosnia|Stjepan Kotromani\u0107]]|Mehmed=[[Mehmed II]]}}\n{{familytree|border=0| |!| |}}\n{{familytree|border=0|Bayezid| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Bayezid=[[Bayezid II]]}}\n{{Family tree/end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Babinger|first=Franz|author-link=Franz Babinger|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=USA|year=1992|isbn=0-691-01078-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp, Jr.|author-link=John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|title=The Bosnian Church: Its Place in State and Society from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century|publisher=Saqi|year=1975|isbn=0914710036|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bosnianchurchnew0000fine}}\n*{{citation|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472082604|year=1994}}\n*{{citation|title=\u017divotni put posljednje bosanske kraljice Mare nakon propasti Bosanskog kraljevstva|work=Radovi|last= Mahini\u0107|first=Senja|publisher=Filozofski fakultet u Sarajevu|year=2014|language=Serbo-Croatian}}\n*{{citation|title=Posljednja bosanska kraljica Mara (Jelena)|work=Zbornik za istoriju Bosne i Hercegovine 2|last= To\u0161i\u0107|first=\u0110uro|publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|year=2002|language=Serbo-Croatian|pages=29\u201360}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-hou|name=Maria of Serbia|[[Brankovi\u0107 dynasty]]||1447||1498|}}\n{{S-roy|}}\n{{S-bef|before=[[Catherine of St Sava]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[Queen consort of Bosnia]]|years=1461 \u2013 1463}}\n{{S-non|rows=2|reason=Ottoman conquest}}\n|-\n{{S-vac|last=[[Helena Palaiologina of the Morea|Helena Palaiologina]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[List of Serbian consorts|Despoina consort of Serbia]]|years=1459}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{House of Kotromani\u0107}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brankovic, Jelena (Marija)}}\n[[Category:1447 births]]\n[[Category:1490s deaths]]\n[[Category:Bosnian queens|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Medieval Serbian royal consorts|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Kotromani\u0107 dynasty|Maria of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Brankovi\u0107 dynasty|Maria]]\n[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy]]\n[[Category:Medieval Serbian people of Greek descent]]\n", "name_user": "Agricolae", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFamily tree:migrate template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_of_Serbia,_Queen_of_Bosnia"}

The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

Corporations such as [[Weirton Steel]] have had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe new Findlay Connector has been built in western [[Pennsylvania]] as a toll-access highway between [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] at [[Interstate 376]] and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Travel time between the Pittsburgh International Airport and the city of Steubenville is now approximately 25 minutes.\n\nSteubenville is located near two large [[shale]] formations - the [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus]] and Utica formations.\n\n==Culture==\n===Historic sites===\nFort Steuben, located downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the [[Seven Ranges]] of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAdjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Ohio Valley Steelworker\" Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the [[Ohio Valley]] [[Steelworkers]].  The life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd).  In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|title=Steelworker on the Move|first=Dave|last=Gossett|date=13 November 2014|newspaper=Herald-Star|access-date=2014-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220062105/http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|archive-date=2014-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere is a statue downtown commemorating [[Edwin Stanton]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[secretary of war]].

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.

Finkel returned to full-time ring announcing at [[Royal Rumble 1996]].\n\n===Storylines===\nAs an announcer, Finkel was generally separate from the scripted [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]], but occasionally he became part of the company's storylines. In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase eventually helped Hennig win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who regularly complained about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]]. On August 26, during the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown]],'' Jericho encouraged Finkel to attack SmackDown announcer [[Tony Chimel]] and take back his place as lead announcer. Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair. Several weeks later, Finkel adopted the role of '''El Dopo''', a masked referee who unfairly officiated a Shamrock match, awarding the win to [[Curtis Hughes]].<ref name=\"Obsessed with wrestling\">{{cite web|first=|last=|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/h/howard-finkel.php|title=Howard's Obsessed with wrestling profile and El Dopo|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Obsessedwithwrestling.com}}</ref> On the October 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jericho defeated Hughes with help from Finkel, but [[slavery|gave]] Finkel to Curtis Hughes after the match.<ref name=\"Resutls smackdown 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |title=Smackdown Results:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012210933/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref> Four days later on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Hughes bet and lost Finkel in a game of poker, to [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]].<ref name=\"Results RAW 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=Raw:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn an August 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Finkel turned heel and began a brief feud with ''Raw'' ring announcer [[Lilian Garcia]] over the lead spot, before both were attacked by [[3-Minute Warning]].<ref name=\"lillian 1\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020805.html|title=Howard Finkel wants his job back|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref> The following week, Garcia defeated Finkel in an evening gown/tuxedo match with help from [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Stacy Keibler]], who were insulted by a remark made by Finkel.<ref name=\"lillian 2\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020826.html|title=Howard Finkel vs Lillian|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132020===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2018}}\nBy 2000, Howard Finkel had taken a lighter schedule with the additions of [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Tony Chimel]] to Raw and SmackDown, respectively, but he still announced for some of the WWF/E's pay-per-view events.\n\nBy 2006, Finkel was rarely heard from even at pay-per-view wrestling events. However, he regularly announced at house shows and introduced the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees at WrestleMania. Finkel himself was inducted on April 4, 2009 by \"Mean\" [[Gene Okerlund]]. Because Finkel was one of that year's inductees, SmackDown announcer [[Justin Roberts]] replaced him in introducing the group at [[WrestleMania XXV]]. Finkel's television appearances were sporadic, at major pay-per-views and occasional episodes of Raw and SmackDown. Finkel appeared at every [[WrestleMania]] from 1985 to 2016.\n\n[[File:Howard Finkel 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Finkel in the [[Wrestling ring|ring]] in 2009]]\nFinkel did the voiceover in the intro for the WWE.com video show, ''[[John Morrison and The Miz|The Dirt Sheet]]'', and also conducted interviews for various WWE.com programs. He was WWE's chief [[statistician]]. On September 7, 2009, he announced in special guest host [[Bob Barker]]'s ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]''-inspired segments. He was in the background of the ''[[WWE SmackDown#Special episodes|Decade of SmackDown]]'' celebrations on the October 2 episode.\n\nFinkel returned to ring announcing (for one night only) on the November 15, 2010 [[WWE Raw#Special episodes|\"Old School\" episode]] of Raw. He appeared on an episode of [[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]], in an \"Outthink the Fink\" challenge. In a March 28, 2011 interview, Finkel stated his favorite (and career-defining) accomplishment was announcing at [[WrestleMania III]], in front of over 93,000 fans.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\"/>\n\nOn November 20, 2011, at [[Survivor Series (2011)|Survivor Series]] in Madison Square Garden, Finkel was the special ring announcer for [[CM Punk]], in his [[WWE Championship]] match against [[Alberto Del Rio]].\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Finkel appeared on the \"Blast from the Past\" episode of SmackDown.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, Finkel was a special ring announcer on the 1,000th episode of Raw.\n\nIn 2014, Finkel was a cast member on the [[WWE Network]] original reality show, [[WWE Legends' House|Legends' House]].

[[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees at WrestleMania passed to other ring announcers in the WWE beginning in 2017.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, at the 25th anniversary of Monday Night Raw, Finkel was the

Blassie.jpg|thumb|right|Finkel (center) built his reputation announcing matches at Madison Square Garden]]\nFinkel, a native of [[Newark, New Jersey]], was the WWE's first employee after having been first hired in 1975 by Vince McMahon Sr. for what was then known as the WWWF. Finkel debuted as a ring announcer at [[Madison Square Garden]] on January 17, 1977. By 1979, he had become the organization's lead ring announcer for their biggest events. Finkel became the first employee of the WWE on April 1, 1980 and had been the longest lasting employee until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.wwe.com/superstars/howardfinkel|accessdate=2019-01-27|title=Howard Finkel|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Throughout his career, Finkel's distinctive voice was sometimes used in the [[title sequence]] for the company's various television programs. Finkel's signature call was his announcement of a new champion following a title change, in which he would place extra emphasis on the word \"new\", in order to draw the greatest reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"WWE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/howardfinkel/|title=Howard Finkel's Hall of Fame Profile|accessdate=2011-03-29|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Finkel came up with the event name \"[[WrestleMania]]\", as well as [[Ricky Steamboat]]'s \"Dragon\" nickname. In 1984, Finkel became WWF's lead ring announcer for television tapings, replacing the retired Joe McHugh. During a 2011 interview, Finkel said he had also played a part in the talent relations and creative departments during the early days of the WWF.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\">{{cite web |url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729100940/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1987, Finkel was presented a plaque by [[Gene Okerlund]], commemorating ten years of announcing at Madison Square Garden.<ref name=\"award\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|title=Howard Finkel presented with plaque |accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=[[WWE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328105719/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|archivedate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> In 1993, at the \"Roman\"-themed [[WrestleMania IX]], Finkel was introduced in a [[toga]] as '''Finkus Maximus'''.\n\nIn 1995, Finkel took a seven-month hiatus from ring announcing on pay-per-views and television broadcasts (but not at house shows) and was replaced by Manny Garcia. Finkel returned to full-time ring announcing at [[Royal Rumble 1996]].\n\n===Storylines===\nAs an announcer, Finkel was generally separate from the scripted [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]], but occasionally he became part of the company's storylines. In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase eventually helped Hennig win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who regularly complained about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]]. On August 26, during the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown]],'' Jericho encouraged Finkel to attack SmackDown announcer [[Tony Chimel]] and take back his place as lead announcer. Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair.
