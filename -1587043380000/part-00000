He began his career in [[Non-League football|non-league football]] and did not turn professional until he joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at the age of 26. In 1996, Hessenthaler joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and spent the next ten years at the club as player and later player-manager, managing the club to its highest ever finish in the [[English football league system]] and becoming regarded as a legend of the Kent club. After leaving Gillingham, he had a short spell at [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], before joining [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in 2007. In his two seasons in charge he led the club to successive championships, of [[Isthmian League Division One South]] and the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]]. After three years at Dover, he became manager at Gillingham for the second time, but his contract was terminated at the end of the [[2011\u201312 in English football|2011\u201312]] season.  He returned to the club as assistant manager in 2014, before taking on a similar role at [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] the following year. In 2016, he was appointed manager of the club, but was sacked later the same year.  In November he was appointed manager of [[Eastleigh F.C.|Eastleigh]], but the following year left to return to Dover.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Non-league career===\nHessenthaler was born in [[Dartford]], Kent.

It was named '''Carmarthen Boroughs''' from 1832 to 1918.\nAt its abolition in 1997 it was replaced, partly by the new [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]] constituency and partly by [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]].\n\n== History ==\nBecause the seat contained mining areas in the valley of the [[River Gwendraeth]] (until the 1980s), much countryside and a high proportion of [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] speakers, it was fertile territory for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] alike. Although the Conservatives never won the seat, they came within 1200 votes of doing so in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].\n\nCarmarthen is notable as the first constituency to elect a Plaid Cymru MP, [[Gwynfor Evans]], at a [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|1966 by-election]]. Evans was later involved in one of the closest General Election results ever in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], when he lost to the Labour candidate by only three votes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/128.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} VOTE 2001 {{!}} RESULTS & CONSTITUENCIES {{!}} Carmarthen East & Dinefwr | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>The BBC article quoted above says that it was the second closest General Election result since the Second World War. But the [[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1990s|Winchester general election result of 1997]] was closer.</ref> The constituency also shot to fame in the following election in October 1974 as the only seat in the country to see its turnout rise on that of February 1974.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nUntil 1832, it was a [[borough constituency]] consisting of the town of [[Carmarthen]]. \nBetween 1832 and 1918 it was a district of boroughs constituency, consisting of Carmarthen itself and [[Llanelli]], and was sometimes called \"The Carmarthen Boroughs\".\n\nIn 1918, the borough was abolished, but the name was transferred to one of the divisions of the county of [[Carmarthenshire]].\nThe constituency was made up of the whole of the county of [[Carmarthenshire]] except for the urban area around [[Llanelli]]. Notable towns were [[Carmarthen]] itself, [[Ammanford]] and [[Llandeilo]].\n\nIn 1997, the [[Boundary Commission for Wales]] recommended an extra seat for [[Dyfed]].<ref>C. Rallings & M. Thrasher, The Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies, p.12 (Plymouth: LGC Elections Centre, 1995)</ref> This led to the seat being split two to one between [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen East & Dinefwr]] and [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West & South Pembrokeshire]].<ref>C.

It was named '''Carmarthen Boroughs''' from 1832 to 1918.\nAt its abolition in 1997 it was replaced, partly by the new [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]] constituency and partly by [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]].\n\n== History ==\nBecause the seat contained mining areas in the valley of the [[River Gwendraeth]] (until the 1980s), much countryside and a high proportion of [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] speakers, it was fertile territory for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] alike. Although the Conservatives never won the seat, they came within 1200 votes of doing so in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].\n\nCarmarthen is notable as the first constituency to elect a Plaid Cymru MP, [[Gwynfor Evans]], at a [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|1966 by-election]]. Evans was later involved in one of the closest General Election results ever in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], when he lost to the Labour candidate by only three votes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/128.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} VOTE 2001 {{!}} RESULTS & CONSTITUENCIES {{!}} Carmarthen East & Dinefwr | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>The BBC article quoted above says that it was the second closest General Election result since the Second World War.

Notable towns were [[Carmarthen]] itself, [[Ammanford]] and [[Llandeilo]].\n\nIn 1997, the [[Boundary Commission for Wales]] recommended an extra seat for [[Dyfed]].<ref>C. Rallings & M.

Later remade in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Osthe]]'' and in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Gabbar Singh (film)|Gabbar Singh]]'', the film was followed by two sequels: ''[[Dabangg 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[Dabangg 3]]'' (2019). The latter serves as a partial prequel, describing a flashback which formed the events of ''Dabangg'' itself.\n\n== Plot ==\nChulbul Pandey, a young boy, lives with his younger half-brother, Makkhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey, stepfather Prajapati Pandey and mother, Naina Devi in Laalgunj, Uttar Pradesh. He has a troubled relationship with Prajapati and Makkhi. After 21 years, Chulbul becomes a policeman. Chulbul, who calls himself \"[[Robin Hood]]\" Pandey, still lives with his family. Makkhi is in love with Nirmala, whose father Masterji opposes the relationship. Chulbul falls in love with a girl named Rajjo, whom he meets during a police chase culminating in an encounter.\n\nA corrupt political leader named Chedi Singh meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks Prajapati to arrange his marriage with Nirmala. Prajapati refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals some cash from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Masterji, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has to take care of her father, Hariya\u2014a drunkard.\n\nChulbul comes home to find his mother, Naini Devi, dead. He goes to Prajapati to make peace, as he is the only family left. However, Prajapati refuses and despises him as an outcast. Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala. Chulbul convinces Hariya to marry Rajjo. Hariya commits suicide, as he knows that Rajjo will not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony. Masterji feels disgraced and cancels Makkhi's wedding with Nirmala.\n\nMakkhi beats up one of the workers in his factory due to a small mishap. The worker goes to the police station with his mother to file a complaint. Chulbul beats up Makkhi in public to disgrace him. Chedi takes advantage of the situation and takes Makkhi along with Prajapati to the police station. Prajapati resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Sahu a.k.a. Dayal Babu, a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates Chedi's breweries and wrongly frames him for it.\n\nTo take revenge, Chedi burns Makkhi's factory. Prajapati, shocked, suffers a heart attack and is hospitalised. Makkhi goes to Chedi for help, little knowing that he was the one responsible. Chedi agrees to finance Prajapati's treatment if he delivers a crate of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unbeknownst to Makkhi, Chedi has placed a bomb inside the crate, which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, but ends up confessing it to Chulbul. He reveals to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with him. During a final confrontation between Chulbul and Chedi, Makkhi reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed Naini. Enraged, Chulbul [[Asphyxia|suffocates]] Chedi to death. Later, Chulbul gets Makkhi married to Nirmala in the presence of her father, while Rajjo reveals that she is pregnant.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]].<ref name=\"BHC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/515346/Dabangg |title=Dabangg: Cast and Crew details |website=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112053036/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/515346/Dabangg |archive-date=12 January 2012 |access-date=25 June 2010}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Chulbul Pandey\n* [[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Rajjo\n* [[Arbaaz Khan]] as Makkhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Prajapati Pandey\n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Naini Devi\n* [[Sonu Sood]] as Chedi Singh\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Haria\n* [[Om Puri]] as Kasturilal Vishkarma\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dayal Babu\n* [[Mahi Gill]] as Nirmala\n* [[Tinu Anand]] as Masterji, Nirmala's father\n* [[Murli Sharma]] as ACP Malik\n* Ram Sujan Singh as Chaubeji\n* Rajeev Sharma as Toluram Rastogi\n* [[Amitosh Nagpal]] as Sumant Kumar\n* [[Malaika Arora]] as Munni in the [[item number]] \"[[Munni Badnaam Hui]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\nSalman Khan grew a moustache after consulting with his brother and prepared his hair to suit his role.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ive-a-special-connect-with-police-salman-khan/1/109520.html |title=I've a special connect with police: Salman Khan |date=19 August 2010 |work=[[India Today]] |access-date=19 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109001012/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ive-a-special-connect-with-police-salman-khan/1/109520.html |archive-date=9 January 2014}}</ref> For the former, he had to try out nearly fifty styles in a span of four months before commencement of the filming.

Later remade in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Osthe]]'' and in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Gabbar Singh (film)|Gabbar Singh]]'', the film was followed by two sequels: ''[[Dabangg 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[Dabangg 3]]'' (2019). The latter serves as a partial prequel, describing a flashback which formed the events of ''Dabangg'' itself.\n\n== Plot ==\nChulbul Pandey, a young boy, lives with his younger half-brother, Makkhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey, stepfather Prajapati Pandey and mother, Naina Devi in Laalgunj, Uttar Pradesh. He has a troubled relationship with Prajapati and Makkhi. After 21 years, Chulbul becomes a policeman. Chulbul, who calls himself \"[[Robin Hood]]\" Pandey, still lives with his family. Makkhi is in love with Nirmala, whose father Masterji opposes the relationship. Chulbul falls in love with a girl named Rajjo, whom he meets during a police chase culminating in an encounter.\n\nA corrupt political leader named Chedi Singh meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks Prajapati to arrange his marriage with Nirmala. Prajapati refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals some cash from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Masterji, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has to take care of her father, Hariya\u2014a drunkard.\n\nChulbul comes home to find his mother, Naini Devi, dead. He goes to Prajapati to make peace, as he is the only family left. However, Prajapati refuses and despises him as an outcast. Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala. Chulbul convinces Hariya to marry Rajjo. Hariya commits suicide, as he knows that Rajjo will not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony. Masterji feels disgraced and cancels Makkhi's wedding with Nirmala.\n\nMakkhi beats up one of the workers in his factory due to a small mishap. The worker goes to the police station with his mother to file a complaint. Chulbul beats up Makkhi in public to disgrace him. Chedi takes advantage of the situation and takes Makkhi along with Prajapati to the police station. Prajapati resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Sahu a.k.a. Dayal Babu, a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates Chedi's breweries and wrongly frames him for it.\n\nTo take revenge, Chedi burns Makkhi's factory. Prajapati, shocked, suffers a heart attack and is hospitalised. Makkhi goes to Chedi for help, little knowing that he was the one responsible. Chedi agrees to finance Prajapati's treatment if he delivers a crate of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unbeknownst to Makkhi, Chedi has placed a bomb inside the crate, which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, but ends up confessing it to Chulbul. He reveals to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with him. During a final confrontation between Chulbul and Chedi, Makkhi reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed Naini. Enraged, Chulbul [[Asphyxia|suffocates]] Chedi to death. Later, Chulbul gets Makkhi married to Nirmala in the presence of her father, while Rajjo reveals that she is pregnant.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]].<ref name=\"BHC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/515346/Dabangg |title=Dabangg: Cast and Crew details |website=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112053036/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/515346/Dabangg |archive-date=12 January 2012 |access-date=25 June 2010}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Chulbul Pandey\n* [[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Rajjo\n* [[Arbaaz Khan]] as Makkhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Prajapati Pandey\n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Naini Devi\n* [[Sonu Sood]] as Chedi Singh\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Haria\n* [[Om Puri]] as Kasturilal Vishkarma\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dayal Babu\n* [[Mahi Gill]] as Nirmala\n* [[Tinu Anand]] as Masterji, Nirmala's father\n* [[Murli Sharma]] as ACP Malik\n* Ram Sujan Singh as Chaubeji\n* Rajeev Sharma as Toluram Rastogi\n* [[Amitosh Nagpal]] as Sumant Kumar\n* [[Malaika Arora]] as Munni in the [[item number]] \"[[Munni Badnaam Hui]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\nSalman Khan grew a moustache after consulting with his brother and prepared his hair to suit his role.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ive-a-special-connect-with-police-salman-khan/1/109520.html |title=I've a special connect with police: Salman Khan |date=19 August 2010 |work=[[India Today]] |access-date=19 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109001012/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ive-a-special-connect-with-police-salman-khan/1/109520.html |archive-date=9 January 2014}}</ref> For the former, he had to try out nearly fifty styles in a span of four months before commencement of the filming.
