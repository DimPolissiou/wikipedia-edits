Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] and structure, folding wings and [[stabilator]]s, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] as a replacement in 2009.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and origins ===\nDuring the 1970s, the [[Yakovlev Yak-38]], then the [[Soviet Navy]]'s only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|Project 1143]] carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the [[MiG-23]]s and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-24]]s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the [[Project 1153 OREL|Project 1153]] carrier, which would have accommodated the [[Su-25]]s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and Su-27K operations.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;126.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\">{{cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Historical background|publisher=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|access-date=2 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513212625/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n<!--http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/07/22/Outside_View_Russias_carrier_weakness/UPI-46861216749820/-->\n\nTo prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the [[steam catapult]], [[arresting gear]], optical and radio landing systems.

A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\">Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;462.</ref> Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (\u22123, \u221224 and \u221225), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a [[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump]] profile.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/>\n\nConceptual designs of the Su-27K commenced in 1978.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\"/> On 18 April 1984, the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter.<ref name=\"Williams p. 127\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;127.</ref> Full-scale design of the Su-27K soon started as the \"T-10K\" under the guidance of Konstantin Marbyshev. Nikolai Sadovnikov was appointed the [[OKB|design bureau]]'s Chief Test Pilot for the programme. By November 1984, conceptual design had passed its critical design review, with the detailed design finalised in 1986.

The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck.

However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-27PS]] [[search-and-rescue]] helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.<ref name=\"gordon\">Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>\n\nDuring the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/> Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/> During 1990\u20131991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/>\n\n=== Further developments ===\nThe first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] as a replacement in 2009.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and origins ===\nDuring the 1970s, the [[Yakovlev Yak-38]], then the [[Soviet Navy]]'s only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|Project 1143]] carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the [[MiG-23]]s and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-24]]s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the [[Project 1153 OREL|Project 1153]] carrier, which would have accommodated the [[Su-25]]s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and Su-27K operations.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;126.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\">{{cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Historical background|publisher=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|access-date=2 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513212625/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n<!--http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/07/22/Outside_View_Russias_carrier_weakness/UPI-46861216749820/-->\n\nTo prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the [[steam catapult]], [[arresting gear]], optical and radio landing systems.

A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\">Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;462.</ref> Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (\u22123, \u221224 and \u221225), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982.

The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another two years before ''Tbilisi'', subsequently renamed ''Admiral Kuznetsov'', left the shipyard.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;129.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\"/>\n\nViktor Pugachyov, piloting the second Su-27K, became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/><ref>Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> It was found that the carrier's [[jet blast deflector]]s were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60\u00b0; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45\u00b0. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-27PS]] [[search-and-rescue]] helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.<ref name=\"gordon\">Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>\n\nDuring the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/> Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/> During 1990\u20131991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/>\n\n=== Further developments ===\nThe first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter.

The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd [[Radio Battalion]], Kaneohe HI.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter. [[Staff Sergeant]] Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of [[Australian Defence Force|Australian forces]] intervening in [[civil war]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|overthrow]] the newly installed government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] in the Republic of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Radio Battalion]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Alfred M.
