Superinsulation is one of the ancestors of the [[passive house]] approach.\n\n==Definition==\nThere is no universally agreed definition of superinsulation, but superinsulated buildings typically include:\n* Very high levels of [[Building insulation|insulation]], typically [[R-value (insulation)|R-40 (RSI-7)]] walls and [[R-value (insulation)|R-60 (RSI-10.6)]] roof, corresponding to [[International System of Units|SI]] [[U-value]]s of 0.15 and 0.1 W/(m\u00b2\u00b7K) respectively)\n* Details to ensure insulation continuity where walls meet roofs, foundations, and other walls\n* Airtight construction, especially around doors and windows to prevent air infiltration pushing heat in or out\n* a [[heat recovery ventilation]] system to provide fresh air\n* No large windows facing any particular direction<!-- (unlike [[passive solar]], which uses large windows facing the sun{{Fact|date=February 2009}} and fewer/smaller windows facing other directions).\n* No large amounts of [[thermal mass]]{{Fact|date=February 2009}}\n* No active or passive solar heat {{Fact|date=February 2009}}(but may have [[solar water heating]] and/or [[hot water heat recycling]]) -->\n* Much smaller than conventional heating system, sometimes just a small backup heater\n\nNisson & Dutt (1985) suggest that a house might be described as \"superinsulated\" if the cost of space heating is lower than the cost of water heating.<ref>Nisson, J.

Ned; and Gautam Dutt, ''The Superinsulated Home Book'', John Wiley & Sons, 1985 {{ISBN|0-471-88734-X}}, {{ISBN|0-471-81343-5}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\nA superinsulated house is intended to reduce heating needs very significantly and may even be heated predominantly by intrinsic heat sources (waste heat generated by appliances and the [[body heat]] of the occupants) with very small amounts of backup heat. This has been demonstrated to work even in very cold climates but requires close attention to construction details in addition to the insulation (see [[IEA Solar Heating & Cooling Implementing Agreement Task 13]]).\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"superinsulation\" was coined by Wayne Schick at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. In 1976 he was part of a team that developed a design called the \"Lo-Cal\" house, using computer simulations based on the climate of [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Several houses, duplexes and condos based on Lo-Cal principles were built in [[Champaign\u2013Urbana]], [[Illinois]] in the 1970s.<ref>McCulley, M. (2008, November).

It was the first house to publicly demonstrate the value of superinsulation and generated a lot of attention. It originally included some experimental evacuated-tube solar panels, but they were not needed and were later removed. The house was heated primarily by waste heat from appliances and the occupants.<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" /><ref name=Holladay>{{Cite web |last=Holladay |first=Martin |title=Forgotten Pioneers of Energy Efficiency |publisher=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com |date=April 17, 2009 |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/forgotten-pioneers-energy-efficiency}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977 the \"Leger House\" was built by Eugene Leger, in [[East Pepperell, Massachusetts]]. It had a more conventional appearance than the \"Saskatchewan House\", and also received extensive publicity.<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" />\n\nPublicity from the \"Saskatchewan House\" and the \"Leger House\" influenced other builders, and many superinsulated houses were built over the next few years. These houses also influenced [[Wolfgang Feist]] when he developed the [[passive house|Passivhaus standard]].<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" />\n\nThe Kropper house was the first super-insulated retrofit in the US.  In 1979, Steve Kropper and the Rowell Energy group undertook the retrofit of a 1911 triple-decker, a three family home design nearly identical to the estimated 18,000 triple-deckers in the City of Boston.  The walls were insulated to R-38 primarily due to 4\" of cellulose blown into the original wall cavity, a 1/2\" air gap then a rigid 2\" foil-faced poly-isocyanurate board.  The ceiling was insulated to R-53 with a combination of cellulose blown into the ceiling rafters then layers of fiberglass batts.  The windows were unexceptional at R-2, excepting the low infiltration and use of casement units with better seals than the existing double-hung windows.  Each unit was heated from a 30 gallon gas fired water heater with a low volume circulating pump in one zone for each floor.  Peak load once super-insulated was estimated at 32,500 BTU/hour (dt= 65), compared with 170,600 BTU/hour for the original source, individual forced hot air furnaces burning #2 fuel oil.  Due to the challenge of reducing infiltration in a retrofit, no intentional source of outside air was required. The project was documented in the [https://www.csmonitor.com/1981/1028/102853.html Christian Science Monitor (October 28, 1981)], Boston Herald (September 23, 1980) Better Homes and Gardens, [http://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/437273294 the Boston Globe (Nov 19, 1982)], NE Solar Energy Association and many other publications.\n\n==Retrofits==\nIt is possible, and increasingly desirable, to retrofit superinsulation to an existing houses or buildings. The easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation,<ref>Ueno, K., \"Residential Exterior Wall Superinsulation Retrofit Details and Analysis\", ASHRAE Buildings 11 Conference, 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128014936/http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |archive-date=2011-01-28 |df= }}</ref> and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation. A [[vapor barrier]] can be installed on the outside of the original framing but may not be needed. An improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding, as older homes tend to be leaky, and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability. Care should be exercised when adding a vapor barrier as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture, or even cause summer (in climates with humid summers) [[interstitial condensation]] and consequent [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[mildew]]. This may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure. Many builders in northern Canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach, placing the vapor barrier no further out than 1/3 of the R-value of the insulated portion of the wall. This method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance (e.g., they use fibrous insulation) and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation. This approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the vapor barrier during cold weather. The 1/3:2/3 rule will ensure that the vapor barrier temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air, and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems. For example, with an internal room temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F), the vapor barrier will then only reach 7.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (45&nbsp;\u00b0F) when the outside temperatures is at \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0F). Indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) when it is that cold outdoors, much lower than the predicted vapor barrier temperature, and hence the 1/3:2/3 rules is quite conservative. For climates that do not often experience \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C, the 1/3:2/3 rule should be amended to 40:60% or 50:50. As the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules, buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather (e.g., museums, swimming pools, humidified or poorly ventilated airtight homes) may require different rules, as can buildings with drier interior environments (such as highly ventilated buildings, warehouses). The 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes, which can be applied when [[retrofitting]] older homes.\n\nA vapor permeable building wrap on the outside of the original wall helps keep the wind out, yet allows the wall assembly to dry to the exterior. [[Asphalt felt]] and other products such as permeable polymer based products are available for this purpose, and usually double as the Water Resistant Barrier / drainage plane as well.\n\nInterior retrofits are possible where the owner wants to preserve the old exterior siding, or where [[building setback|setback]] requirements don't leave space for an exterior retrofit. Sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised (because of the many partition, floor, and service penetrations), the original wall assembly is rendered colder in cold weather (and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry), occupants are exposed to major disruptions, and the house is left with less interior space. Another approach is to use the 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above\u2014that is, to install a vapor retarder on the inside of the existing wall (if there isn't one there already) and add insulation and support structure to the inside. This way, utilities (power, telephone, cable, and plumbing) can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier. Polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates, because they limit the wall's ability to dry to the interior. This approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount (e.g., only R6 can be added to a 2\u00d74 R12 wall).\n\n==Costs and benefits==\nIn new construction, the cost of the extra insulation and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system.  In homes with numerous rooms, more than one floor, air conditioning or large sized, a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures.  Small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case.  When peak demand and annual energy use is low, sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required.  Hence, even electric resistance heaters may be used.  Electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low.  Other forms of backup heater are widely used, such as wood pellets, wood stoves, natural gas boilers or even furnaces. The cost of a superinsulation retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel (which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems, natural disasters or geopolitical events), the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building, or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort.\n\nDuring a power failure, a superinsulated house stays warm longer as heat loss is much less than normal, but the thermal storage capacity of the structural materials and contents is the same. Adverse weather may hamper efforts to restore power, leading to outages lasting a week or more. When deprived of their continuous supply of electricity (either for heat directly, or to operate gas-fired [[furnaces]]), conventional houses cool rapidly during, and may be at greater risk of costly damage due to freezing [[water pipes]].

Superinsulation is one of the ancestors of the [[passive house]] approach.\n\n==Definition==\nThere is no universally agreed definition of superinsulation, but superinsulated buildings typically include:\n* Very high levels of [[Building insulation|insulation]], typically [[R-value (insulation)|R-40 (RSI-7)]] walls and [[R-value (insulation)|R-60 (RSI-10.6)]] roof, corresponding to [[International System of Units|SI]] [[U-value]]s of 0.15 and 0.1 W/(m\u00b2\u00b7K) respectively)\n* Details to ensure insulation continuity where walls meet roofs, foundations, and other walls\n* Airtight construction, especially around doors and windows to prevent air infiltration pushing heat in or out\n* a [[heat recovery ventilation]] system to provide fresh air\n* No large windows facing any particular direction<!-- (unlike [[passive solar]], which uses large windows facing the sun{{Fact|date=February 2009}} and fewer/smaller windows facing other directions).\n* No large amounts of [[thermal mass]]{{Fact|date=February 2009}}\n* No active or passive solar heat {{Fact|date=February 2009}}(but may have [[solar water heating]] and/or [[hot water heat recycling]]) -->\n* Much smaller than conventional heating system, sometimes just a small backup heater\n\nNisson & Dutt (1985) suggest that a house might be described as \"superinsulated\" if the cost of space heating is lower than the cost of water heating.<ref>Nisson, J. D. Ned; and Gautam Dutt, ''The Superinsulated Home Book'', John Wiley & Sons, 1985 {{ISBN|0-471-88734-X}}, {{ISBN|0-471-81343-5}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\nA superinsulated house is intended to reduce heating needs very significantly and may even be heated predominantly by intrinsic heat sources (waste heat generated by appliances and the [[body heat]] of the occupants) with very small amounts of backup heat. This has been demonstrated to work even in very cold climates but requires close attention to construction details in addition to the insulation (see [[IEA Solar Heating & Cooling Implementing Agreement Task 13]]).\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"superinsulation\" was coined by Wayne Schick at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. In 1976 he was part of a team that developed a design called the \"Lo-Cal\" house, using computer simulations based on the climate of [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Several houses, duplexes and condos based on Lo-Cal principles were built in [[Champaign\u2013Urbana]], [[Illinois]] in the 1970s.<ref>McCulley, M. (2008, November).

It was the first house to publicly demonstrate the value of superinsulation and generated a lot of attention. It originally included some experimental evacuated-tube solar panels, but they were not needed and were later removed. The house was heated primarily by waste heat from appliances and the occupants.<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" /><ref name=Holladay>{{Cite web |last=Holladay |first=Martin |title=Forgotten Pioneers of Energy Efficiency |publisher=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com |date=April 17, 2009 |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/forgotten-pioneers-energy-efficiency}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977 the \"Leger House\" was built by Eugene Leger, in [[East Pepperell, Massachusetts]]. It had a more conventional appearance than the \"Saskatchewan House\", and also received extensive publicity.<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" />\n\nPublicity from the \"Saskatchewan House\" and the \"Leger House\" influenced other builders, and many superinsulated houses were built over the next few years. These houses also influenced [[Wolfgang Feist]] when he developed the [[passive house|Passivhaus standard]].<ref name=\"Denzerbook\" />\n\nThe Kropper house was the first super-insulated retrofit in the US.  In 1979, Steve Kropper and the Rowell Energy group undertook the retrofit of a 1911 triple-decker, a three family home design nearly identical to the estimated 18,000 triple-deckers in the City of Boston.  The walls were insulated to R-38 primarily due to 4\" of cellulose blown into the original wall cavity, a 1/2\" air gap then a rigid 2\" foil-faced poly-isocyanurate board.  The ceiling was insulated to R-53 with a combination of cellulose blown into the ceiling rafters then layers of fiberglass batts.  The windows were unexceptional at R-2, excepting the low infiltration and use of casement units with better seals than the existing double-hung windows.  Each unit was heated from a 30 gallon gas fired water heater with a low volume circulating pump in one zone for each floor.  Peak load once super-insulated was estimated at 32,500 BTU/hour (dt= 65), compared with 170,600 BTU/hour for the original source, individual forced hot air furnaces burning #2 fuel oil.  Due to the challenge of reducing infiltration in a retrofit, no intentional source of outside air was required. The project was documented in the [https://www.csmonitor.com/1981/1028/102853.html Christian Science Monitor (October 28, 1981)], Boston Herald (September 23, 1980) Better Homes and Gardens, [http://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/437273294 the Boston Globe (Nov 19, 1982)], NE Solar Energy Association and many other publications.\n\n==Retrofits==\nIt is possible, and increasingly desirable, to retrofit superinsulation to an existing houses or buildings. The easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation,<ref>Ueno, K., \"Residential Exterior Wall Superinsulation Retrofit Details and Analysis\", ASHRAE Buildings 11 Conference, 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128014936/http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |archive-date=2011-01-28 |df= }}</ref> and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation. A [[vapor barrier]] can be installed on the outside of the original framing but may not be needed. An improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding, as older homes tend to be leaky, and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability. Care should be exercised when adding a vapor barrier as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture, or even cause summer (in climates with humid summers) [[interstitial condensation]] and consequent [[mold]] and [[mildew]]. This may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure. Many builders in northern Canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach, placing the vapor barrier no further out than 1/3 of the R-value of the insulated portion of the wall. This method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance (e.g., they use fibrous insulation) and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation. This approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the vapor barrier during cold weather. The 1/3:2/3 rule will ensure that the vapor barrier temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air, and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems. For example, with an internal room temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F), the vapor barrier will then only reach 7.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (45&nbsp;\u00b0F) when the outside temperatures is at \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0F). Indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) when it is that cold outdoors, much lower than the predicted vapor barrier temperature, and hence the 1/3:2/3 rules is quite conservative. For climates that do not often experience \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C, the 1/3:2/3 rule should be amended to 40:60% or 50:50. As the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules, buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather (e.g., museums, swimming pools, humidified or poorly ventilated airtight homes) may require different rules, as can buildings with drier interior environments (such as highly ventilated buildings, warehouses). The 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes, which can be applied when [[retrofitting]] older homes.\n\nA vapor permeable building wrap on the outside of the original wall helps keep the wind out, yet allows the wall assembly to dry to the exterior. [[Asphalt felt]] and other products such as permeable polymer based products are available for this purpose, and usually double as the Water Resistant Barrier / drainage plane as well.\n\nInterior retrofits are possible where the owner wants to preserve the old exterior siding, or where [[building setback|setback]] requirements don't leave space for an exterior retrofit. Sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised (because of the many partition, floor, and service penetrations), the original wall assembly is rendered colder in cold weather (and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry), occupants are exposed to major disruptions, and the house is left with less interior space. Another approach is to use the 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above\u2014that is, to install a vapor retarder on the inside of the existing wall (if there isn't one there already) and add insulation and support structure to the inside. This way, utilities (power, telephone, cable, and plumbing) can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier. Polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates, because they limit the wall's ability to dry to the interior. This approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount (e.g., only R6 can be added to a 2\u00d74 R12 wall).\n\n==Costs and benefits==\nIn new construction, the cost of the extra insulation and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system.  In homes with numerous rooms, more than one floor, air conditioning or large sized, a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures.  Small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case.  When peak demand and annual energy use is low, sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required.  Hence, even electric resistance heaters may be used.  Electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low.  Other forms of backup heater are widely used, such as wood pellets, wood stoves, natural gas boilers or even furnaces. The cost of a superinsulation retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel (which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems, natural disasters or geopolitical events), the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building, or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort.\n\nDuring a power failure, a superinsulated house stays warm longer as heat loss is much less than normal, but the thermal storage capacity of the structural materials and contents is the same. Adverse weather may hamper efforts to restore power, leading to outages lasting a week or more. When deprived of their continuous supply of electricity (either for heat directly, or to operate gas-fired [[furnaces]]), conventional houses cool rapidly during, and may be at greater risk of costly damage due to freezing [[water pipes]]. Residents who use supplemental heating methods without proper care during such episodes, or at any other time, may subject themselves to risk of [[Fire#Uncontrolled fire|fire]] or [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|energy}}\nThe first superinsulated houses used standard stud-wall construction, but other building techniques can be used:\n*[[Insulating concrete form]] (ICF)\n*[[Straw-bale construction]]\n*[[Structural insulated panel]] (SIP)\n*[[Earth sheltering|Earth-sheltered]]\n*[[Earthship]]\n*[[Energy conservation]]\n*[[Passive house]]\n*[[Building insulation]]\n*[[Building insulation materials]]\n*[[Zero-energy building]]\n*[[Seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Computation and description of an outside insulation house: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070626232339/http://jehhan.ifrance.com/index.html To build for tomorrow] (translated from French)\n*Booth, Don, ''Sun/Earth Buffering and Superinsulation'', 1983, {{ISBN|0-9604422-4-3}}\n*Marshall, Brian; and Robert Argue, ''The Super-Insulated Retrofit Book'', Renewable Energy in Canada, 1981 {{ISBN|0-920456-45-6}}, {{ISBN|0-920456-43-X}}\n*[[William Shurcliff|Shurcliff, William A.]], ''Superinsulated houses: A survey of principles and practice'', Brick House Pub.

The souls in the underworld did not age or really change in any sense. They did not lead any sort of active life in the underworld &ndash; they were exactly the same as they were in life.<ref name=alb>Albinus pg.27</ref> Therefore, those who had died in battle were eternally blood-spattered in the underworld and those who had died peacefully were able to remain that way.<ref>Garland pg.74</ref>\n\nOverall, the Greek dead were considered to be irritable and unpleasant, but not dangerous or malevolent. They grew angry if they felt a hostile presence near their graves and [[Libation|drink offerings]] were given in order to appease them so as not to anger the dead.<ref>Garland pgs.5-6</ref> Mostly, blood offerings were given, due to the fact that they needed the essence of life to become communicative and conscious again.<ref name=long /> This is shown in Homer's [[Odyssey]], where [[Odysseus]] had to give blood in order for the souls to interact with him.

The Greeks also showed belief in the possibility of marriage in the underworld, which in a sense describes the Greek underworld having no difference than from their current life.<ref>Garland pg.71</ref>\n\n[[Lucian]] described the people of the underworld as simple skeletons.

If not, they were said to fly at the shores for one hundred years, until they were allowed to cross the river.<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6, 324\u2013330.</ref> To the Etruscans, Charon was considered a fearsome being \u2013 he wielded a hammer and was hook-nosed, bearded, and had animalistic ears with teeth.<ref name=bux /> In other early Greek depictions, Charon was considered merely an ugly bearded man with a conical hat and tunic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Theoi Project: Kharon|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Kharon.html|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> Later on, in more modern Greek folklore, he was considered more angelic, like the [[Archangel Michael]]. Nevertheless, Charon was considered a terrifying being since his duty was to bring these souls to the underworld and no one would persuade him to do otherwise.\n\n===Cerberus===\n[[File:Hades with cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hades with Cerberus.]]\n[[Cerberus]] (Kerberos), or the \"Hell-Hound\", is Hades' massive [[polycephaly|multi-headed]] (usually three-headed)<ref name=\"m-w\">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cerberus|title= Cerberus|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Cerberus|title=Yahoo!

They also lack ''phrenes'', or wit, and are heedless of what goes on around them and on the earth above them.<ref>Garland pg.1</ref> Their lives in the underworld were very neutral, so all social statuses and political positions were eliminated and no one was able to use their previous lives to their advantage in the underworld.<ref name=long />\n\nThe idea of progress did not exist in the Greek underworld &ndash; at the moment of death, the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] was frozen, in experience and appearance. The souls in the underworld did not age or really change in any sense. They did not lead any sort of active life in the underworld &ndash; they were exactly the same as they were in life.<ref name=alb>Albinus pg.27</ref> Therefore, those who had died in battle were eternally blood-spattered in the underworld and those who had died peacefully were able to remain that way.<ref>Garland pg.74</ref>\n\nOverall, the Greek dead were considered to be irritable and unpleasant, but not dangerous or malevolent. They grew angry if they felt a hostile presence near their graves and [[Libation|drink offerings]] were given in order to appease them so as not to anger the dead.<ref>Garland pgs.5-6</ref> Mostly, blood offerings were given, due to the fact that they needed the essence of life to become communicative and conscious again.<ref name=long /> This is shown in Homer's [[Odyssey]], where [[Odysseus]] had to give blood in order for the souls to interact with him. While in the underworld, the dead passed the time through simple pastimes such as playing games, as shown from objects found in tombs such as dice and game-boards.<ref name=gar>Garland pg.70</ref> Grave gifts such as clothing, jewelry, and food were left by the living for use in the underworld as well, since many viewed these gifts to carry over into the underworld.<ref name=alb /> There was not a general consensus as to whether the dead were able to consume food or not. Homer depicted the dead as unable to eat or drink unless they had been summoned; however, some reliefs portray the underworld as having many elaborate feasts.<ref name=gar /> While not completely clear, it is implied that the dead could still have sexual intimacy with another, although no children were produced. The Greeks also showed belief in the possibility of marriage in the underworld, which in a sense describes the Greek underworld having no difference than from their current life.<ref>Garland pg.71</ref>\n\n[[Lucian]] described the people of the underworld as simple skeletons. They are indistinguishable from each other, and it is impossible to tell who was wealthy or important in the living world.<ref>O\u2019Cleirigh pg.191</ref> However, this view of the underworld was not universal &ndash; Homer depicts the dead keeping their familiar faces.\n\nHades itself was free from the concept of time. The dead are aware of both the past and the future, and in poems describing Greek heroes, the dead helped move the plot of the story by prophesying and telling truths unknown to the hero.<ref name=alb /> The only way for humans to communicate with the dead was to suspend time and their normal life to reach Hades, the place beyond immediate perception and human time.<ref name=alb />\n\n==Greek attitudes==\nThe Greeks had a definite belief that there was a journey to the afterlife or another world. They believed that death was not a complete end to life or human existence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mystakidou|first=Kyriaki|author2=Eleni Tsilika|author3=Efi Parpa|author4=Emmanuel Katsouda|author5=Lambros Vlahos|title=Death and Grief in the Greek Culture|journal=OMEGA: Journal of Death and Dying|date=1 December 2004|volume=50|issue=1|page=24|url=http://baywood.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,2,5;journal,64,260;linkingpublicationresults,1:300329,1|accessdate=4 December 2012|doi=10.2190/YYAU-R4MN-AKKM-T496}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Greeks accepted the existence of the soul after death, but saw this afterlife as meaningless.<ref>Mikalson pg.178</ref> In the underworld, the identity of a dead person still existed, but it had no strength or true influence. Rather, the continuation of the existence of the soul in the underworld was considered a remembrance of the fact that the dead person had existed, yet while the soul still existed, it was inactive.<ref>Mystakidou pg.25</ref> However, the price of death was considered a great one. Homer believed that the best possible existence for humans was to never be born at all, or die soon after birth, because the greatness of life could never balance the price of death.<ref>Mystakidou pg.24</ref> The Greek gods only rewarded heroes who were still living; heroes that died were ignored in the afterlife. However, it was considered very important to the Greeks to honor the dead and was seen as a type of piety. Those who did not respect the dead opened themselves to the punishment of the gods &ndash; for example, Odysseus ensured Ajax's burial, or the gods would be angered.<ref>Garland pg.8</ref>\n\n==Myths and stories==\n\n===Orpheus===\n[[Orpheus]], a poet and musician that had almost supernatural abilities to move anyone to his music, descended to the underworld as a living mortal to retrieve his dead wife [[Eurydice]] after she was bitten by a poisonous snake on their wedding day. With his lyre-playing skills, he was able to put a spell on the guardians of the underworld and move them with his music.<ref>Albinus pg.105</ref> With his beautiful voice he was able to convince Hades and Persephone to allow him and his wife to return to the living. The rulers of the underworld agreed, but under one condition &ndash; Eurydice would have to follow behind Orpheus and he could not turn around to look at her. Once Orpheus reached the entrance, he turned around, longing to look at his beautiful wife, only to watch as his wife faded back into the underworld. He was forbidden to return to the underworld a second time and he spent his life playing his music to the birds and the mountains.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Edith|title=The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice|url=http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/webtexts/eurydice/eurydicemyth.html|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hades in Christianity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Albinus\n  | first = Lars\n  | year = 2000\n  | title = The House of Hades: Studies in Ancient Greek Eschatology\n  | publisher = Aarhus University Press\n  | location = Aarhus\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Buxton\n  | first = R\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = The complete World of Greek Mythology\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/completeworldofg00rich\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Thames & Hudson Ltd.\n  | location = London\n  }}\n* {{cite web|last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html|accessdate=3 December 2012}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Fairbanks\n | first = Arthur\n | year = 1900\n | title = The Chthonic Gods of Greek Religion\n | journal = The American Journal of Philology\n | volume = 21\n | issue = 3\n | pages = 241\u2013259\n | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n | jstor = 287716\n | doi = 10.2307/287716\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Garland\n  | first = Robert\n  | year = 1985\n  | title = The Greek Way of Death\n  | publisher = Duckworth\n  | location = London\n  }} \n* {{cite journal|last=Leeming|first=David|title=Demeter and Persephone|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-407#|journal=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 December 2012|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001|year=2005|isbn=9780195156690}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Leeming|first=David|title=Styx|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-1497?rskey=rTReql&result=1320&q=|journal=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 December 2012|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001|year=2005|isbn=9780195156690}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Long\n | first = J.

Metal flashing materials include [[lead]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]],<ref name=\":0\" /> [[stainless steel]], [[Zinc|zinc alloy]], and other materials.\n\n== Etymology and related terms ==\nThe origin of the term ''flash'' and ''flashing'' are uncertain,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2009. Flash, n.4, flash, v.1, flashing,</ref> but may come from the Middle English verb ''flasshen'', 'to sprinkle, splash', related to ''flask''.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flashing referenced 04/12/2013</ref>\n\n''Counter-flashing'' (or ''cover flashing'', ''cap flashing'') is a term used when there are two parallel pieces of flashing employed together<ref>http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/counterflashing accessed 04/12/2013</ref> such as on a chimney, where the counter-flashing is built into the chimney and overlaps a replaceable piece of ''base flashing''. Strips of lead used for flashing an edge were sometimes called an ''apron'',<ref>Loudon, J. C.. An encyclop\u00e6dia of cottage, farm, and villa architecture and furniture; containing numerous designs for dwelling \u2026 each design accompanied by analytical and critical remarks .... London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833. 126. Print.</ref> and the term is still used for the piece of flashing below a chimney. The up-hill side of a chimney may have a small gable-like assembly called a cricket with ''cricket flashing'' or on narrow chimneys with no cricket a ''back flashing'' or ''back pan flashing''. Flashing may be let into a groove in a wall or chimney called a ''[[reglet]]''.\n\n== Purpose ==\nBefore the availability of sheet products for flashing builders used creative methods to minimize water penetration such as angling roof shingles away from the joint, placing chimneys at the ridge, building steps into the sides of chimneys to throw off water and covering seams between roofing materials with mortar [[flaunching]]. The introduction of manufactured flashing decreased water penetration at obstacles such as chimneys, vent pipes, walls which abut roofs, window and door openings, etc. thus making buildings more durable and reducing indoor [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] problems. Moreover, flashing is important to ensure integrity of the roof prior to a [[solar panel]] installation.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Roof Flashing & Why is It Needed When Installing Solar Panels|url=http://www.allseasonsolar.net/roof-flashing-needed-installing-solar-panels/|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn builders books, by 1832 Loudons ''An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture...'' gives instruction on installing lead flashing and 1875 ''Notes on Building Construction'' gives detailed instruction and is well illustrated with methods still used today.<ref>Smith, Percy Guillemard Llewellyn.

Metal flashing should be provided with expansion joints on long runs to prevent deformation of the metal sheets due to expansion and contraction, and should not stain or be stained by adjacent materials or react chemically with them. An important type of potential chemical reaction between metal flashing materials is [[galvanic corrosion]]. Copper and lead cannot be used in contact with or even above aluminum, zinc, or coated steel without an increased risk of premature corrosion. Also, Aluminum and zinc flashing cannot be used in contact with pressure treated wood due to rapid corrosion. Aluminum is also damaged by wet mortar and wet plaster. [[Salt spray]] in coastal areas may accelerate corrosion. so stainless steel, copper, or coated aluminum are recommended flashing materials near salt water.\n\nTypes of ''flexible flashing'' products are [[rubberized asphalt]], [[butyl rubber]], [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (sometimes known as kylar or hylar), and acrylic.<ref>Charles Wardell, \"Flexible flashing:Tips For Getting the Most Out of These Useful Products\".

Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Hand-colouring is also known as hand painting or overpainting.\n\nTypically, [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[crayons]] or [[pastels]], and other [[paint]]s or [[dye]]s are applied to the image surface using [[brush]]es, fingers, [[cotton swab]]s or [[airbrush]]es. Hand-coloured photographs were most popular in the mid- to late-19th century before the invention of [[color photography|colour photography]] and some firms specialised in producing hand-coloured photographs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[Monochrome]] (black and white) [[photography]] was first exemplified by the [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: [[calotype]], [[ambrotype]], [[tintype]], [[albumen print]] and [[Gelatin-silver process|gelatin silver print]]. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing [[color photography|colour photography]] as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of [[cyanotype]]s.\n\nIn an attempt to create more realistic images, photographers and artists would hand-colour monochrome photographs. \nThe first hand-coloured daguerreotypes are attributed to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] painter and printmaker [[Johann Baptist Isenring]], who used a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[pigment]]s to colour daguerreotypes soon after their invention in 1839.<ref>Henisch, H.K. & Henisch, B. (1996). ''The painted photograph 1939-1914: Origins, techniques, aspirations''. Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 21.</ref> Coloured powder was fixed on the delicate surface of the daguerreotype by the application of heat. Variations of this technique were patented in [[England]] by [[Richard Beard (photographer)|Richard Beard]] in 1842 and in [[France]] by \u00c9tienne Lecchi in 1842 and L\u00e9otard de Leuze in 1845. Later, hand-colouring was used with successive photographic innovations, from albumen and gelatin silver prints to [[Magic lantern|lantern slides]]<ref>Robinson, D., Herbert, S., Crangle, R., & Magic Lantern Society of Great Britain. (2001). ''Encyclopaedia of the magic lantern''. London: Magic Lantern Society, p. 73-74.</ref> and [[Transparency (photography)|transparency photography]].\n\nParallel efforts to produce coloured photographic images affected the popularity of hand-colouring. In 1842 [[Daniel Davis Jr. (photographer)|Daniel Davis Jr.]] patented a method for colouring daguerreotypes through [[electroplating]],<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 24.</ref> and his work was refined by [[Warren Thompson (photographer)|Warren Thompson]] the following year. The results of the work of Davis and Thompson were only partially successful in creating colour photographs and the electroplating method was soon abandoned. In 1850 [[Levi Hill|Levi L. Hill]] announced his invention of a process of daguerreotyping in natural colours in his ''Treatise on Daguerreotype''.<ref>Hill, L. L., & McCartey, W. (1973). A treatise on daguerreotype. ''The Literature of photography''. New York: Arno Press.</ref> Sales of conventional uncoloured and hand-coloured daguerreotypes fell in anticipation of this new technology. Hill delayed publication of the details of his process for several years, however, and his claims soon came to be considered fraudulent. When he finally did publish his treatise in 1856, the process&nbsp;\u2013 whether bona fide or not&nbsp;\u2013 was certainly impractical and dangerous.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHand-colouring remained the easiest and most effective method to produce full-colour photographic images until the mid-20th century when American [[Kodak]] introduced [[Kodachrome]] colour film.\n\n====Japanese hand-coloured photographs (circa 1860\u20131899)====\n\n{{multiple image\n | width             = 200px\n | header            = \n | image1            = Takaboko Island bw.jpg\n | caption1          = Original monochrome photo\n | image2            = Takaboko Island hc.jpg\n | caption2          = Hand-colored version\n | footer            = Print by [[Stillfried & Andersen]] between 1875 and 1885\n}}\n\nThough the hand-colouring of photographs was introduced in [[Europe]], the technique gained considerable popularity in [[Japan]], where the practice became a respected and refined art form beginning in the 1860s. It is possible that photographer Charles Parker and his artist partner William Parke Andrew were the first to produce such works in Japan, but the first to consistently employ hand-colouring in the country were the photographer [[Felice Beato]] and his partner, ''The Illustrated London News'' artist and colourist [[Charles Wirgman]].<ref name=\"Henisch. 1996. p. 201\">Henisch. (1996). p. 201.</ref> In Beato's studio the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] were successfully applied to European photography, as evidenced in Beato's volume of hand-coloured portraits, ''Native Types''.\n\nAnother notable early photographer in Japan to use hand-colouring was [[Yokoyama Matsusabur\u014d]]. Yokoyama had trained as a painter and lithographer as well as a photographer, and he took advantage of his extensive repertoire of skills and techniques to create what he called ''shashin abura-e'' (\u5199\u771f\u6cb9\u7d75) or \"photographic oil paintings\", in which the paper support of a photograph was cut away and oil paints then applied to the remaining emulsion.<ref>Yokoe, F.

Many high-quality hand-coloured photographs continued to be made in Japan well into the 20th century.\n\n===Post-1900===\n[[File:Soviet POWs Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|Digitally-colourised picture of Finnish POWs, 6th January 1940. The picture has been restored and edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]].]]\n\nThe so-called golden age of hand-coloured photography in the western hemisphere occurred between 1900 and 1940.<ref>Ivankovich, M. & Ivankovich, S. (2005). ''Early twentieth century hand-painted photography: Identification and value.'' Kentucky: Collector Books. p. 11.</ref> The increased demand for hand-coloured [[landscape photography]] at the beginning of the 20th century is attributed to the work of [[Wallace Nutting]].  Nutting, a New England minister, pursued hand-coloured landscape photography as a hobby until 1904, when he opened a professional studio.  He spent the next 35 years creating hand-coloured photographs, and became the best-selling hand-coloured photographer of all time.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\">Ivankovich. (2005). p. 12</ref>\n\nBetween 1915 and 1925 hand-coloured photographs were popular among the middle classes in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Bahamas as affordable and stylish wedding gifts, shower gifts, holiday gifts, friendship gifts, and vacation souvenirs. With the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, and the subsequent decrease in the numbers of the middle class, sales of hand-coloured photographs sharply diminished.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\"/>\n\nDespite their downturn in popularity, skilled photographers continued to create beautifully hand-coloured photographs.  [[Hans Bellmer|Hans Bellmer's]] hand-coloured photographs of his own doll sculptures from the 1930s provide an example of continued hand-colouring of photographs in Europe during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|title=Page Not Found|first=George Eastman|last=Museum|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194321/http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|archive-date=27 September 2007|df=}}</ref> In Poland, the [[Monid\u0142o]] is an example of popular hand-coloured wedding photographs.\n\nAnother hand-colour photographer, Luis M\u00e1rquez (1899\u20131978), was the official photographer for and art adviser of the Mexican Pavilion at the 1939-40 World\u2019s Fair. In 1937 he presented Texas Governor [[James V. Allred]] a collection of hand-coloured photographs. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in Mexico City has an extensive Luis M\u00e1rquez photographic archive, as does the [[University of Houston]] in Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.uh.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=/p15195coll13|title=University of Houston Digital Library: Luis Marquez Photographs|last=|first=|date=|website=digital.lib.uh.edu|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1950s, the availability of colour film all but stopped the production of hand-coloured photographs. The upsurge in popularity of antiques and collectibles in the 1960s, however, increased interest in hand-coloured photographs. Since about 1970 there has been something of a revival of hand-colouring, as seen in the work of such artist-photographers as Elizabeth Lennard, [[Jan Saudek]], [[Kathy Vargas]], and Rita Dibert.  [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg's]] and others' use of combined photographic and painting media in their art represents a precursor to this revival.\n\nIn spite of the availability of high-quality [[Color photography|colour processes]], hand-coloured photographs (often combined with [[sepia toning]]) are still popular for aesthetic reasons and because the pigments used have great permanence. In many countries where colour film was rare or expensive, or where colour processing was unavailable, hand-colouring continued to be used and sometimes preferred into the 1980s. More recently, [[digital image processing]] has been used&nbsp;\u2013 particularly in advertising&nbsp;\u2013 to recreate the appearance and effects of hand-colouring. Colourisation is now available to the amateur photographer using image manipulation software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].\n\n==Materials and techniques==\n[[File:Scan konghungs 2019-10-23-16-29-41 copy.jpg|thumb|Hand Coloured Picture of a Noble Manchurian Lady in 1910s China]]\n\n===Dyes===\n[[Dyes|Basic dyes]] are used in the hand-colouring of photographs.  Dyes are soluble colour substance, either natural or synthetic, in an aqueous solution, as opposed to pigments which are generally insoluble colour substance in an aqueous suspension.  [[Aniline dye]]s, the first synthetically produced dyes originally used for the dyeing of textiles, were first used to dye [[albumen print]]s and [[Transparency (photography)|glass transparency]] photographs in Germany in the 1860s.<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 65.</ref>  When hand-colouring with [[dye]]s, a weak [[solution]] of dye in water is preferred, and colours are often built up with repeated washes rather than being applied all at once. The approach is to ''stain'' or ''dye'' the print rather than to ''paint'' it, as too much paint will obscure photographic details. Blotting paper is used to control the amount of dye on the surface by absorbing any excess.\n\n===Watercolours===\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolour paint]] has the virtue of being more permanent than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours requires the use of a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring.<ref>Johnston, C. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs]. (Master\u2019s dissertation). The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.</ref> Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally [[arabic gum]]), additives to improve plasticity (such as [[glycerol|glycerine]]), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. [[water]]) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often \"leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area.\"<ref name=\"utexas2004\">Johnston. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs].</ref> Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.\n\n===Oils===\n[[Oil paint]] contains particles of pigment applied using a [[drying oil]], such as [[linseed oil]]. The conventions and techniques of using [[Oil paint|oils]] demands a knowledge of [[drawing]] and [[painting]], so it is often used in professional practice. {{citation needed span|text=When hand-colouring with oils, the approach is more often to use the photographic image simply as a base for a painted image. The ability to create accurate oil portraits using a photographic base lent itself to art crime, with some artists claiming to paint traditional oil portraits (for a higher price) when actually tracing a photograph base in oils. Therefore, the choice of oil colours is governed by the relative transparency of the pigments to allow for authentication of the photographic base.|date=December 2017}} It is necessary to [[Sizing|size]] the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic [[Magic lantern|lantern]] slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results.<ref>Robinson. (2001). p. 73-74.</ref> Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the [[Collodion process|collodion]] era&nbsp;\u2013 from 1848 to the end of the 19th century&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes watercolours were used as well.\n\n===Crayons and pastels===\nThe use of [[crayon]] or [[pastel]] sticks of ground pigments in various levels of saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques.  Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and coloured pencils are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.\n\nHand-coloured photographs sometimes include the combined use of dyes, water-colours, oils, and other pigments to create varying effects on the printed image. Regardless of which medium is used, the main tools to apply colour are the brush and fingertip. Often the dabbing finger is covered to ensure that no fingerprints are left on the image.\n\n==Preservation and storage==\n[[File:Unidentified woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A tarnished hand-coloured daguerreotype (c. 1852) from the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677483953/|title=Unidentified Woman|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>]]\nIn general, the preservation of hand-coloured photographs is similar to that of [[Color photography#Preservation issues|colour and monochrome photography]]. Optimal storage conditions include an environmentally controlled climate with low [[relative humidity]] (approximately 30-40% RH), temperatures under 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and a low concentration of [[particulate|particulate pollution]], such as [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]], and [[ozone]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Library of Congress. (2007). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/photo.html ''Caring for your photographic collections'']. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> The storage area must also be clean and free of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mould]].  Because hand-coloured photographs, like colour photographs, are more sensitive to light and UV radiation, storage should be in a dark location.  The storage area should be secure and monitored for internal threats&nbsp;\u2013 such as change in temperature or humidity due to [[HVAC]] malfunction, as well as external threats, such as [[theft]] or [[natural disaster]].  A [[Emergency management|disaster plan]] should be created and maintained for all materials.\n\nWhen handling cased photographs such as [[daguerreotypes]], [[albumen print]]s, and [[tintypes]], especially ones that have been hand-coloured, caution is required.  They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image.  Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] or buffered tissue paper.  If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and backing board can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board.  The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the backing board supports the image from behind.  This \"sandwich\" is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners should not be used on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards.  If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.<ref>[[Ritzenthaler, M. L.]], Vogt-O'Connor, D., & Ritzenthaler, L. (2006).

Like the photographs themselves, watercolours and dyes applied by hand to photographs are susceptible to light damage and must be housed in dark storage or displayed under dim, indirect light. Common particulate pollutants can cause watercolour pigments to fade, but the paint surface can be cleaned by lightly dusting with a soft brush to remove dirt.<ref>Fahey, M. (2002).

(2005). p. 251.</ref>  Early 20th century hand-coloured photographs were often mounted on [[Mat (picture framing)|mat-board]], placed behind a glass frame, and backed by wood panel slats, cardboard, or heavy paperboard.  A backing sheet was often glued to the back of the mat-board.  Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly [[acidic]] and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs.  Metallic inclusions in the paper can also [[oxidize]] which may be the cause of [[foxing]] in paper materials.  Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.\n\nSimple conservation of these fragile materials can be carried out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together.  Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic backing paper can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the backing paper.  The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting.  Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality [[acid-free paper]] paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.<ref>Ivankovich. (2005). p. 251-253.</ref>\n\n==Related techniques==\nHand-colouring should be distinguished from ''tinting'', ''toning'', ''retouching'', and ''crystoleum''.\n\n* [[Tinted photograph]]s are made with dyed [[Photographic paper|printing papers]] produced by commercial manufacturers. A single overall colour underlies the image and is most apparent in the highlights and mid-tones. From the 1870s [[albumen print|albumen]] printing papers were available in pale pink or blue, and from the 1890s gelatin-silver printing-out papers in pale mauve or pink were available. There were other kinds of tinted papers as well. Over time such colouration often becomes very faded.\n* [[Photographic print toning|Toning]] refers to a variety of methods for altering the overall colour of the photographic image itself.<ref>* [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=toning&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=-1&checked=300053423 Art & Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. \"toning (photography)\"]. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Compounds of gold, platinum or other metals are used in combination with variations in development time, temperature and other factors to produce a range of tones, including warm browns, purples, sepias, blues, olives, red-browns and blue-blacks. A well-known type of toning is [[sepia tone]]. Besides adding colour to a monochromatic print, toning often improves image stability and increases contrast.\n* [[Retouching]] uses many of the same tools and techniques as hand-colouring, but with the intent of covering damage, hiding unwanted features, accentuating details, or adding missing elements in a photographic print. In a portrait retouching could be used to improve a sitter's appearance, for instance, by removing facial blemishes, and in a landscape with an overexposed sky, clouds could be painted into the image. Water-colours, inks, dyes and chemical reducers are used with such tools as [[scalpel]]s, pointed brushes, airbrushes and retouching pencils.\n* The [[crystoleum]], from \"crystal\" + \"oleum\" (oil), process was yet another method of applying colour to albumen prints.<ref>Ritzenthaler. (2006). p. 39.</ref>  The print was pasted face down to the inside of a concave piece of glass.  Once the adhesive (usually [[starch]] paste or [[gelatin]]) was dry, the paper backing of the print was rubbed away, leaving only the transparent emulsion on the glass. The image was then coloured by hand.  Another piece of glass was added to the back and this could also be coloured by hand.  Both pieces of glass were bound together creating a detailed, albeit fragile, image.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Film colorization]]\n* [[Film tinting]]\n* [[Handschiegl color process|Handschiegl colour process]]\n* [[Photochrom|Photochrom(e)]]\n* [[Photograph conservation]]\n* [[Photo manipulation]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n* [[Selective color|Selective colour]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baldwin, G.

Hand-coloured photographs were most popular in the mid- to late-19th century before the invention of [[color photography|colour photography]] and some firms specialised in producing hand-coloured photographs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[Monochrome]] (black and white) [[photography]] was first exemplified by the [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: [[calotype]], [[ambrotype]], [[tintype]], [[albumen print]] and [[Gelatin-silver process|gelatin silver print]]. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing [[color photography|colour photography]] as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of [[cyanotype]]s.\n\nIn an attempt to create more realistic images, photographers and artists would hand-colour monochrome photographs. \nThe first hand-coloured daguerreotypes are attributed to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] painter and printmaker [[Johann Baptist Isenring]], who used a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[pigment]]s to colour daguerreotypes soon after their invention in 1839.<ref>Henisch, H.K. & Henisch, B.

London: Magic Lantern Society, p. 73-74.</ref> and [[Transparency (photography)|transparency photography]].\n\nParallel efforts to produce coloured photographic images affected the popularity of hand-colouring. In 1842 [[Daniel Davis Jr. (photographer)|Daniel Davis Jr.]] patented a method for colouring daguerreotypes through [[electroplating]],<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 24.</ref> and his work was refined by [[Warren Thompson (photographer)|Warren Thompson]] the following year. The results of the work of Davis and Thompson were only partially successful in creating colour photographs and the electroplating method was soon abandoned. In 1850 [[Levi Hill|Levi L. Hill]] announced his invention of a process of daguerreotyping in natural colours in his ''Treatise on Daguerreotype''.<ref>Hill, L. L., & McCartey, W. (1973). A treatise on daguerreotype. ''The Literature of photography''. New York: Arno Press.</ref> Sales of conventional uncoloured and hand-coloured daguerreotypes fell in anticipation of this new technology. Hill delayed publication of the details of his process for several years, however, and his claims soon came to be considered fraudulent. When he finally did publish his treatise in 1856, the process&nbsp;\u2013 whether bona fide or not&nbsp;\u2013 was certainly impractical and dangerous.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHand-colouring remained the easiest and most effective method to produce full-colour photographic images until the mid-20th century when American [[Kodak]] introduced [[Kodachrome]] colour film.\n\n====Japanese hand-coloured photographs (circa 1860\u20131899)====\n\n{{multiple image\n | width             = 200px\n | header            = \n | image1            = Takaboko Island bw.jpg\n | caption1          = Original monochrome photo\n | image2            = Takaboko Island hc.jpg\n | caption2          = Hand-colored version\n | footer            = Print by [[Stillfried & Andersen]] between 1875 and 1885\n}}\n\nThough the hand-colouring of photographs was introduced in [[Europe]], the technique gained considerable popularity in [[Japan]], where the practice became a respected and refined art form beginning in the 1860s. It is possible that photographer Charles Parker and his artist partner William Parke Andrew were the first to produce such works in Japan, but the first to consistently employ hand-colouring in the country were the photographer [[Felice Beato]] and his partner, ''The Illustrated London News'' artist and colourist [[Charles Wirgman]].<ref name=\"Henisch. 1996. p. 201\">Henisch. (1996). p. 201.</ref> In Beato's studio the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] were successfully applied to European photography, as evidenced in Beato's volume of hand-coloured portraits, ''Native Types''.\n\nAnother notable early photographer in Japan to use hand-colouring was [[Yokoyama Matsusabur\u014d]]. Yokoyama had trained as a painter and lithographer as well as a photographer, and he took advantage of his extensive repertoire of skills and techniques to create what he called ''shashin abura-e'' (\u5199\u771f\u6cb9\u7d75) or \"photographic oil paintings\", in which the paper support of a photograph was cut away and oil paints then applied to the remaining emulsion.<ref>Yokoe, F.

Many high-quality hand-coloured photographs continued to be made in Japan well into the 20th century.\n\n===Post-1900===\n[[File:Soviet POWs Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|Digitally-colourised picture of Finnish POWs, 6th January 1940. The picture has been restored and edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]].]]\n\nThe so-called golden age of hand-coloured photography in the western hemisphere occurred between 1900 and 1940.<ref>Ivankovich, M. & Ivankovich, S. (2005). ''Early twentieth century hand-painted photography: Identification and value.'' Kentucky: Collector Books. p. 11.</ref> The increased demand for hand-coloured [[landscape photography]] at the beginning of the 20th century is attributed to the work of [[Wallace Nutting]].  Nutting, a New England minister, pursued hand-coloured landscape photography as a hobby until 1904, when he opened a professional studio.  He spent the next 35 years creating hand-coloured photographs, and became the best-selling hand-coloured photographer of all time.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\">Ivankovich. (2005). p. 12</ref>\n\nBetween 1915 and 1925 hand-coloured photographs were popular among the middle classes in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Bahamas as affordable and stylish wedding gifts, shower gifts, holiday gifts, friendship gifts, and vacation souvenirs. With the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, and the subsequent decrease in the numbers of the middle class, sales of hand-coloured photographs sharply diminished.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\"/>\n\nDespite their downturn in popularity, skilled photographers continued to create beautifully hand-coloured photographs.  [[Hans Bellmer|Hans Bellmer's]] hand-coloured photographs of his own doll sculptures from the 1930s provide an example of continued hand-colouring of photographs in Europe during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|title=Page Not Found|first=George Eastman|last=Museum|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194321/http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|archive-date=27 September 2007|df=}}</ref> In Poland, the [[Monid\u0142o]] is an example of popular hand-coloured wedding photographs.\n\nAnother hand-colour photographer, Luis M\u00e1rquez (1899\u20131978), was the official photographer for and art adviser of the Mexican Pavilion at the 1939-40 World\u2019s Fair. In 1937 he presented Texas Governor [[James V. Allred]] a collection of hand-coloured photographs. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in Mexico City has an extensive Luis M\u00e1rquez photographic archive, as does the [[University of Houston]] in Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.uh.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=/p15195coll13|title=University of Houston Digital Library: Luis Marquez Photographs|last=|first=|date=|website=digital.lib.uh.edu|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1950s, the availability of colour film all but stopped the production of hand-coloured photographs. The upsurge in popularity of antiques and collectibles in the 1960s, however, increased interest in hand-coloured photographs. Since about 1970 there has been something of a revival of hand-colouring, as seen in the work of such artist-photographers as Elizabeth Lennard, [[Jan Saudek]], [[Kathy Vargas]], and Rita Dibert.  [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg's]] and others' use of combined photographic and painting media in their art represents a precursor to this revival.\n\nIn spite of the availability of high-quality [[Color photography|colour processes]], hand-coloured photographs (often combined with [[sepia toning]]) are still popular for aesthetic reasons and because the pigments used have great permanence. In many countries where colour film was rare or expensive, or where colour processing was unavailable, hand-colouring continued to be used and sometimes preferred into the 1980s. More recently, [[digital image processing]] has been used&nbsp;\u2013 particularly in advertising&nbsp;\u2013 to recreate the appearance and effects of hand-colouring. Colourisation is now available to the amateur photographer using image manipulation software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].\n\n==Materials and techniques==\n[[File:Scan konghungs 2019-10-23-16-29-41 copy.jpg|thumb|Hand Coloured Picture of a Noble Manchurian Lady in 1910s China]]\n\n===Dyes===\n[[Dyes|Basic dyes]] are used in the hand-colouring of photographs.  Dyes are soluble colour substance, either natural or synthetic, in an aqueous solution, as opposed to pigments which are generally insoluble colour substance in an aqueous suspension.  [[Aniline dye]]s, the first synthetically produced dyes originally used for the dyeing of textiles, were first used to dye [[albumen print]]s and [[Transparency (photography)|glass transparency]] photographs in Germany in the 1860s.<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 65.</ref>  When hand-colouring with [[dye]]s, a weak [[solution]] of dye in water is preferred, and colours are often built up with repeated washes rather than being applied all at once. The approach is to ''stain'' or ''dye'' the print rather than to ''paint'' it, as too much paint will obscure photographic details. Blotting paper is used to control the amount of dye on the surface by absorbing any excess.\n\n===Watercolours===\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolour paint]] has the virtue of being more permanent than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours requires the use of a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring.<ref>Johnston, C. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs]. (Master\u2019s dissertation). The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.</ref> Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally [[arabic gum]]), additives to improve plasticity (such as [[glycerol|glycerine]]), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. [[water]]) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often \"leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area.\"<ref name=\"utexas2004\">Johnston. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs].</ref> Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.\n\n===Oils===\n[[Oil paint]] contains particles of pigment applied using a [[drying oil]], such as [[linseed oil]]. The conventions and techniques of using [[Oil paint|oils]] demands a knowledge of [[drawing]] and [[painting]], so it is often used in professional practice. {{citation needed span|text=When hand-colouring with oils, the approach is more often to use the photographic image simply as a base for a painted image. The ability to create accurate oil portraits using a photographic base lent itself to art crime, with some artists claiming to paint traditional oil portraits (for a higher price) when actually tracing a photograph base in oils. Therefore, the choice of oil colours is governed by the relative transparency of the pigments to allow for authentication of the photographic base.|date=December 2017}} It is necessary to [[Sizing|size]] the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic [[Magic lantern|lantern]] slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results.<ref>Robinson. (2001). p. 73-74.</ref> Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the [[Collodion process|collodion]] era&nbsp;\u2013 from 1848 to the end of the 19th century&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes watercolours were used as well.\n\n===Crayons and pastels===\nThe use of [[crayon]] or [[pastel]] sticks of ground pigments in various levels of saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques.  Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and coloured pencils are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.\n\nHand-coloured photographs sometimes include the combined use of dyes, water-colours, oils, and other pigments to create varying effects on the printed image. Regardless of which medium is used, the main tools to apply colour are the brush and fingertip. Often the dabbing finger is covered to ensure that no fingerprints are left on the image.\n\n==Preservation and storage==\n[[File:Unidentified woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A tarnished hand-coloured daguerreotype (c. 1852) from the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677483953/|title=Unidentified Woman|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>]]\nIn general, the preservation of hand-coloured photographs is similar to that of [[Color photography#Preservation issues|colour and monochrome photography]]. Optimal storage conditions include an environmentally controlled climate with low [[relative humidity]] (approximately 30-40% RH), temperatures under 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and a low concentration of [[particulate|particulate pollution]], such as [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]], and [[ozone]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Library of Congress. (2007). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/photo.html ''Caring for your photographic collections'']. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> The storage area must also be clean and free of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[mold|mould]].  Because hand-coloured photographs, like colour photographs, are more sensitive to light and UV radiation, storage should be in a dark location.  The storage area should be secure and monitored for internal threats&nbsp;\u2013 such as change in temperature or humidity due to [[HVAC]] malfunction, as well as external threats, such as [[theft]] or [[natural disaster]].  A [[Emergency management|disaster plan]] should be created and maintained for all materials.\n\nWhen handling cased photographs such as [[daguerreotypes]], [[albumen print]]s, and [[tintypes]], especially ones that have been hand-coloured, caution is required.  They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image.  Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] or buffered tissue paper.  If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and backing board can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board.  The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the backing board supports the image from behind.  This \"sandwich\" is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners should not be used on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards.  If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.<ref>[[Ritzenthaler, M. L.]], Vogt-O'Connor, D., & Ritzenthaler, L. (2006).

Like the photographs themselves, watercolours and dyes applied by hand to photographs are susceptible to light damage and must be housed in dark storage or displayed under dim, indirect light. Common particulate pollutants can cause watercolour pigments to fade, but the paint surface can be cleaned by lightly dusting with a soft brush to remove dirt.<ref>Fahey, M. (2002).

Historically, crayon and pastel coloured photographs were sold in a frame under a protective layer of glass, which was often successful in reducing the amount of handling and smudging of the photograph surface.<ref>Burns, S. B. (1995). ''Forgotten marriage: The painted tintype & the decorative frame 1860-1910: A lost chapter in American portraiture.'' New York: The Burns Press. p. 40.</ref> Any conservation work on crayon or pastel colour-photographs must retain these original frames and original glass to maintain the authenticity and value of the object. If the photograph is separated from its original enclosure, it can be stored in an archival quality folder until it is framed or cased.\n\n===Auxiliary materials===\n[[File:Carandini.jpg|thumb|upright|Hand-coloured cabinet photograph (c. 1875) from the State Library of New South Wales.

(2005). p. 251.</ref>  Early 20th century hand-coloured photographs were often mounted on [[Mat (picture framing)|mat-board]], placed behind a glass frame, and backed by wood panel slats, cardboard, or heavy paperboard.  A backing sheet was often glued to the back of the mat-board.  Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly [[acidic]] and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs.  Metallic inclusions in the paper can also [[oxidize]] which may be the cause of [[foxing]] in paper materials.  Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.\n\nSimple conservation of these fragile materials can be carried out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together.  Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic backing paper can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the backing paper.  The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting.  Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality [[acid-free paper]] paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.<ref>Ivankovich. (2005). p. 251-253.</ref>\n\n==Related techniques==\nHand-colouring should be distinguished from ''tinting'', ''toning'', ''retouching'', and ''crystoleum''.\n\n* [[Tinted photograph]]s are made with dyed [[Photographic paper|printing papers]] produced by commercial manufacturers. A single overall colour underlies the image and is most apparent in the highlights and mid-tones. From the 1870s [[albumen print|albumen]] printing papers were available in pale pink or blue, and from the 1890s gelatin-silver printing-out papers in pale mauve or pink were available. There were other kinds of tinted papers as well. Over time such colouration often becomes very faded.\n* [[Photographic print toning|Toning]] refers to a variety of methods for altering the overall colour of the photographic image itself.<ref>* [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=toning&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=-1&checked=300053423 Art & Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. \"toning (photography)\"]. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Compounds of gold, platinum or other metals are used in combination with variations in development time, temperature and other factors to produce a range of tones, including warm browns, purples, sepias, blues, olives, red-browns and blue-blacks. A well-known type of toning is [[sepia tone]]. Besides adding colour to a monochromatic print, toning often improves image stability and increases contrast.\n* [[Retouching]] uses many of the same tools and techniques as hand-colouring, but with the intent of covering damage, hiding unwanted features, accentuating details, or adding missing elements in a photographic print. In a portrait retouching could be used to improve a sitter's appearance, for instance, by removing facial blemishes, and in a landscape with an overexposed sky, clouds could be painted into the image. Water-colours, inks, dyes and chemical reducers are used with such tools as [[scalpel]]s, pointed brushes, airbrushes and retouching pencils.\n* The [[crystoleum]], from \"crystal\" + \"oleum\" (oil), process was yet another method of applying colour to albumen prints.<ref>Ritzenthaler. (2006). p. 39.</ref>  The print was pasted face down to the inside of a concave piece of glass.  Once the adhesive (usually [[starch]] paste or [[gelatin]]) was dry, the paper backing of the print was rubbed away, leaving only the transparent emulsion on the glass. The image was then coloured by hand.  Another piece of glass was added to the back and this could also be coloured by hand.  Both pieces of glass were bound together creating a detailed, albeit fragile, image.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Film colorization]]\n* [[Film tinting]]\n* [[Handschiegl color process|Handschiegl colour process]]\n* [[Photochrom|Photochrom(e)]]\n* [[Photograph conservation]]\n* [[Photo manipulation]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n* [[Selective color|Selective colour]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baldwin, G.

''Euphorbia candelabrum''<nowiki/>'s success as a tall succulent seems to be a result of over-grazing by African mammals such as the [[Ugandan kob]] (Kobus kob Erxleben) and [[Ugandan water buck|Uganda water\u2010buck]] (Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa Ogilby) and an overall decrease in intense wildfires.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSome authorities further divide this species into two varieties, ''[[Euphorbia candelabrum var. bilocularis]]'' and ''[[Euphorbia candelabrum var. candelabrum]]''.\n\n''Euphorbia candelabrum'' was used in traditional Ethiopian medicine. Mixed with clarified [[honey]], its sap was used as a purgative to cure [[syphilis]], and when mixed with other medicinal plants as a salve to treat the symptoms of [[leprosy]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), pp. 76, 91</ref> This plant currently has negligible commercial value, although [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] documents two different attempts near [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] in [[Eritrea]] to collect its gum before 1935, but neither attempt proved commercially viable.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 206</ref>\n\nIn terms of agro-forestry purposes, ''Euphorbia candelabrum'' has been used in firewood, timber, and fencing. Its wood is light and durable with a number of purposes including roofing, tables, doors, matches, boxes, mortars, musical instruments and saddles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Dangers ==\nWhen structural damage occurs, ''Euphorbia candelabrum'' trees release an abundant amount of milky-white latex, which has a rubber content of 12.5%. This latex is extremely toxic due to its skin irritant and carcinogenic [[diterpene]] derivatives, mainly [[phorbol esters]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Uzabakiliho|first=B.|last2=Largeau|first2=C.|last3=Casadevall|first3=E.|date=1987|title=Latex constituents of Euphorbia candelabrum, E. grantii, E. tirucalli and Synadenium grantii|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0031-9422(00)84589-6|journal=Phytochemistry|volume=26|issue=11|pages=3041\u20133045|doi=10.1016/s0031-9422(00)84589-6|issn=0031-9422}}</ref> In addition to irritation of the skin and mucous membranes, ''E. candelabrum'' latex may cause blindness if brought into contact with the eyes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVarious components of ''E. candelabrum'' plants can be utilized as poisons.

In addition to this, baboon feeding patterns affect the life cycle of ''E. candelabrum'' flowers and often causes sterility in many of the young stems<ref name=\":3\" />.\n\n== Medicinal Use ==\nAlthough ''Euphorbia candelabrum'' is known to be quite toxic, it has multiple medicinal uses. Its latex contains highly irritant ingenol diterpene esters which proves to be both harmful and helpful. On top of blistering and irritation, ingenol products demonstrate tumour-promoting activity, causing cells to resist [[apoptosis]] and continue multiplying.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, ingenol is beneficial in the respect that it encourages anti-[[HIV]] and anti-[[leukemia]] cellular activity which protects [[T cell|T-cells]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Kee-Jong|last2=Lee|first2=Hak Sung|last3=Kim|first3=Yeong-Shik|last4=Kim|first4=Sung Soon|date=September 2011|title=Ingenol Protects Human T Cells From HIV-1 Infection|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24159460|journal=Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives|volume=2|issue=2|pages=109\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.phrp.2011.07.001|issn=2210-9099|pmc=3766915|pmid=24159460}}</ref> A 1961 study found that three out of 40 mice contracted papilloma when treated with DMBA only, meanwhile only 3 out of 100 mice developed papilloma when treated with ''Euphorbia'' latices, indicating that plants from the family ''Euphorbiaceae'' are highly effective antineoplastic agents <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=F.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.
