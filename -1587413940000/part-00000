It is set in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] on Sarah's Mountain, a fictional mountain in [[Kentucky]], near the [[Ohio River]], that is being encroached upon by a mining company. The book highlights the strange, almost surreal customs of the [[Appalachia|hill people]], including their traditions of song and superstition.

Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months\u2019 trek they reached the Brahmaputra River.

In 1954, shortly after giving the monastic vows, Karmapa turned to Chogyam Trungp Rinpoche and said, \"In the future you will bring Dharma to the West.\" At the time, his students wondered what in the world could he be talking about. <ref>Bausch, Gerd, Radiant Compassion, The Life of the 16th Gyalway Karmapa, Volume 1, 2018 pp. 164-165</ref>\n\nIn exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. In collaboration with Freda Bedi, who had initiated the project,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Accomplishments of Freda Bedi, in Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor.

In 1970, after a break with Akong, Trungpa moved to the United States at the invitation of several students.\n\nShortly after his move to Scotland, a variety of experiences, including a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to give up his monastic vows and work as a lay teacher.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Born in Tibet, 1977 edition, Epilogue</ref> He made that decision principally to mitigate students' becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.\n\nUpon moving to the United States in 1970, Trungpa traveled throughout North America, gaining renown for his ability to present the essence of the highest Buddhist teachings in a form readily understandable to Western students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.<ref>last paragraph is exact quote from http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php</ref>\n\n===Introduction of the Vajrayana===\nTrungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce the esoteric practice of the [[Vajrayana]] to the West. According to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, \"The one who mainly spread the Vajrayana in the West was Trungpa Rinpoche.\"<ref>Interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche; 17 September 2003 [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315125527/http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html |date=2010-03-15 }}, after [http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php]</ref> In contrast to its traditional presentation in Tibet, where the esoteric practices are largely the domain of the monastic sangha, in the US Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana to the lay sangha.<ref>Dead but not lost: grief narratives in religious traditions By Robert Goss, Dennis Klass; p74</ref>\n\nThe presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa's former student Stephen Butterfield, \"Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies\".<ref>Butterfield 11</ref> Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the esoteric path.\n\nButterfield noted \"disquieting resemblances\" to cults, and \"to be part of Trungpa's inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did.\" But Butterfield also notes that \"This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism,\"<ref>Butterfield 12, 100</ref> and acknowledges that Trungpa's organization is anything but a cult: \"a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled.\"<ref>Butterfield 239</ref>\n\n===Meditation and education centers===\n[[File:Karme ch\u00f6ling purkong.jpg|thumb|The purkhang at [[Karm\u00ea Ch\u00f6ling]]|349x349px]]\nIn 1973, Trungpa established [[Vajradhatu]], encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as [[Shambhala International|Shambhala Meditation Centers]]. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes]], Colorado, [[Karm\u00ea Ch\u00f6ling]] in [[Barnet, Vermont|Barnet]], Vermont and [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nIn 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became [[Naropa University]], in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado.  Naropa was the first accredited [[Buddhist universities in the United States and Canada|Buddhist university]] in North America. Trungpa hired [[Allen Ginsberg]] to teach [[poetry]] and [[William Burroughs]] to teach [[literature]].\n\nTrungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were [[Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Diane di Prima]], [[Peter Lieberson]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles]], [[David Nichtern]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[David Deida]], [[Francisco Varela]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], who portrayed Trungpa in the song \"Refuge of the Roads\" on her 1976 album [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|title=What Kind of Buddhist was Steve Jobs, Really?|accessdate=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508054008/http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|archive-date=2017-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s [[Marianne Faithfull]] taught songwriting workshops.\nLesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] (n\u00e9 Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (n\u00e9 P. Howard Useche), [[Ezequiel Hernandez]] Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka [[Dorje Khandro]]), Francisco Salas Roche, and [[Francesca Fremantle]]. [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] promulgated Trungpa's teachings from a primarily [[Nyingma]] rather than Kagy\u00fc point of view at the Longchen Foundation.<ref>[http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html Longchen Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128075242/http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html |date=2012-01-28 }}</ref><ref>Rigdzin Shikpo 2007</ref>\n\n===Shambhala vision===\n\nIn 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the [[Shambhala Training]],<ref>Midal 2001, pp 233\u2013247</ref><ref>Trungpa 2004, Introduction to Volume 8</ref> inspired by his vision (see [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. Trungpa had actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.<ref>Midal 2005, pp 363\u2013364</ref>\n\nIn his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one's [[basic goodness]] and confidence. It is presented as a path that \"brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life.\" Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as ''sakyong'' (Tib. earth protector) with his wife as queen-consort or ''sakyong wangmo.''\n\nShambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'', provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his [[intention]] to propagate the [[Kings of Shambhala|kingdom of Shambala]] that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.<ref>[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chogyam The Translator, see p. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Work with arts and sciences===\nFrom the beginning of his time in the US, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students' already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included [[ky\u016bd\u014d]] (Japanese archery), [[calligraphy]], [[ikebana]] (flower arranging), [[Sad\u014d]] ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), [[dance]], [[theater]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[health care]], and [[psychotherapy]]. His aim was, in his own words, to bring \"art to everyday life.\" He founded the [[Nalanda Foundation]] in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\n===Death===\nTrungpa visited [[Nova Scotia]] for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established [[Gampo Abbey]], a Karma Kagy\u00fc monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984\u201385, he observed a yearlong retreat at [[Mill Village, Nova Scotia|Mill Village]] and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu's international headquarters to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nBy then he was in failing health due to the auto accident in his youth and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest,<ref>Hayward, 2008, p 367</ref> after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.\n\nIn 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, \"Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest\".<ref>Mukpo, 2006, p. 382</ref> But in a November 2008 interview, when asked \"What was he ill with? What did he die of?,\" Trungpa's doctor, Mitchell Levy, replied, \"He had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years.\"<ref>Chronicles Radio Presents. November 1st, 2008.<sup>[http://www.chronicleproject.com/chroniclesradio_dispatches/2008_11_01.html]</sup></ref> One of Trungpa's nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal [[alcoholism]] and [[cirrhosis]],<ref name=\"Butler17\"/> yet continued drinking heavily. She added, \"At the same time there was a power about him and an equanimity to his presence that was phenomenal, that I don't know how to explain.\"<ref>Zweig 1991, p. 142</ref>\n\nTrungpa is reported to have remained in a state of [[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|sam\u0101dhi]] for five days after his death, his body not immediately decaying and his heart remaining warm.<ref>Hayward, 2008, p. 371</ref> His body was packed in salt, laid in a wooden box, and conveyed to Karm\u00ea Ch\u00f6ling. A number of observers have reported that his cremation there on May 26, 1987, was accompanied by various atmospheric effects and other signs traditionally viewed as marks of enlightenment. These included the appearance of rainbows, circling eagles,<ref>Miles, 1989, pp. 526\u2013528</ref><ref>Hayward, 2008, p. 373</ref> and a cloud in the shape of an ''Ashe''.<ref>\"Collective identity and the post-charismatic fate of Shambhala International\" by Eldershaw, Lynn P., Ph.D. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2004. pg 222</ref><ref>\"Everyone who stayed long enough at Trungpa's cremation saw the rainbows.\" Stephen Butterfield, in ''The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition'' By James William Coleman; p77</ref>\n\n===Continuation of the Shambhala lineage===\nUpon Trungpa's death, the leadership of [[Vajradhatu]] was first carried on by his American disciple, appointed regent and Dharma heir, [[\u00d6sel Tendzin]] (Thomas Rich), and then by Trungpa's eldest son and Shambhala heir, [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]].\n\nThe next Trungpa [[t\u00fclku]], [[Chokyi Sengay]], was recognized in 1991 by [[Tai Situ]] Rinpoche.\n\n==Acclaim==\nMajor lineage holders of Trungpa's Tibetan Buddhist traditions and many other Buddhist teachers supported his work.\n[[File:Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]]\n\nIn 1974, Trungpa invited the 16th [[Karmapa]], head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, to come to the West and offer teachings. Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the west:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great [[siddha]] Trungmase Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso Lodr\u00f6, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders' discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the [[dharma]]. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.\n\nAccordingly, I empower Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.<ref>\"Proclamation to all Those Who Dwell Under the Sun Upholding the Tradition of the Spiritual and Temporal Orders\", The Gyalwang Karmapa, 1974, in ''Garuda IV'', 1976, pp 86\u201387, {{ISBN|0-87773-086-5}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, \"Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West.\"<ref>Midal, 2005. p. x</ref>\n\nTrungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], head of the [[Nyingma]] lineage.  In addition to numerous [[sadhana]]s and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa's death specifically naming him a [[mahasiddha]].<ref>Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/tributes/65.html Light of Blessings]</ref><ref>Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_33.html Reflections on Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche]</ref><ref>[http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html The Vajracarya Trungpa Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081428/http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}: \"The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche ... was an incarnation of the Indian Mahasiddha Dombipa\"</ref> Among other Tibetan lamas to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the Sixteenth Karmapa]], [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]] and [[Tai Situpa]].<ref>Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p274</ref>\n\nThe [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] said, \"As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The eleventh Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these.\"<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Suzuki Roshi]], founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.\n\nThat is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 381</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Gehlek Rinpoche]], who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:\n<blockquote>\nHe was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand \u2013 sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward \u2013 why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early \u2013 too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 418</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDiana Mukpo, his wife, stated:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students\u2019 critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.\n\nFrom my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2998&Itemid=0 |title = Lion's Roar}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Quote box\n |tstyle = text-align: left;\n |quote  = [Trungpa] caused more trouble, and did more good, than anyone I'll ever know.\n |source = \u2014Rick Fields, historian of Buddhism in America<ref>Fields 1992</ref><ref>Fields 1988, poem \"CTR, April 4, 1987\" in ''Fuck You Cancer and Other Poems'', p. 9.

[[Tenzin Palmo]], who met him in 1962 while he was still at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as \"a pure monk.\" But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined.<ref>''Cave in the Snow: Tendzin Palmo's quest for enlightenment'' by Vicki MacKenzie.

Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality \u2013 like Suzuki's talks \u2013 of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried.<ref name=\"Zweig141\" /> Also, according to his student [[John Steinbeck IV]] and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa's speech was unintelligible.<ref name=\"Steinbeck176_248\">Steinbeck 2001, pp. 176, 248</ref> One woman reported serving him \"big glasses of gin first thing in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Butler17\">Butler, Katy. ''Encountering the Shadow in Buddhist America'' in ''Common Boundary'' May/June 1990. pg. 17</ref>\n\nThe Steinbecks wrote ''The Other Side of Eden'', a sharply critical memoir of their lives with Trungpa in which they claim that, in addition to alcohol, he spent $40,000 a year on [[cocaine]], and used [[Seconal]] to come down from the cocaine. The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community.<ref>Steinbeck 2001, pp. 32, 41, 266</ref>. [[Joni Mitchell]] said Trungpa cured her of her cocaine addiction during a meeting with him in 1976.<ref>[https://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1317 Heart of a Prairie Girl (interview) by Mary Aikins ''Reader's Digest'' July 2005 pp146-8]</ref> She went on to refer his unorthodox characteristics in the first verse of ''Refuge of the Roads'', the last track of her album [[Hejira_(album)|''Hejira'']].<ref>[https://jonimitchell.com/music/song.cfm?id=7 Joni Mitchell official archive]</ref>\n\nAn incident that became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' among some poets and artists was the Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, held during a 3-month period of intensive meditation and study of the [[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]] vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism. The poet [[W. S. Merwin]] had arrived at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] that summer and been told by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years' worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin insisted on attending and Trungpa eventually granted his request \u2013 along with Merwin's girlfriend. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa's orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet's locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police.<ref>Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466\u2013470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23\u201325</ref> The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa's promise that \"there would be no more incidents\" and Merwin's that there would be \"no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him.\"<ref>Sanders, 1977, pp. 56, 88</ref> They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,\n<blockquote>\nMy feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start.  Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them.  I imagine, at least, that I've learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was \"supposed\" to learn) and some through him, and I'm grateful to him for those.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to become a student of his.  I wish him well.<ref>Sanders, 1977, pg. 89</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published \"The Great Naropa Poetry Wars\". The Naropa Institute later asked [[Ed Sanders]] and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.<ref>Clark (1980)</ref><ref>Marin (1979) p43-58</ref><ref>Sanders (1977)</ref><ref>Kashner (2004) p. 278ff</ref><ref>Weinberger (1986) pp 30-33</ref>\n\n[[Eliot Weinberger]] commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and [[Allen Ginsberg]] published in ''[[The Nation]]'' on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadmuseditions.com/Naropa.html|title=Cadmus Editions on Clark's publication}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Jeffery Paine]] commented on this incident that \"[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness.\"<ref>Paine (2004) pp. 106\u2013107</ref> Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as [[Robert Bly]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who began calling Trungpa a [[fascism|fascist]].<ref>Paine (2004) pg. 102</ref>\n\nTrungpa's choice of Westerner [[\u00d6sel Tendzin]] as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin's own behavior as lineage holder. While knowingly [[HIV]]-positive, Tendzin was sexually involved with students, one of whom became infected and died.<ref>Fields 1992, p. 365</ref>\n\n== Chronology ==\n1940: Born in Kham, Eastern Tibet.

Among his three main teachers were [[Jamgon Kongtrul of Sechen]], HH [[Dilgo Khyentse|Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and [[Khenpo Gangshar]].\n\nThe name ''Ch\u00f6gyam'' is a contraction of ''Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso'' ({{bo-tw|t=\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f5a\u0f7c\u0f0b|w=Chos-kyi Rgya-mtsho}}), which means \"Ocean of [[Dharma]]\". ''Trungpa'' ({{bo-tw|t=\u0f51\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f0b|w=Drung-pa}}) means \"attendant\". He was deeply trained in the Kagyu tradition and received his [[khenpo]] degree at the same time as [[Thrangu Rinpoche]]; they continued to be very close in later years. Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa was also trained in the [[Nyingma]] tradition, the oldest of the four schools, and was an adherent of the [[Rime movement|''ri-m\u00e9'']] (\"nonsectarian\") ecumenical movement within Tibetan Buddhism, which aspired to bring together and make available all the valuable teachings of the different schools, free of sectarian rivalry.\n\nAt the time of his escape from Tibet,<ref>{{cite book|title=From Lion's Jaws - Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West|publisher=Mountain|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9950293-0-9|edition=1|last1=MacLean|first1=Grant}}</ref> Trungpa was head of the Surmang group of monasteries.\n\n=== Escape from Tibet ===\nOn April 23, 1959, twenty-year-old Trungpa set out on an epic nine-month escape from his homeland.<ref>Trungpa, Ch\u00f6gyam (1966).

''Born in Tibet.''</ref> the first, preparatory stage of his escape had begun a year earlier, when he fled his home monastery after its occupation by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).<ref>''From Lion's Jaws,'' 65-69.</ref> After spending the winter in hiding, he decided definitively to escape after learning that his monastery had been destroyed.<ref>''Born in Tibet.'' 164</ref> Trungpa started with [[Akong Rinpoche]] and a small party of monastics, but as they traveled people asked to join until the party eventually numbered 300 refugees, from the elderly to mothers with babies \u2013 additions which greatly slowed and complicated the journey. Forced to abandon their animals, over half the journey was on foot as the refugees journeyed through an untracked mountain wilderness to avoid the PLA. Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months\u2019 trek they reached the Brahmaputra River. Trungpa, the monastics and about 70 refugees managed to cross the river under heavy gunfire,<ref>''Born in Tibet.''230</ref> then, eating their leather belts and bags to survive, they climbed 19,000 feet over the Himalayas before reaching the safety of Pema Ko.<ref>''Born in Tibet.''239</ref> After reaching India, on January 24, 1960 the party was flown to a refugee camp.<ref>''Born in Tibet.''248</ref><ref>''From Lion's Jaws.''270</ref>\n\nBetween 2006 and 2010, independent Canadian and French researchers using satellite imagery tracked and confirmed Trungpa\u2019s escape route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_157.html|title=Finding the Escape Route|access-date=December 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220074454/https://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_157.html|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, five survivors of the escape in Nepal, Scotland and the U.S. confirmed details of the journey and supplied their personal accounts.<ref>''From Lion's Jaws.''10-12.</ref> More recent analysis has shown the journey to be directly comparable to such sagas as Shackleton\u2019s 1914/17 Antarctic Expedition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca/place-in-history|title=Place in History|last=|first=|date= |website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}</ref> In 2016 accumulated research and survivors\u2019 stories were published in a full retelling of the story,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca|title=From Lion's Jaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}</ref> and later in the year preliminary talks began on the funding and production of a movie.\n\n===Early teachings in the West===\n{{Tibetan Buddhism sidebar}}\n\n[[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]] was known for seeing the future and made plans accordingly. In 1954, shortly after giving the monastic vows, Karmapa turned to Chogyam Trungp Rinpoche and said, \"In the future you will bring Dharma to the West.\" At the time, his students wondered what in the world could he be talking about. <ref>Bausch, Gerd, Radiant Compassion, The Life of the 16th Gyalway Karmapa, Volume 1, 2018 pp. 164-165</ref>\n\nIn exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. In collaboration with Freda Bedi, who had initiated the project,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Accomplishments of Freda Bedi, in Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor.

In 1970, after a break with Akong, Trungpa moved to the United States at the invitation of several students.\n\nShortly after his move to Scotland, a variety of experiences, including a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to give up his monastic vows and work as a lay teacher.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Born in Tibet, 1977 edition, Epilogue</ref> He made that decision principally to mitigate students' becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.\n\nUpon moving to the United States in 1970, Trungpa traveled throughout North America, gaining renown for his ability to present the essence of the highest Buddhist teachings in a form readily understandable to Western students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.<ref>last paragraph is exact quote from http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php</ref>\n\n===Introduction of the Vajrayana===\nTrungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce the esoteric practice of the [[Vajrayana]] to the West. According to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, \"The one who mainly spread the Vajrayana in the West was Trungpa Rinpoche.\"<ref>Interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche; 17 September 2003 [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315125527/http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html |date=2010-03-15 }}, after [http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php]</ref> In contrast to its traditional presentation in Tibet, where the esoteric practices are largely the domain of the monastic sangha, in the US Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana to the lay sangha.<ref>Dead but not lost: grief narratives in religious traditions By Robert Goss, Dennis Klass; p74</ref>\n\nThe presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa's former student Stephen Butterfield, \"Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies\".<ref>Butterfield 11</ref> Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the esoteric path.\n\nButterfield noted \"disquieting resemblances\" to cults, and \"to be part of Trungpa's inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did.\" But Butterfield also notes that \"This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism,\"<ref>Butterfield 12, 100</ref> and acknowledges that Trungpa's organization is anything but a cult: \"a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled.\"<ref>Butterfield 239</ref>\n\n===Meditation and education centers===\n[[File:Karme ch\u00f6ling purkong.jpg|thumb|The purkhang at [[Karm\u00ea Ch\u00f6ling]]|349x349px]]\nIn 1973, Trungpa established [[Vajradhatu]], encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as [[Shambhala International|Shambhala Meditation Centers]]. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes]], Colorado, [[Karm\u00ea Ch\u00f6ling]] in [[Barnet, Vermont|Barnet]], Vermont and [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nIn 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became [[Naropa University]], in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado.  Naropa was the first accredited [[Buddhist universities in the United States and Canada|Buddhist university]] in North America. Trungpa hired [[Allen Ginsberg]] to teach [[poetry]] and [[William Burroughs]] to teach [[literature]].\n\nTrungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were [[Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Diane di Prima]], [[Peter Lieberson]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles]], [[David Nichtern]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[David Deida]], [[Francisco Varela]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], who portrayed Trungpa in the song \"Refuge of the Roads\" on her 1976 album [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|title=What Kind of Buddhist was Steve Jobs, Really?|accessdate=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508054008/http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|archive-date=2017-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s [[Marianne Faithfull]] taught songwriting workshops.\nLesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] (n\u00e9 Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (n\u00e9 P. Howard Useche), [[Ezequiel Hernandez]] Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka [[Dorje Khandro]]), Francisco Salas Roche, and [[Francesca Fremantle]]. [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] promulgated Trungpa's teachings from a primarily [[Nyingma]] rather than Kagy\u00fc point of view at the Longchen Foundation.<ref>[http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html Longchen Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128075242/http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html |date=2012-01-28 }}</ref><ref>Rigdzin Shikpo 2007</ref>\n\n===Shambhala vision===\n\nIn 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the [[Shambhala Training]],<ref>Midal 2001, pp 233\u2013247</ref><ref>Trungpa 2004, Introduction to Volume 8</ref> inspired by his vision (see [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. Trungpa had actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.<ref>Midal 2005, pp 363\u2013364</ref>\n\nIn his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one's [[basic goodness]] and confidence. It is presented as a path that \"brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life.\" Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as ''sakyong'' (Tib. earth protector) with his wife as queen-consort or ''sakyong wangmo.''\n\nShambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'', provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his [[intention]] to propagate the [[Kings of Shambhala|kingdom of Shambala]] that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.<ref>[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chogyam The Translator, see p. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Work with arts and sciences===\nFrom the beginning of his time in the US, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students' already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included [[ky\u016bd\u014d]] (Japanese archery), [[calligraphy]], [[ikebana]] (flower arranging), [[Sad\u014d]] ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), [[dance]], [[theater]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[health care]], and [[psychotherapy]]. His aim was, in his own words, to bring \"art to everyday life.\" He founded the [[Nalanda Foundation]] in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\n===Death===\nTrungpa visited [[Nova Scotia]] for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established [[Gampo Abbey]], a Karma Kagy\u00fc monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984\u201385, he observed a yearlong retreat at [[Mill Village, Nova Scotia|Mill Village]] and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu's international headquarters to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nBy then he was in failing health due to the auto accident in his youth and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest,<ref>Hayward, 2008, p 367</ref> after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.\n\nIn 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, \"Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest\".<ref>Mukpo, 2006, p. 382</ref> But in a November 2008 interview, when asked \"What was he ill with? What did he die of?,\" Trungpa's doctor, Mitchell Levy, replied, \"He had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years.\"<ref>Chronicles Radio Presents. November 1st, 2008.<sup>[http://www.chronicleproject.com/chroniclesradio_dispatches/2008_11_01.html]</sup></ref> One of Trungpa's nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal [[alcoholism]] and [[cirrhosis]],<ref name=\"Butler17\"/> yet continued drinking heavily.

Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the west:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great [[siddha]] Trungmase Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso Lodr\u00f6, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders' discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the [[dharma]]. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.\n\nAccordingly, I empower Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.<ref>\"Proclamation to all Those Who Dwell Under the Sun Upholding the Tradition of the Spiritual and Temporal Orders\", The Gyalwang Karmapa, 1974, in ''Garuda IV'', 1976, pp 86\u201387, {{ISBN|0-87773-086-5}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, \"Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West.\"<ref>Midal, 2005. p. x</ref>\n\nTrungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], head of the [[Nyingma]] lineage.  In addition to numerous [[sadhana]]s and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa's death specifically naming him a [[mahasiddha]].<ref>Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/tributes/65.html Light of Blessings]</ref><ref>Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_33.html Reflections on Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche]</ref><ref>[http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html The Vajracarya Trungpa Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081428/http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}: \"The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche ... was an incarnation of the Indian Mahasiddha Dombipa\"</ref> Among other Tibetan lamas to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the Sixteenth Karmapa]], [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]] and [[Tai Situpa]].<ref>Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p274</ref>\n\nThe [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] said, \"As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The eleventh Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these.\"<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Suzuki Roshi]], founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.\n\nThat is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 381</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Gehlek Rinpoche]], who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:\n<blockquote>\nHe was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand \u2013 sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward \u2013 why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early \u2013 too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.<ref>Midal, 2005. p. 418</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDiana Mukpo, his wife, stated:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students\u2019 critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.\n\nFrom my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2998&Itemid=0 |title = Lion's Roar}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Quote box\n |tstyle = text-align: left;\n |quote  = [Trungpa] caused more trouble, and did more good, than anyone I'll ever know.\n |source = \u2014Rick Fields, historian of Buddhism in America<ref>Fields 1992</ref><ref>Fields 1988, poem \"CTR, April 4, 1987\" in ''Fuck You Cancer and Other Poems'', p. 9.

[[Tenzin Palmo]], who met him in 1962 while he was still at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as \"a pure monk.\" But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined.<ref>''Cave in the Snow: Tendzin Palmo's quest for enlightenment'' by Vicki MacKenzie.

David Chadwick recounts:<ref>Chadwick 1999, p. 374</ref>\n<blockquote>\nSuzuki [Roshi] asked Trungpa to give a talk to the students in the [[zendo]] the next night. Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality \u2013 like Suzuki's talks \u2013 of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried.<ref name=\"Zweig141\" /> Also, according to his student [[John Steinbeck IV]] and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa's speech was unintelligible.<ref name=\"Steinbeck176_248\">Steinbeck 2001, pp. 176, 248</ref> One woman reported serving him \"big glasses of gin first thing in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Butler17\">Butler, Katy.

The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community.<ref>Steinbeck 2001, pp. 32, 41, 266</ref>.

The poet [[W. S. Merwin]] had arrived at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] that summer and been told by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years' worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin insisted on attending and Trungpa eventually granted his request \u2013 along with Merwin's girlfriend. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa's orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet's locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police.<ref>Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466\u2013470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23\u201325</ref> The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa's promise that \"there would be no more incidents\" and Merwin's that there would be \"no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him.\"<ref>Sanders, 1977, pp. 56, 88</ref> They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,\n<blockquote>\nMy feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start.  Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them.  I imagine, at least, that I've learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was \"supposed\" to learn) and some through him, and I'm grateful to him for those.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to become a student of his.  I wish him well.<ref>Sanders, 1977, pg. 89</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published \"The Great Naropa Poetry Wars\". The Naropa Institute later asked [[Ed Sanders]] and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.<ref>Clark (1980)</ref><ref>Marin (1979) p43-58</ref><ref>Sanders (1977)</ref><ref>Kashner (2004) p. 278ff</ref><ref>Weinberger (1986) pp 30-33</ref>\n\n[[Eliot Weinberger]] commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and [[Allen Ginsberg]] published in ''[[The Nation]]'' on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadmuseditions.com/Naropa.html|title=Cadmus Editions on Clark's publication}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Jeffery Paine]] commented on this incident that \"[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness.\"<ref>Paine (2004) pp. 106\u2013107</ref> Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as [[Robert Bly]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who began calling Trungpa a [[fascism|fascist]].<ref>Paine (2004) pg. 102</ref>\n\nTrungpa's choice of Westerner [[\u00d6sel Tendzin]] as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin's own behavior as lineage holder.
