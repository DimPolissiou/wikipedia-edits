The film is a new interpretation of the ''Conan'' myth, and is not related to the films featuring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. It stars [[Jason Momoa]] in the title role, alongside [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Ron Perlman]], and [[Bob Sapp]] with [[Marcus Nispel]] directing. [[Morgan Freeman]] narrates the film.\n\nThe film had spent several years in development at [[Warner Bros.]], before the rights were shifted to Nu Image/Millennium Films in 2007, with a clause wishing for immediate start on production. [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and [[Sony Pictures]] entered negotiations for distribution, with the film seeing many directors, prominently [[Brett Ratner]], before settling on Nispel in 2009, and subsequently bringing together a cast and crew. Filming began on March 15, 2010, and concluded June 5, 2010. The film was first released on August 17, 2011, in four countries: [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Iceland]], and the [[Philippines]]<ref>[http://www.syfyuniversal.fr/content/conan-le-barbare-2011-bande-annonce ''Conan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s French and Belgian releases as announced on ''Syfyuniversal.fr'', a French science fiction & fantasy online channel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728190621/http://www.syfyuniversal.fr/content/conan-le-barbare-2011-bande-annonce |date=July 28, 2011 }}</ref><ref>''Illimit\u00e9, le magazine des cin\u00e9mas UGC'', #202/July\u2013August 2011, page 17, ISSN 1165-4368</ref> prior to the North American release on August 19.

This one is currently 696 words. -->\nConan is the son of Corin, a barbarian chieftan. Conan is a skilled but violent warrior, whom his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.\n\nYears later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners.\n\nZym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.\n\nZym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, who kill several of Conan's men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.\n\nConan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and cuts off Marique's hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.\n\nConan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife.\n\nConan and Tamara escape, and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they will meet again. He returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]\n** [[Leo Howard]] as young Conan\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Tamara, a beautiful and studious novice of a monastery who is actually of a bloodline of [[Acheron Empire|Acheronian necromancers]].\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Khalar Zym, a ruthless empire-building warlord.

It stars [[Jason Momoa]] in the title role, alongside [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Ron Perlman]], and [[Bob Sapp]] with [[Marcus Nispel]] directing.

[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and [[Sony Pictures]] entered negotiations for distribution, with the film seeing many directors, prominently [[Brett Ratner]], before settling on Nispel in 2009, and subsequently bringing together a cast and crew.

This one is currently 696 words. -->\nConan is the son of Corin, a barbarian chieftan. Conan is a skilled but violent warrior, whom his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.\n\nYears later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners.\n\nZym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.\n\nZym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, who kill several of Conan's men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.\n\nConan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and cuts off Marique's hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.\n\nConan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife.\n\nConan and Tamara escape, and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they will meet again. He returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]\n** [[Leo Howard]] as young Conan\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Tamara, a beautiful and studious novice of a monastery who is actually of a bloodline of [[Acheron Empire|Acheronian necromancers]].\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Khalar Zym, a ruthless empire-building warlord.

The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open. The traditional three-key navigation system used since [[Android Honeycomb|Android \"Honeycomb\"]] remains supported as an option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791457/google-android-q-back-gesture-controversy-app-drawer-navigation|title=Android Q's back gesture controversy, explained|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=August 8, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-navigation-gestures-mandatory/|title=[Update: OEM Gestures Allowed] Google's new navigation gestures in Android Q will be mandatory for all devices|date=May 9, 2019|website=xda-developers|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPer Google certification requirements, OEMs are required to support Android 10's default gestures and three-key navigation.

He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C.

Col. [[Felix L. Sparks]], a battalion commander of the 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division, Seventh United States Army, wrote about the incident. Sparks watched as about 50 German prisoners captured by the 157th Infantry Regiment were confined in an area that had been used for storing coal. The area was partially enclosed by an L-shaped masonry wall about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and next to a hospital. The German POWs were watched over by a machine gun team from Company I. He left those men behind to head towards the center of the camp where there were SS who had not yet surrendered; he had only gone a short distance when he heard a soldier yell, \"They're trying to get away!\" and then machine-gun fire coming from the area he had just left. He ran back and kicked a 19-year-old soldier nicknamed \"Birdeye\" who was manning the machine gun and who had killed about 12 of the prisoners and wounded several more.<ref name=humanities-international>{{cite news |title=DACHAU CONCENTRATION CAMP \u2013 LIBERATION |url=http://www.humanitas-international.org/archive/dachau-liberation |date=2002 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |first=R.H. |last=Perez |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010045411/http://www.humanitas-international.org/archive/dachau-liberation/ |archivedate=10 October 2013 }}</ref> The gunner, who was crying hysterically, said that the prisoners had tried to escape.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The total number of German guards killed at Dachau during that day most certainly did not exceed fifty, with thirty probably being a more accurate figure. The regimental records for that date indicate that over a thousand German prisoners were brought to the regimental collecting point.

Joseph Whitaker, the account given by Howard Buechner (then a first lieutenant in the United States Army and medical officer with the 3rd Battalion of the 157th Infantry), to Whitaker on 5 May 1945 did not contradict the Sparks account. Buechner's sworn testimony was that around 16:00 he arrived in the yard where the German soldiers had been shot, and that he \"saw 15 or 16 dead and wounded German soldiers lying along the wall\". He noted that some of the wounded soldiers were still moving, but he did not examine any of them. He answered \"Yes, sir\" when asked if he was the surgeon of the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry, at that time, and did not know if any medical attention was called for the wounded.<ref name=\"abraham.cs.uml.edu\">\"...investigation of alleged mistreatment of German guards at the Concentration Camp at Dachau, Germany...\"  {{cite web |url=http://abraham.cs.uml.edu/secretwar/GlobeSecretHistory/index5_transcript_46.shtml |title= Globe Secret History Index No.5 |accessdate=2013-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918030939/http://abraham.cs.uml.edu/secretwar/GlobeSecretHistory/index5_transcript_46.shtml |archivedate=2013-09-18 }} retrieved 11.6.2014</ref><ref name=Humanitas>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitas-international.org/archive/dachau-liberation/ |title=Dachau Concentration Camp Liberation (A Documentary) |author=R.H.

Anywhere from a few to 25 or 50 more were killed by inmates. Zarusky's research makes use of the detailed interrogation records contained in Whitaker's official May 1945 investigation report, which became accessible in 1992, as well as a collection of documents compiled by General Henning Linden's son.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Zarusky |first= J\u00fcrgen |chapter= 'That is not the American Way of Fighting:' The Shooting of Captured SS-Men During the Liberation of Dachau |editor1= Wolfgang Benz |editor2= Barbara Distel |title= Dachau and the Nazi Terror 1933\u20131945 |volume= 2, Studies and Reports |publisher= Verlag Dachauer Hefte |location= Dachau |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dachaunaziterror0000unse/page/133 133\u2013160] |isbn= 978-3-9808587-1-7 |url= https://archive.org/details/dachaunaziterror0000unse/page/133 }} [http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/dachau/archive/ZaruskyDachauLiberationMassacre2002excerpt.pdf Excerpt online]</ref>\n\nThe Dachau liberation reprisals were documented among others by U.S. Army photographers [[Paul Richard Averitt|Paul Averitt]], [[George Gaberlavage]], [[Sidney Rachlin]] and [[Ed Royce, Sr.]]\n\n==Killings by the inmates==\nWalenty Lenarczyk, a prisoner at Dachau, stated that following the camp's liberation \"prisoners swarmed over the wire and grabbed the Americans and lifted them to their shoulders... other prisoners caught the SS men... The first SS man elbowed one or two prisoners out of his way, but the courage of the prisoners mounted, they knocked them down and nobody could see whether they were stomped or what, but they were killed.\"<ref name=AP/> Elsewhere in the camp SS men, Kapos and informers were beaten badly with fists, sticks and shovels. There was at least one incident where US soldiers turned away from two prisoners beating a German guard to death with a shovel, and Lt. Bill Walsh witnessed one such beating.<ref>The Liberator : One World War II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey from the Beaches of Sicily to the Gates of Dachau. Alex Kershaw. 2012. Crown.

Joseph Whitaker, the Seventh Army's Assistant Inspector General, was subsequently ordered to investigate after witnesses came forward testifying about the killings. He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C. Pruitt then climbed into the box car and performed a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' on the wounded men.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nAfter he had entered the camp, Walsh, along with Lt. Jack Bushyhead, the executive officer of Company \"I\", organized the segregation of POWs into those who were members of the Wehrmacht and those who were in the SS. The SS were marched into a separate enclosure and were shot by members of \"I\" Company with several different types of weapons.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nThe investigation resulted in the U.S. military considering [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against those involved, including the battalion commander [[Felix L. Sparks|Lt. Col. Felix Sparks]], while Lt. Howard Buechner was cited in the report for dereliction of duty for not giving the wounded SS men in the coal yard medical aid.<ref name=Humanitas/> However, [[General (United States)|Gen.]] [[George S. Patton]], the recently appointed military governor of Bavaria, chose to dismiss the charges. Therefore, the witnesses to the killings were never cross-examined in court.<ref name=AP/>\n\nCol. Charles L. Decker, an acting deputy judge advocate, concluded in late 1945 that, while there had probably been a violation of international law, \"in the light of the conditions which greeted the eyes of the first combat troops, it is not believed that justice or equity demand that the difficult and perhaps impossible task of fixing individual responsibility now be undertaken\".<ref>The Liberator: One World War II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey from the Beaches of Sicily to the Gates of Dachau.
