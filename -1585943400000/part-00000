Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs.

Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia.

These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]].

The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.\n\nA dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. Purebred dog breeders of today \"have inherited a breeding paradigm that is, at the very least, a bit anachronistic in light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a pretty blatant misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable.\"<ref name=\"Budiansky\">{{Cite book | last =Budiansky\" | first =Stephen | publication-date =2000 | title =The Truth About Dogs; an Inquiry into the Ancestry, Social Conventions, Mental Habits, and Moral Fiber of Canis familiaris | location =New York, U.S.A. | place = | publisher =Viking Penguin | page =[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 35] | isbn =978-0-670-89272-3 | year =2000 | url =https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 }}</ref> The American Kennel Club allows [[mixed-breed dog]]s to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL).<ref name=\"AKC-Mixed\">{{cite web | title=Get Started - Register Your Mixed Breed Dog With AKC Canine Partners | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-07-28 | url=https://www.akc.org/register/information/canine-partners/get-started/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> California Assembly Act AB 1634 was a bill introduced in 2007 that would require all non-working dogs of mixed breed over the age of 6 months to be neutered or spayed.<ref name=\"ab1634\">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165548/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> The bill was morally controversial, leading the American Kennel Club to fight the bill.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222300/http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian department of agriculture has strict standards for the documenting of what it calls \"evolving breeds\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-11.2/FullText.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726205721/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.2/FullText.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2012 |title=Animal Pedigree Act 1985 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |work=Department of Justice, Canada }}</ref>\n\n====Breed standards====\nThe [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/about/glossary.cfm American Kennel Club Glossary]</ref> Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called ''[[Fault (dog)|faults]]'').

Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. Form was given a more prominent role than function.<ref name=\"Worboys 2019\">{{cite web | last=Worboys | first=Michael | title=The history of dog breeds | website=The Week | date=2019-04-13 | url=https://theweek.com/articles/832600/history-dog-breeds | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"KC-Standard\">{{cite web | title=About Breed Standards | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/dog-showing/breed-standards/about-breed-standards/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs.<ref name=\"KC-Standard\"/> Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning.

Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia. Mastiff-type dogs were kept for guarding and hunting, and short-legged dogs were also bred.<ref>Clutton-Brock, J., 1995.

Strong [[artificial selection]] has developed around 450 globally recognized breeds. These breeds possess distinct [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] traits including body size, skull shape, tail [[phenotype]], fur colour and fur type. They also possess behavioral traits including herding, guarding, and hunting, in addition to personality traits such as aggression, boldness, or hypersocial behavior. Most of these breeds were developed within the last 200 years using only small numbers of [[Founder effect|founders]]. As a result, the large phenotypic variation across dog breeds can be studied through the analysis with only a small number of [[genetic markers]].<ref name=Ostrander2019/>\n\n{{cladogram\n|caption=[[Cladogram]] of nine breeds that are genetically divergent from others<ref name=parker2004/>|\n|cladogram=\n{{clade|style=font-size:75%; line-height:75%;width:300px;\n  |1=[[Wolf]]\n  |2={{clade\n       |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Shar Pei]]\n            |2={{clade\n                 |1=[[Shiba Inu]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Chow Chow]]\n                     |2=[[Akita Inu]]\n                   }}\n               }}\n          }}\n       |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Basenji]]\n            |2={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                     |1=[[Siberian Husky]]\n                     |2=[[Alaskan Malamute]]\n                   }}\n                |2={{clade\n                     |1={{clade\n                          |1=[[Afghan Hound]]\n                          |2=[[Saluki]]\n                        }}\n                     |2=other breeds in the study\n                   }}\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n}}\n\n===Ancient dog breeds===\n\"Ancient breed\" is a term formerly, but no longer, used for a particular group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club,<ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/>.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Kennel Club|title=Dog breed groups|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/}}</ref> These breeds were referred to as \"ancient\", as opposed to modern, breeds because historically it was believed that they had origins dating back more than 500 years. \n\nIn 2004, a study looked at the [[Microsatellite#Analysis of microsatellites|microsatellite]]s of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their [[genotype]], indicating that breeding barriers (pure-bred breeding) has led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a [[phylogenetic tree]] which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as \"ancient breeds\", as opposed to the modern breeds. The study found that the [[Pharaoh Hound]] and [[Ibizan Hound]] were not as old as believed but had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the [[Norwegian Elkhound]] grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.<ref name=parker2004/>\n\nThe dog which accompanied the ancestors of Native Americans from Siberia is extinct.<ref name=\"Science7618\">{{cite journal |author1=M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Leathlobhair and about 50 others |title=The evolutionary history of dogs in the Americas |journal=Science |date=July 6, 2018 |volume=361 |issue=6397 |pages=81\u201385 |doi=10.1126/science.aao4776 |pmid=29976825 }}</ref><ref name=\"UI7518\">{{cite web |author1=Diana Yates |title=First dogs in the Americas arrived from Siberia, disappeared after European contact |url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/668925 |website=news.illinois.edu |publisher=University of Illinois |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |date=July 5, 2018 |quote=These dogs persisted for thousands of years in the Americas, but almost completely vanished after European contact, the researchers found.}}</ref>\n\n===Dog types===\n[[File:Five different types of dogs, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029217.jpg|thumb|\"Five different types of dogs\", c. 1547.]]\n\n{{further|Dog type}}\n\n[[Dog types]] are broad categories of dogs based on form, function or style of work, lineage, or appearance. In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. \n\nThe spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830\u20131900).<ref name=\"Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World\"/><ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/> In 2010, a study looked at 48,000&nbsp;[[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 912&nbsp;dogs representing 85&nbsp;breeds.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\">{{cite journal |first=Bridgett |last=vonHoldt |date=2010-03-17 |title=Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature08837 |pmid=20237475 |volume=464 |issue=7290 |pages=898\u2013902 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..898V |pmc=3494089 |last2=Lohmueller |first2=Kirk E. |last3=Han |first3=Eunjung |last4=Parker |first4=Heidi G. |last5=Quignon |first5=Pascale |last6=Degenhardt |first6=Jeremiah D. |last7=Boyko |first7=Adam R. |last8=Earl |first8=Dent A. |last9=Auton |first9=Adam |last10=Reynolds |first10=Andy |last11=Bryc |first11=Kasia |last12=Brisbin |first12=Abra |last13=Knowles |first13=James C. |last14=Mosher |first14=Dana S. |last15=Spady |first15=Tyrone C. |last16=Elkahloun |first16=Abdel |last17=Geffen |first17=Eli |last18=Pilot |first18=Malgorzata |last19=Jedrzejewski |first19=Wlodzimierz |last20=Greco |first20=Claudia |last21=Randi |first21=Ettore |last22=Bannasch |first22=Danika |last23=Wilton |first23=Alan |last24=Shearman |first24=Jeremy |last25=Musiani |first25=Marco |last26=Cargill |first26=Michelle |last27=Jones |first27=Paul G. |last28=Qian |first28=Zuwei |last29=Huang |first29=Wei |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to [[phenotype]] or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]]. The study referred to these 16 as [[Basal (phylogenetics)|Basal]] breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be \"ancient breeds\".<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

For instance, the [[Feist (dog)|feist]] is a hunting dog raised in the [[Southern United States]] for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other [[dog type]]s and breeds. However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.\n\nA dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed.

Light produces immaterial and substantial lights, including immaterial intellects ([[angel]]s), human and animal souls, and even 'dusky substances', such as bodies.<ref>''Philosophy of Illumination'' 77.1&ndash;78.9</ref>\n\nSuhrawardi's metaphysics is based on two principles.

The second principle is Aristotle's principle that an [[actual infinity]] is impossible.<ref>''Philosophy of Illumination'' 87.1&ndash;89.8</ref>\n\nNone of Suhrawardi's works were translated into Latin, and so he remained unknown in the [[Latin West]], although his work continued to be studied in the Islamic East.<ref>Marcotte, Roxanne, \"Suhrawardi\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition), Edward N.

Although Suhravardi was first a pioneer of Peripatetic philosophy, he later became a Platonist following a mystical experience. He is also counted as one who revived the ancient wisdom in Persia by his philosophy of illumination. His followers, such as Shahrzouri and [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] tried to continue the way of their teacher. Suhrewardi makes a distinction between two approaches in the philosophy of illumination: one approach is discursive and another is intuitive.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Walbridge |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |chapter=Suhraward\u012b and Illuminationism |pp=201\u2013223 |date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511999864 | editor-first1=Peter| editor-first2=Richard C.| editor-last1=Adamson| editor-last2=Taylor}} </ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Light (theology)]]\n* [[Mulla Sadra]]\n* [[Enlightenment (spiritual)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Suhrawardi and the School of Illumination'' by Mehdi Amin Razavi\n* ''Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia'' by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]]\n\n==External links==\n* \"\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n* \n\n{{philosophy topics|schools}}\n\n[[Category:Persian philosophy]]\n[[Category:History of logic]]\n[[Category:Theories of deduction]]\n[[Category:Iranian philosophy]]\n[[fr:Philosophie illuminative]]\n", "name_user": "71.120.147.82", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminationism"}

Their eastern limits were around [http://maps.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=240336&wnb=65729501&cmd=sp&c=1&x=142.27289&y=-26.51232&mpsec=0 Mount Howitt] and [http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=212468&cmd=sp Kyabra Creek]. Their northwesterly frontiers lay in proximity of [[Lake Yamma Yamma]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=178}} Neighbouring tribes were the [[Kuungkari]], [[Bidia]] and [[Kulumali]].\n\n==History of contact==\nWhite settlers began to occupy Kungadutji lands between 1874 and 1878, together with those of the neighbouring Kuungkari and Bidia. The combined population of these three groups in the period of first contacts was estimated to be around 1,200 people. Within a decade, by 1883, women greatly outnumbered the male population, large numbers of the latter being shot down during the process of occupying their country. The women contracted [[syphilis]] from the newcomers, whose effects further ravaged the tribes.{{sfn|Heagney|1886|pp=375\u2013376}}{{efn|Since the advent of the Whites, few children are reared\u2014the rifle, syphilis, and debauchery having, as usual, commenced the work of extermination.{{sfn|Heagney|1886|p=376}}}}\n\n==Alternative names==\n* ''Kungaditji.''\n* ''Kungarditchi.''{{sfn|Heagney|1886|p=374}}\n* ''Kunatatchee.''{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=178}}\n\n==Some words==\n* ''dethee''/''conatha'' (wild dog)\n* ''copunya''/''moonaroo.''

The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}} At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to put both cyclists in first place,{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=9}} to keep both sponsors satisfied.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nIn the third stage, the Tour returned to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs officers and the delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} During the stage in the Alps, \u00c9mile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} In the seventh stage, [[Marcel Cadolle]], at that time in second place,<ref>{{cite web|title=5\u00e8me Tour de France 1907 \u2013 6\u00e8me \u00e9tape |url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114635/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |archivedate=3 May 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2009 }}</ref> fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\n[[File:Lucien Mazan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucien Petit-Breton]], the winner of the 1907 Tour de France|alt=A man on a bicycle, riding on an outdoor velodrome.]]During the ninth stage, when Georget was leading the race, he broke the frame of his bicycle{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} at a checkpoint.

The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}} At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to put both cyclists in first place,{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=9}} to keep both sponsors satisfied.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nIn the third stage, the Tour returned to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs officers and the delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} During the stage in the Alps, \u00c9mile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} In the seventh stage, [[Marcel Cadolle]], at that time in second place,<ref>{{cite web|title=5\u00e8me Tour de France 1907 \u2013 6\u00e8me \u00e9tape |url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114635/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |archivedate=3 May 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2009 }}</ref> fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\n[[File:Lucien Mazan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucien Petit-Breton]], the winner of the 1907 Tour de France|alt=A man on a bicycle, riding on an outdoor velodrome.]]During the ninth stage, when Georget was leading the race, he broke the frame of his bicycle{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} at a checkpoint.
