It was agreed that in exchange for training staff and delegates, the Institute would receive intellectual resources and diplomatic expertise (guest lecturers, etc.) from the aforementioned organisations. According to its statutes, the Graduate Institute was \"an institution intended to provide students of all nations the means of undertaking and pursuing international studies, most notably of a historic, judicial, economic, political and social nature.\"\n\nThe institute managed to attract a number of eminent faculty and lecturers, particularly from countries mired in oppressive Nazi regimes, e.g., {{interlanguage link|Hans Wehberg|de}} and [[Georges Scelle]] for law, Maurice Bourquin for diplomatic history, and the rising young Swiss jurist, [[Paul Guggenheim]]. Indeed, it is said that [[William Rappard]] had observed, ironically, that the two men to whom the Institute owed its greatest debt were [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Subsequently, more noted scholars would join the Institute's faculty. [[Hans Kelsen]], the well-known theorist and philosopher of law, [[Guglielmo Ferrero]], Italian historian, and [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt|Carl Burckhardt]], scholar and diplomat all called the Graduate Institute home. Other arrivals, similarly seeking refuge from dictatorships, included the eminent free market economy historian, [[Ludwig von Mises]], and another economist, [[Wilhelm Ropke]], who greatly influenced German postwar liberal economic policy as well as the development of the theory of a social market system.<ref name=\"The European Review\">{{cite web |url= http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node/272|title= Still Generating the Geneve Internationale|volume= 5 |issue= 2|publisher= The European Review|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of years, the Institute had developed a system whereby ''cours temporaires'' were given by prominent intellectuals on a week, semester, or yearlong basis. These cours temporaires were the intellectual showcase of the Institute, attracting such names as [[Raymond Aron]], [[Ren\u00e9 Cassin]], [[Luigi Einaudi]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[G. P. Gooch]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Hersch Lauterpacht]], [[Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair|Lord McNair]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]],<ref name=\"Myrdal\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400594/Gunnar-Myrdal|title= Gunnar Myrdal|year= 2012|work= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Academic Edition|publisher= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Harold Nicolson]], [[Philip Noel Baker]], [[Pierre Renouvin]], [[Lionel Robbins]], {{interlanguage link|Jean de Salis|fr|Jean-Rodolphe de Salis}}, Count [[Carlo Sforza]], [[Jacob Viner]], and Martin Wight.\n[[File:Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva (nameplate).jpg|thumb|right|200px|IHEID's later logo at Villa Barton's main gate.]]\nAnother cours temporaire professor, Montagu Burton Professor of International Relations at Oxford University, Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], left a particularly lasting mark on the Institute. As early as 1924, while serving on the staff of the International Council for intellectual Cooperation in Paris, Zimmern began organizing international affairs summer schools under the auspices of the [[University of Geneva]], 'Zimmern schools', as they became known. The initiative operated in parallel with the early planning for the launch of the Graduate Institute and the experience acquired by the former helped to shape the latter.<ref name=\"The European Review\" />\n\nDespite its small size, (before the 1980s the faculty never exceeded 25 members), the Institute boasts four faculty members who have received Nobel Prizes for economics \u2013 [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Maurice Allais]], and [[Robert Mundell]]. Three alumni have been Nobel laureates.\n\nFor a period of almost thirty years (1927\u20131954) the school was funded predominantly through the support of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since then the canton of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Council bear most of the costs associated with the Institute. This transfer of financial responsibility coincided with the 1955 arrival of William Rappard's successor as director of the institute, Lausanne historian [[Jacques Freymond]]. Freymond inaugurated a period of great expansion, increasing the range of subjects taught and the number of both students and faculty, a process that continued well after his retirement in 1978. Under Freymond's tenure, the Graduate Institute hosted many international colloquia that discussed preconditions for east-west negotiations, relations with China and its rising influence in world affairs, European integration, techniques and results of politico-socioeconomic forecasting (the famous early [[Club of Rome]] reports, and the Futuribles project led by [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]), the causes and possible antidotes to terrorism, [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] Conference concerns and much more.

It was agreed that in exchange for training staff and delegates, the Institute would receive intellectual resources and diplomatic expertise (guest lecturers, etc.) from the aforementioned organisations. According to its statutes, the Graduate Institute was \"an institution intended to provide students of all nations the means of undertaking and pursuing international studies, most notably of a historic, judicial, economic, political and social nature.\"\n\nThe institute managed to attract a number of eminent faculty and lecturers, particularly from countries mired in oppressive Nazi regimes, e.g., {{interlanguage link|Hans Wehberg|de}} and [[Georges Scelle]] for law, Maurice Bourquin for diplomatic history, and the rising young Swiss jurist, [[Paul Guggenheim]]. Indeed, it is said that [[William Rappard]] had observed, ironically, that the two men to whom the Institute owed its greatest debt were [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Subsequently, more noted scholars would join the Institute's faculty. [[Hans Kelsen]], the well-known theorist and philosopher of law, [[Guglielmo Ferrero]], Italian historian, and [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt|Carl Burckhardt]], scholar and diplomat all called the Graduate Institute home. Other arrivals, similarly seeking refuge from dictatorships, included the eminent free market economy historian, [[Ludwig von Mises]], and another economist, [[Wilhelm Ropke]], who greatly influenced German postwar liberal economic policy as well as the development of the theory of a social market system.<ref name=\"The European Review\">{{cite web |url= http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node/272|title= Still Generating the Geneve Internationale|volume= 5 |issue= 2|publisher= The European Review|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of years, the Institute had developed a system whereby ''cours temporaires'' were given by prominent intellectuals on a week, semester, or yearlong basis.

As early as 1924, while serving on the staff of the International Council for intellectual Cooperation in Paris, Zimmern began organizing international affairs summer schools under the auspices of the [[University of Geneva]], 'Zimmern schools', as they became known. The initiative operated in parallel with the early planning for the launch of the Graduate Institute and the experience acquired by the former helped to shape the latter.<ref name=\"The European Review\" />\n\nDespite its small size, (before the 1980s the faculty never exceeded 25 members), the Institute boasts four faculty members who have received Nobel Prizes for economics \u2013 [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Maurice Allais]], and [[Robert Mundell]]. Three alumni have been Nobel laureates.\n\nFor a period of almost thirty years (1927\u20131954) the school was funded predominantly through the support of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since then the canton of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Council bear most of the costs associated with the Institute. This transfer of financial responsibility coincided with the 1955 arrival of William Rappard's successor as director of the institute, Lausanne historian [[Jacques Freymond]]. Freymond inaugurated a period of great expansion, increasing the range of subjects taught and the number of both students and faculty, a process that continued well after his retirement in 1978. Under Freymond's tenure, the Graduate Institute hosted many international colloquia that discussed preconditions for east-west negotiations, relations with China and its rising influence in world affairs, European integration, techniques and results of politico-socioeconomic forecasting (the famous early [[Club of Rome]] reports, and the Futuribles project led by [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]), the causes and possible antidotes to terrorism, [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] Conference concerns and much more. Freymond's term also saw many landmark publications, including the Treatise on international law by Professor Paul Guggenheim and the six-volume compilation of historical documents relating to the [[Communist International]].<ref name=\"The European Review\" />\n\nThe parallel history of the Graduate Institute of Development Studies (French: Institut universitaire d\u2019\u00e9tudes du d\u00e9veloppement, IUED) also involves Freymond, who founded the institution in 1961 as the ''Institut Africain de Gen\u00e8ve'', or African Institute of Geneva. The Graduate Institute of Development Studies was among the pioneer institutions in Europe to develop the scholarly field of sustainable development. The school was also known for the critical view of many of its professors on development aid, as well as for its journal, the ''Cahiers de l'IUED''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosud.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=5076|title=L'IUED refait le monde depuis 40 ans  \u2013 Infosud \u2013 Tribune des Droits Humains|website=infosud.org|access-date=31 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102164743/http://www.infosud.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=5076|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was at the center of a huge international network.\n\n=== Recent merger ===\n\nIn 2008, the Graduate Institute of International Studies ({{interlanguage link|Institut universitaire de hautes \u00e9tudes internationales|fr|lt=HEI}}), absorbed the Graduate Institute of Development Studies ({{interlanguage link|Institut universitaire d'\u00e9tudes du d\u00e9veloppement|fr|lt=IUED}}), to create the current ''Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies'' (IHEID).\n\n== Academics ==\nAdmission to the Graduate Institute's study programmes is highly competitive, with only 14% of applicants attending the Graduate Institute in 2014.<ref name=\"Admission\">{{cite web |url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/relations-publiques/news-at-the-institute/news-archives.html/_/news/corporate/2014/nos-etudiants-representent-plus|title=Nos \u00e9tudiants repr\u00e9sentent plus de 100 nationalit\u00e9s|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref> The Institute awards its own degrees.<ref name=\"Diplomas\">{{cite web|url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/admissions/prospective-students/diplomas.html|title=Diplomas|accessdate=February 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221173004/http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/admissions/prospective-students/diplomas.html|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nIt does not award undergraduate degrees.\n\n=== Ranking ===\nAs a small institution offering exclusively master's and PhD programmes, the institute does not participate in [[College and university rankings|popular university ranking]].<ref name=\"ranking of Graduate Institute\">{{cite web|url= http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/about-us/institute/accreditation-reconnaissance-ran.html|title=Rankingy|accessdate=3 Dec 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Foreign Policy]]'''s 2014<ref name=\"The Best International Relations Schools in the World\">{{cite web|title=The Best International Relations Schools in the World|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/03/top-twenty-five-schools-international-relations/|website=foreignpolicy.com|publisher=Foreign Policy Magazine|accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref> ''[[Inside the Ivory Tower]]'' ranking of best international relations schools in the world, the Graduate Institute's master's program was ranked 24th among Master's Programs for Policy Career in International Relations.

The fall of the city took place on 29 May 1453, the culmination of a 53-day [[siege]] which had begun on 6 April 1453. \n\nThe attacking [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]], which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] (later called Mehmed the Conqueror), while the Byzantine army was led by [[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing [[Edirne|Adrianople]]. \n\nThe Fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, and effectively the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated back to 27 BC, lasting nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The capture of Constantinople, a city which marked the divide between Europe and [[Anatolia|Asia-Minor]], also allowed the Ottomans to more effectively [[Ottoman wars in Europe|invade mainland Europe]], eventually leading to Ottoman control of much of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]].\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event of the [[Late Middle Ages]] which is sometimes considered the end of the [[Middle Ages|Medieval period]].<ref name=\"GpAG8\" /> It was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] and walls to repel invaders. However, Constantinople's substantial fortifications were overcome with the use of [[gunpowder]], specifically in the form of large cannons and [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]].<ref name=\"econfallmill\" /> \n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century.

Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital.

This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983.

These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him.

His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. Minotto and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nTo the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, with Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Pegae Gate]] with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The [[Princes' Islands]] in the Sea of Marmara were taken by [[Suleiman Baltoghlu|Admiral Baltoghlu]]'s fleet.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|96\u201397}} Mehmed's massive cannon fired on the walls for weeks, but due to its imprecision and extremely slow rate of reloading the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, limiting the cannon's effect.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}}\n\n[[File:Kusatma Zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ottoman Turks transport their fleet overland into the [[Golden Horn]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under [[Suleiman Baltoghlu]] could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had previously stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese.

Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched. On the Byzantine side, a small Venetian fleet of 12 ships, after having searched the Aegean, reached the Capital on May 27 and reported to the Emperor that no large Venetian relief fleet was on its way.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|377}} On May 28, as the Ottoman army prepared for the final assault, large-scale religious processions were held in the city. In the evening a last solemn ceremony was held in the [[Hagia Sophia]], in which the Emperor and representatives of both the Latin and Greek church partook, together with nobility from both sides.<ref name=\"vasilievhistbyz2\" />{{rp|651\u2013652}}\n\nShortly after midnight on May 29 the all-out offensive began. The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the land troops,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"isbesepistle\" /><ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> [[Giovanni Giustiniani]], was grievously wounded during the attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders.{{NoteTag|Sources hostile towards the Genoese (such as the Venetian Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro), however, report that Longo was only lightly wounded or not wounded at all, but, overwhelmed by fear, simulated the wound to abandon the battlefield, determining the fall of the city.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward. According to some Ottoman sources Constantine was killed in an accidental encounter with Turkish marines a little further to the south, presumably while making his way to the Sea of Marmara in order to escape by sea.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\nAfter the initial assault, the Ottoman Army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help him better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection. After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets.\n\nOttoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be very heavy due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault.{{cn|date=February 2020}} According to the Venetian surgeon Nicolo Barbaro \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\".

Four days later on 2 June, the Sultan would find the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable and stores and shops were emptied.

Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460.

In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire's]] [[Capital city|capital]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The fall of the city took place on 29 May 1453, the culmination of a 53-day [[siege]] which had begun on 6 April 1453. \n\nThe attacking [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]], which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] (later called Mehmed the Conqueror), while the Byzantine army was led by [[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing [[Edirne|Adrianople]]. \n\nThe Fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, and effectively the end of the[[Roman Empire]], a state which dated back to 27 BC, lasting nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The capture of Constantinople, a city which marked the divide between Europe and [[Anatolia|Asia-Minor]], also allowed the Ottomans to more effectively [[Ottoman wars in Europe|invade mainland Europe]], eventually leading to Ottoman control of much of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]].\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event of the [[Late Middle Ages]] which is sometimes considered the end of the [[Middle Ages|Medieval period]].<ref name=\"GpAG8\" /> It was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] and walls to repel invaders. However, Constantinople's substantial fortifications were overcome with the use of [[gunpowder]], specifically in the form of large cannons and [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]].<ref name=\"econfallmill\" /> \n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The [[Princes' Islands]] in the Sea of Marmara were taken by [[Suleiman Baltoghlu|Admiral Baltoghlu]]'s fleet.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|96\u201397}} Mehmed's massive cannon fired on the walls for weeks, but due to its imprecision and extremely slow rate of reloading the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, limiting the cannon's effect.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}}\n\n[[File:Kusatma Zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ottoman Turks transport their fleet overland into the [[Golden Horn]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under [[Suleiman Baltoghlu]] could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had previously stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. They were placed under the command of [[Zagan Pasha]]. However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers.

[[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward.

It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn.

If they returned home, they would be treated according to their rank and religion, as if nothing had changed. | George Sphrantzes}}\n\nThe ''Hagia Sophia'' was converted into a mosque, but the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] was allowed to remain intact and [[Gennadius Scholarius]] was appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. This was once thought to be the origin of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman ''millet'' system]]; however, it is now considered a myth and no such system existed in the fifteenth century.<ref name=\"aMn4U\" /><ref name=\"AIhgF\" />\n\n[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Following the city's conquest, the Church of the [[Holy Wisdom]] (the ''[[Hagia Sophia]]'') was converted into a [[mosque]].]]\n\nAfter the sack, many feared other European Christian kingdoms would suffer the same fate as Constantinople. Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] and [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore]].<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}} Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.
