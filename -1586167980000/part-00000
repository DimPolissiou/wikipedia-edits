The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911.

A goalless draw with England and a 2\u20131 victory over Ireland did secure the side the runners-up spot.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/> With club sides in Wales attracting record crowds, the national team often found itself losing out to the domestic game. The victory over Ireland was held on the same day that [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] hosted [[South Shields F.C.|South Shields]] in the [[Football League Second Division]], with only 11,000 attending the national side's match in Swansea while more than 30,000 attended Cardiff's fixture.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> Disappointing results between 1922 and 1923 prompted a revamp of the team for the [[1923\u201324 British Home Championship]].

Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal. A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; [[Fred Keenor]] scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref> Only a goalless draw with Ireland stopped Wales finishing last, only a year after winning the tournament.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/>\n\nSquad withdrawals proved a continued problem for the Welsh side. When Wales was left short for the visit of Scotland in the [[1925\u201326 British Home Championship|1925\u201326 Championship]], Ted Robbins called up debutant [[Jack Lewis (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lewis]] after following him to a train station in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City.<ref name=\"s105106\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a last minute interception for the final match against England.

Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until [[Wilf Lewis]] secured the win for Wales, scoring the winning goal by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net.

The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland which was largely unaffected by the ruling as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience.

The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book ''Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football'', Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\"<ref name=\"s195197\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=195\u2013197}}</ref> The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad.

Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager [[Don Revie]] in order to avoid selection with the national side.<ref name=\"s186187\"/> [[John Toshack]], who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles [...] some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\"<ref name=\"s186187\"/> An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when it failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the organisation's members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger [[Gil Reece]], would have to disembark.

The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time.

Over the summer, his girlfriend Jetun Rush had given birth to a baby boy that the two named Brandon. For reasons unclear, Rush became withdrawn toward Wilson. While the two were still seeing each other, Rush had been avoiding Wilson and did not allow him to see his son. This greatly upset Wilson, who continued to try to figure out why Rush was acting in such a manner. So, as lunchtime came at Simeon on the 20th, Wilson elected to forgo eating with his teammates and instead wait for Rush.\n\n===Billy Moore and Omar Dixon arrive at Simeon===\nAs this was going on, two students from nearby [[Calumet High School (Chicago)|Calumet High School]], Billy Moore and Omar Dixon, had made their way to the school. Moore and Dixon had cut school that day, and Moore had a .22 caliber pistol in his possession. Moore's cousin had been robbed of $10, allegedly by a student of Simeon, and he brought the gun with him to avenge his cousin. The conflict, however, was resolved before Moore got there.\n\nThe two boys then decided to hang out for a little while and wait to see if Erica Murphy, Wilson's classmate and a friend of Moore's, was around. Murphy met up with the two boys shortly thereafter, and Moore and Dixon followed her to a luncheonette on South Vincennes Avenue. Murphy went in alone, while Moore and Dixon chose to wait. As they did so, Wilson and his girlfriend came walking up South Vincennes and, as before, Rush was avoiding him.\n\n===The shooting===\nIn his desperation to get Rush to talk to him, Wilson was unaware of his surroundings. He never saw Moore standing outside the luncheonette and bumped into him as he went up the street. Moore was not pleased and yelled up the street at Wilson to watch where he was going.<ref>[http://www.csnchicago.com/ben-wilsons-killer-i-dont-consider-myself-criminal \"Ben Wilson's killer: 'I don't consider myself a criminal' \"], ''CSN Chicago'', 21 Nov 2012.</ref>\n\nWilson, now angered, then turned and headed back toward Moore and a loud argument broke out. At one point, Moore drew the .22 from his pocket. This made Wilson madder and caused him to taunt Moore and dare him to fire. After Wilson lunged forward at him Moore, who would later say that Wilson was \"punking\" him\" pulled the trigger and fired off two rounds. The first struck Wilson in his groin while the second struck him in his abdomen and caused significant internal bleeding.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune October 1985\">{{cite news |title=Basketball Star's Slaying Described By Girlfriend |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-10-09/news/8503080823_1_ben-wilson-simeon-vocational-high-school-benjamin-wilson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |last=Myers |first=Linnet |date=October 9, 1985 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> Moore and Dixon then fled the scene, with Moore heading straight for Murphy's house.\n\n==Aftermath of the shooting==\nAt 12:37 PM local time, a call was placed to 911 for emergency assistance. It took paramedics forty minutes to arrive at the scene, and to further complicate matters Chicago emergency protocol in place forced the ambulance to take Wilson to the closest available hospital. That hospital, St. Bernard Hospital in the [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] section, was not equipped to handle major trauma cases and thus Wilson was not able to be seen by a doctor for several hours. His condition progressively worsened during the hours that followed, which led his mother, Mary, to have her son taken off of life support. Early the next morning, November 21, Wilson died.<ref name=\"Wordpress August 2012\">{{cite web |title=Ben Wilson: A Life Cut Short but the Memories Remain |url=http://historyrat.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/ben-wilson/ |publisher=The History Rat|date=August 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes February 2003\">{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; A Dead Friend, a Living Memory |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/sports/pro-basketball-a-dead-friend-a-living-memory.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Berkow |first=Ira |date=February 14, 1993 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Arrests and trial==\nBilly Moore remained at Erica Murphy's home for most of the rest of the day. Later that night, Chicago police arrested him there and shortly thereafter apprehended Omar Dixon. The two boys were brought into interrogation rooms and questioned by detectives for most of the night, eventually signing confessions that they later recanted. Moore and Dixon were both charged with murder, and Cook County prosecutors elected to charge both of them as adults due to the nature of the crime.\n\nThe trial began in the fall of 1985. State Attorneys Kenneth Malatesta and Arthur Hill presided over the prosecution and presented the police's theory, which was in the confessions that were recanted: Moore pulled the gun on Wilson as Dixon tried to pick his pockets, and after Dixon robbed Wilson, he ordered Moore to shoot Wilson. The prosecution's lead witness was Jetun Rush, who testified to that effect. The prosecutors also tried to introuce evidence that the boys were members of a street gang, but were precluded from doing so.<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-12-8503090624-story.html</ref>\n\nThe defense attorneys for both boys denied the charges vehemently. Dixon's attorney, Brian Dosch, called his client's confession \"garbage\" and destroyed a copy of it in front of reporters. Isaiah Gant, Moore's attorney, argued that his client was only trying to protect himself from the much larger Wilson. He also expressed that he felt both of the defendants were being \"railroaded\" by overzealous law enforcement officials whose desperation to hold someone accountable for the murder of a star athlete compromised their integrity and led them to create false case theory.\n\nMalatesta, in response to these charges, chose instead to focus on the actions that led to Wilson's death. In his closing on October 11, 1985, he urged the jury to focus less on the celebrity of the victim and simply follow the law. The jury was only out for about one hour before returning guilty verdicts against both Moore and Dixon.<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-12-8503090624-story.html</ref> A month later, Moore was sentenced to 40 years in prison while Dixon received 30.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSimeon honored Wilson by retiring his number 25. However, the school still issues the number every year to the best player on the team.\n\nOmar Dixon was released on parole in 2000. In 2007 he was arrested again and charged with three weapons offenses, for which he began serving a 40-year sentence in 2011.<ref>https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Offender/pages/inmatesearch.aspx</ref> Billy Moore was paroled in 2005.\n\nThe life and murder of Ben Wilson has been featured in two documentary films produced in the 21st century. The first, directed by [[Coodie and Chike]] and produced in association with [[ESPN Films]], was titled ''[[Benji (2012 film)|Benji]]'' and made its debut at the 2012 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. The most recent was first screened during the 2020 NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago and was titled ''Two Sides of the Gun: A Story of Reconciliation''.

As a junior, he had led the Simeon Wolverines basketball team to the Illinois Class AA state championship, and over the summer he was given the honor of being ranked as the best high school player in the entire nation.<ref name=\"PopMatters October 2012\">{{cite magazine |title='Benji' Revisits the Story of Chicago Basketball Star Ben Wilson |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/164743-benji-remembers-chicago-basketball-star-ben-wilson/ |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |last=Fuchs |first=Cynthia |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Day of the shooting==\n===Domestic problem===\nIn addition to all of the accolades that were bestowed upon him, Wilson's life was also greatly affected by the fact that he had now become a father. Over the summer, his girlfriend Jetun Rush had given birth to a baby boy that the two named Brandon. For reasons unclear, Rush became withdrawn toward Wilson. While the two were still seeing each other, Rush had been avoiding Wilson and did not allow him to see his son. This greatly upset Wilson, who continued to try to figure out why Rush was acting in such a manner. So, as lunchtime came at Simeon on the 20th, Wilson elected to forgo eating with his teammates and instead wait for Rush. \n\n===Billy Moore and Omar Dixon arrive at Simeon===\nAs this was going on, two students from nearby [[Calumet High School (Chicago)|Calumet High School]], Billy Moore and Omar Dixon, had made their way to the school. Moore and Dixon had cut school that day, and Moore had a .22 caliber pistol in his possession. Moore's cousin had been robbed of $10, allegedly by a student of Simeon, and he brought the gun with him to avenge his cousin. The conflict, however, was resolved before Moore got there. \n\nThe two boys then decided to hang out for a little while and wait to see if Erica Murphy, Wilson's classmate and a friend of Moore's, was around. Murphy met up with the two boys shortly thereafter, and Moore and Dixon followed her to a luncheonette on South Vincennes Avenue. Murphy went in alone, while Moore and Dixon chose to wait. As they did so, Wilson and his girlfriend came walking up South Vincennes and, as before, Rush was avoiding him. \n\n===The shooting===\nIn his desperation to get Rush to talk to him, Wilson was unaware of his surroundings. He never saw Moore standing outside the luncheonette and bumped into him as he went up the street. Moore was not pleased and yelled up the street at Wilson to watch where he was going.<ref>[http://www.csnchicago.com/ben-wilsons-killer-i-dont-consider-myself-criminal \"Ben Wilson's killer: 'I don't consider myself a criminal' \"], ''CSN Chicago'', 21 Nov 2012.</ref>\n\nWilson, now angered, then turned and headed back toward Moore and a loud argument broke out. At one point, Moore drew the .22 from his pocket. This made Wilson madder and caused him to taunt Moore and dare him to fire. After Wilson lunged forward at him Moore, who would later say that Wilson was \"punking\" him\" pulled the trigger and fired off two rounds. The first struck Wilson in his groin while the second struck him in his abdomen and caused significant internal bleeding.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune October 1985\">{{cite news |title=Basketball Star's Slaying Described By Girlfriend |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-10-09/news/8503080823_1_ben-wilson-simeon-vocational-high-school-benjamin-wilson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |last=Myers |first=Linnet |date=October 9, 1985 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> Moore and Dixon then fled the scene, with Moore heading straight for Murphy's house.\n\n==Aftermath of the shooting==\nAt 12:37 PM local time, a call was placed to 911 for emergency assistance. It took paramedics forty minutes to arrive at the scene, and to further complicate matters Chicago emergency protocol in place forced the ambulance to take Wilson to the closest available hospital. That hospital, St. Bernard Hospital in the [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] section, was not equipped to handle major trauma cases and thus Wilson was not able to be seen by a doctor for several hours. His condition progressively worsened during the hours that followed, which led his mother, Mary, to have her son taken off of life support. Early the next morning, November 21, Wilson died.<ref name=\"Wordpress August 2012\">{{cite web |title=Ben Wilson: A Life Cut Short but the Memories Remain |url=http://historyrat.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/ben-wilson/ |publisher=The History Rat|date=August 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes February 2003\">{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; A Dead Friend, a Living Memory |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/sports/pro-basketball-a-dead-friend-a-living-memory.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Berkow |first=Ira |date=February 14, 1993 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Arrests and trial==\nBilly Moore remained at Erica Murphy's home for most of the rest of the day. Later that night, Chicago police arrested him there and shortly thereafter apprehended Omar Dixon. The two boys were brought into interrogation rooms and questioned by detectives for most of the night, eventually signing confessions that they later recanted. Moore and Dixon were both charged with murder, and Cook County prosecutors elected to charge both of them as adults due to the nature of the crime.\n\nThe trial began in the fall of 1985. State Attorneys Kenneth Malatesta and Arthur Hill presided over the prosecution and presented the police's theory, which was in the confessions that were recanted: Moore pulled the gun on Wilson as Dixon tried to pick his pockets, and after Dixon robbed Wilson, he ordered Moore to shoot Wilson. The prosecution's lead witness was Jetun Rush, who testified to that effect. The prosecutors also tried to introuce evidence that the boys were members of a street gang, but were precluded from doing so.<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-12-8503090624-story.html</ref>\n\nThe defense attorneys for both boys denied the charges vehemently. Dixon's attorney, Brian Dosch, called his client's confession \"garbage\" and destroyed a copy of it in front of reporters. Isaiah Gant, Moore's attorney, argued that his client was only trying to protect himself from the much larger Wilson. He also expressed that he felt both of the defendants were being \"railroaded\" by overzealous law enforcement officials whose desperation to hold someone accountable for the murder of a star athlete compromised their integrity and led them to create false case theory. \n\nMalatesta, in response to these charges, chose instead to focus on the actions that led to Wilson's death. In his closing on October 11, 1985, he urged the jury to focus less on the celebrity of the victim and simply follow the law. The jury was only out for about one hour before returning guilty verdicts against both Moore and Dixon. <ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-12-8503090624-story.html</ref> A month later, Moore was sentenced to 40 years in prison while Dixon received 30.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSimeon honored Wilson by retiring his number 25. However, the school still issues the number every year to the best player on the team.\n\nOmar Dixon was released on parole in 2000. In 2007 he was arrested again and charged with three weapons offenses, for which he began serving a 40 year sentence in 2011.<ref>https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Offender/pages/inmatesearch.aspx</ref> Billy Moore was paroled in 2005.\n\nThe life and murder of Ben Wilson has been featured in two documentary films produced in the 21st century. The first, directed by [[Coodie and Chike]] and produced in association with [[ESPN Films]], was titled ''[[Benji (2012 film)|Benji]]'' and made its debut at the 2012 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

This was the third FIFA World Cup tournament in succession that was hosted by a Spanish-speaking country, after Argentina 1978, and Spain 1982.\n\nIt was won by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (their second title, after winning in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]). Argentina was captained by the 25-year old [[Diego Maradona]], who played a large part in his team's success.

Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city hosted 10 total matches (the Jalisco Stadium hosted seven matches, the Tres de Marzo Stadium in Zapopan hosted three), Monterrey hosted 8 matches (The Tecnologico Stadium and the Universitario Stadium in San Nicolas de los Garza hosted four matches each), and the Cuauht\u00e9moc Stadium in [[Puebla]] hosted 5 matches.\n\nThe hot, humid and rainy summer weather in Mexico varied from humid desert locations like Monterrey to tropical locations such as Guadalajara; but perhaps the greatest hardship the players had to contend with was the high altitude of the Mexican locations. With the exception of the 93-104&nbsp;\u00b0F (34-40&nbsp;\u00b0C) temperatures of Monterrey (still 2,000 feet above sea level), all of the stadia were located in cities that varied anywhere from Guadalajara being {{convert|5138|ft}} above sea level to Toluca being {{convert|8730|ft}} above sea level, making conditions very difficult for the players running around in these stadia- but the higher the cities, the less intense the heat.

Meanwhile, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] beat [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] 3\u20131, with [[Diego Maradona]] playing a major part. [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] drew 1\u20131, Maradona and [[Alessandro Altobelli]] scoring. South Korea and Bulgaria also drew 1\u20131 in a downpour. The final set of matches saw Argentina beating Bulgaria 2\u20130, and Italy narrowly defeating South Korea 3\u20132.\n\nIn Group B [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] beat [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 2\u20131, and despite being held 1\u20131 by [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], they won the group after a further win over [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]], 1\u20130. Paraguay and Belgium also progressed after both beating Iraq and drawing with each other.\n\nGroup C pitted a strong [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]-dominated [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] side against the reigning European champions [[France national football team|France]]. They drew with each other 1\u20131, with a goal scored by [[Vasyl Rats]]. France beat [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] 1\u20130 and finished in 2nd place in the group after beating [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], 3\u20130. Hungary had earlier lost 6\u20130 against the Soviet Union, which won the group due to goal difference.\n\nGroup D saw [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] start against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], winning 1\u20130 after the referee failed to validate a legal goal scored by [[M\u00edchel (footballer, born 1963)|M\u00edchel]]. [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] began their campaign with a draw against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. Northern Ireland were then narrowly beaten by Spain before losing to Brazil 3\u20130 in their final match. This match saw a goal from [[Josimar]] on his debut and was also the final time [[Pat Jennings]] played for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Spain qualified along with Brazil after defeating Algeria 3\u20130.\n\n[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] stormed through Group E, dubbed the [[group of death]], with a 100 per cent record. They beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 1\u20130 in their first game, then hammered [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 6\u20131, with [[Preben Elkj\u00e6r Larsen]] hitting a hat-trick. Denmark beat one of the favourites to win the tournament, [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], 2\u20130 thanks to a [[Jesper Olsen]] penalty and a goal from [[John Eriksen]]. After losing to Denmark, Scotland took the lead against West Germany thanks to a [[Gordon Strachan]] goal, but the West Germans fought back to win 2\u20131. After a violent 0\u20130 draw against Uruguay, the Scots were eliminated from the tournament. During that game [[Jos\u00e9 Batista]] of Uruguay was [[misconduct (football)|sent off]] after less than one minute of play for a foul on Strachan, a [[FIFA World Cup records|World Cup record]] that still stands. West Germany went through to the second round despite a loss against Denmark.\n\n[[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] topped Group F after holding both [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[England national football team|England]] to goalless draws, and beating [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 3\u20131. By doing so, they became the first African team, and only the second nation from outside Europe and the Americas (after North Korea in 1966), to reach the second round. England lost 1\u20130 to Portugal, followed by a 0\u20130 draw against Morocco in which they lost captain [[Bryan Robson]] to injury (for the remainder of the tournament) and vice-captain [[Ray Wilkins]] to a red card (he was never to be selected for England again, even after having served his obligatory one-match ban). In their last first-round game, with the captaincy taken over by [[Peter Shilton]] in goal, a first-half [[Gary Lineker]] hat-trick helped the reshaped side beat Poland 3\u20130 \u2013 although losing yet another player to a ban for the next round, Terry Fenwick receiving his second booking of the tournament. Poland had previously beaten Portugal, and in the end the Portuguese were the only team from Group F to be eliminated in the first round. Portugal, making their first appearance in 20 years, went on strike (in the [[Saltillo Affair]]) during the competition. Players refused to train between their first and second games (against England and Poland) and were eliminated after a loss to [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] in the final group match.\n\n=== Second round and quarter-finals ===\nBelgium beat the Soviet Union 4\u20133, despite a hat-trick by the Soviets' [[Igor Belanov]]. The game was level at 2\u20132 after 90 minutes, and in extra time [[Stephane Demol]] and [[Nico Claesen]] put Belgium 4\u20132 up. Belanov scored from the penalty spot with nine minutes remaining, but neither he nor any of his teammates could find a fourth goal for the Soviet Union. At the [[Estadio Olimpico Universitario|Olympic University Stadium]] in Mexico City, the European champions France ended Italy's reign as world champions with a 2\u20130 victory thanks to goals from [[Michel Platini]] and [[Yannick Stopyra]]. In the rematch of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final]], Argentina just edged out South American champions Uruguay in Puebla thanks to a 42nd-minute strike from [[Pedro Pasculli]]. The all-South American affair had a Diego Maradona's goal disallowed.\n\nIn Quer\u00e9taro, Denmark were eliminated as they went from a 1\u20130 lead to a 5\u20131 battering against Spain; key player [[Frank Arnesen]] was suspended for the game after being sent off against West Germany in their last group match, for taking a swipe at German playmaker [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]]. The Danes scored first, with a Jesper Olsen penalty, but they were then taken apart by a devastating performance from [[Emilio Butrague\u00f1o|Butrague\u00f1o]] of Spain, who scored four of his team's five goals. At the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]] in Mexico City, England progressed to the quarter-finals comfortably when they saw off Paraguay 3\u20130, while Brazil brushed aside Poland 4\u20130. West Germany had a much harder time getting past Morocco, for whom goalkeeper [[Badou Zaki]] had an outstanding game. Morocco held out until the 87th minute, when Lothar Matth\u00e4us scored the only goal of the match with a free kick. Mexico won 2\u20130 against Bulgaria with an outstanding scissor-kick goal by [[Manuel Negrete Arias|Manuel Negrete]] which is honored by a remembrance plaque at [[Estadio Azteca|the Azteca]].\n\nIn the quarter-finals, France faced three-time world champion Brazil in Guadalajara. Brazil were well on top in the early stages, and Careca put them one up after 18 minutes. Five minutes before half-time, France drew level when Michel Platini scored his 41st goal after converting a cross from [[Dominique Rocheteau]]. Brazil had a chance to regain the lead in the second half when Branco was fouled by French keeper [[Jo\u00ebl Bats]] in the penalty area. [[Zico]] got up to take the kick, but Bats saved Zico's penalty.\n\nThe match went to extra time, and France finished slightly the stronger of the two sides. No more goals were scored, and so it was time for a penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms \u2013 but not for long. [[J\u00falio C\u00e9sar da Silva|Julio Cesar]] struck the post with his penalty, and [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]] then scored to put France through 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nTwo other quarter-finals were also decided on penalties. [[Jan Ceulemans]] put Belgium ahead against Spain in the 35th minute, but Spanish substitute Se\u00f1or equalised with five minutes to go. No more goals were scored in extra time, and Belgium won the shoot-out 5\u20134. West Germany and Mexico drew 0\u20130 after extra time, and the West Germans eliminated the hosts 4\u20131 on penalties. As a curiosity, the German goalkeeper [[Harald Schumacher]] jumped to the right in the three Mexican penalties (stopping two of them).\n\nThe quarter-final between Argentina and England at the Azteca featured two very different goals in the second half by Diego Maradona: the first was scored illegally, as he punched the ball into the goal past England goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]]. The referee did not see the handball and the goal was given as valid. After the game, Maradona claimed the goal was scored \"A bit with the head of Maradona and another bit with the hand of God\"; it became known as the \"[[The hand of God|Hand of God]]\" goal. For his second goal, voted \"[[Goal of the Century]]\" in 2002 on the FIFA website, Maradona dribbled half the length of the field past five English players before scoring. With 20 minutes to go, the introduction of John Barnes as a substitute changed the tide of play in England's favour, as he pinged cross after cross into the Argentine penalty area: with 9 minutes to go, Lineker got on the end of one and scored, then almost repeated the dose six minutes later but was just unable to reach the ball thanks to a timely block by Olarticoechea: 2\u20131 to Argentina was the final score. In Argentina, the game was seen as revenge for the [[Falklands War]].<ref>El Diego \u2013 Diego Maradona, Page 127, {{ISBN|0-224-07190-4}}</ref>\n\n=== Semi-finals, third-place match, and final ===\nIn the first semi-final match, [[Andreas Brehme]] put West Germany 1\u20130 ahead against France in the ninth minute in Guadalajara, but the outcome remained in doubt until two minutes from time when [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] made it 2\u20130, and West Germany were in the final for the second World Cup in succession. In the second semi-final match, Maradona struck twice in the second half as Argentina beat Belgium 2\u20130 at the Azteca. France went on to defeat Belgium in the third-place match, 4\u20132.\n\nSo it was to be the South American Argentina vs the European West Germany at the final at the Azteca, the second time this massive stadium would host a World Cup Final ([[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|the first]] in 1970). [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown|Jose Brown]] put Argentina one up midway through the first half of the final, and when [[Jorge Valdano]] scored a second for the South Americans in the 55th minute, Argentina looked to be strolling to victory. West Germany then staged a spirited comeback. [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] pulled one back in the 74th minute, and six minutes later Rudi V\u00f6ller hit the equaliser. With seven minutes remaining, a pass from Maradona gave [[Jorge Burruchaga]] the chance to score the winner for Argentina. Eight years on from their [[1978 FIFA World Cup|home triumph]], Argentina regained the world title and 30 million people in Argentina celebrated in the streets after the final victory. Maradona was the Golden Ball winner as the best player of the tournament, while Gary Lineker of England won the Golden Boot as the leading scorer of the World Cup with six goals.\n\n== Results ==\n''All times are [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] ([[UTC\u221206:00|UTC\u22126]])''\n\n=== Group stage ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Key to colours in group tables\n|-\n|bgcolor=#ccffcc style=\"width: 20px;\"|\n|align=left|Group winners, runners-up, and [[#Ranking of third-placed teams|best four third-placed teams]] advance to the [[#Round of 16|Round of 16]]\n|}\n\n==== Group A ====\n{{Main|1986 FIFA World Cup Group A}}\n{{1986 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group A}}\nSouth Korea made their first appearance since 1954.

1986.  The tournament was the second to feature a 24-team format.  With European nations not allowed to host after the previous World Cup in Spain, Colombia had been originally chosen to host the competition by [[FIFA]] but, largely due to economic reasons, was not able to do so and officially resigned in 1982.  Mexico was selected as the new host in May 1983, thus becoming the first country to host the World Cup more than once. This was the third FIFA World Cup tournament in succession that was hosted by a Spanish-speaking country, after Argentina 1978, and Spain 1982.\n\nIt was won by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (their second title, after winning in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]). Argentina was captained by the 25-year old [[Diego Maradona]], who played a large part in his team's success. Maradona scored the \"[[The hand of God|Hand of God]]\" goal, as well as another voted \"Goal of the Century\", in the [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)|same quarter-final]] against England. These were two of the five goals that Maradona scored during the tournament, and he also created another five for his teammates.<ref name=Over>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=502188/index.html |title=1986 FIFA World Cup Mexico \u2013 Overview |work=FIFA.com |publisher=[[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> Argentina beat [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3\u20132 in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at [[Mexico City]]'s [[Estadio Azteca]].

This second World Cup in Mexico came 16 years after the first one in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]. A [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|severe earthquake]] in September 1985, eight months before the tournament, cast doubt over Mexico's ability to organize the event, but the stadia were not affected and it was decided to go ahead with the preparations.\n\nAs 1986 had been declared the International Year of Peace by the [[United Nations]], the advertising boards of all the stadia displayed the [[FIFA]] and [[United Nations]] logos along with the legend \"Football for Peace \u2013 Peace Year\".\n\nFor the design of the logo an unofficial motto was adopted:  \"El Mundo Unido por Un Bal\u00f3n\" (\"The World United by a Ball\").\n\n== Mascot ==\nThe [[FIFA World Cup mascots|official mascot]] of the 1986 World Cup was ''Pique'', a [[jalape\u00f1o]] pepper, characteristic of [[Mexican cuisine]], with a moustache, a Colimote [[sombrero]], and Mexican football team colours. Its name comes from ''picante'', Spanish for spicy, and was also a pun on the \"PK\" abbreviation of the football term [[penalty shot|penalty kick]].\n\nThe character caused a degree of controversy within Mexico for its ethnic stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=Soccer's Most Wanted\u2122: The Top 10 Book of Clumsy Keepers, Clever Crosses, and Outlandish Oddities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fvyc3QC0TYC&pg=PA247|date=1 September 2001|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57488-365-7|page=247}}</ref>\n\n== Qualification ==\n\n{{Main|1986 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nThree teams qualified for the World Cup for the first time: [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]].

The Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, the largest stadium used for the tournament, hosted nine matches (including the final), more than any other stadium used. Mexico City hosted 13 total matches; the Olimpico Universitario Stadium hosted four matches (if the Mexico City suburban town Nezahualcoyotl's 3 matches are included, this brings the total up to 16 matches; nearly a third of all matches in this tournament). Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city hosted 10 total matches (the Jalisco Stadium hosted seven matches, the Tres de Marzo Stadium in Zapopan hosted three), Monterrey hosted 8 matches (The Tecnologico Stadium and the Universitario Stadium in San Nicolas de los Garza hosted four matches each), and the Cuauht\u00e9moc Stadium in [[Puebla]] hosted 5 matches.\n\nThe hot, humid and rainy summer weather in Mexico varied from humid desert locations like Monterrey to tropical locations such as Guadalajara; but perhaps the greatest hardship the players had to contend with was the high altitude of the Mexican locations. With the exception of the 93-104&nbsp;\u00b0F (34-40&nbsp;\u00b0C) temperatures of Monterrey (still 2,000 feet above sea level), all of the stadia were located in cities that varied anywhere from Guadalajara being {{convert|5138|ft}} above sea level to Toluca being {{convert|8730|ft}} above sea level, making conditions very difficult for the players running around in these stadia- but the higher the cities, the less intense the heat. Mexico City, the location of the final match and the location where the most matches were played was {{convert|7380|ft}} above sea level and the weather there was not as hot as in other cities used in this World Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=2| [[Mexico City]]\n!

Paraguay and Belgium also progressed after both beating Iraq and drawing with each other.\n\nGroup C pitted a strong [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]-dominated [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] side against the reigning European champions [[France national football team|France]]. They drew with each other 1\u20131, with a goal scored by [[Vasyl Rats]]. France beat [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] 1\u20130 and finished in 2nd place in the group after beating [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], 3\u20130. Hungary had earlier lost 6\u20130 against the Soviet Union, which won the group due to goal difference.\n\nGroup D saw [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] start against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], winning 1\u20130 after the referee failed to validate a legal goal scored by [[M\u00edchel (footballer, born 1963)|M\u00edchel]]. [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] began their campaign with a draw against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. Northern Ireland were then narrowly beaten by Spain before losing to Brazil 3\u20130 in their final match. This match saw a goal from [[Josimar]] on his debut and was also the final time [[Pat Jennings]] played for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Spain qualified along with Brazil after defeating Algeria 3\u20130.\n\n[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] stormed through Group E, dubbed the [[group of death]], with a 100 per cent record. They beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 1\u20130 in their first game, then hammered [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 6\u20131, with [[Preben Elkj\u00e6r Larsen]] hitting a hat-trick. Denmark beat one of the favourites to win the tournament, [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], 2\u20130 thanks to a [[Jesper Olsen]] penalty and a goal from [[John Eriksen]]. After losing to Denmark, Scotland took the lead against West Germany thanks to a [[Gordon Strachan]] goal, but the West Germans fought back to win 2\u20131. After a violent 0\u20130 draw against Uruguay, the Scots were eliminated from the tournament. During that game [[Jos\u00e9 Batista]] of Uruguay was [[misconduct (football)|sent off]] after less than one minute of play for a foul on Strachan, a [[FIFA World Cup records|World Cup record]] that still stands. West Germany went through to the second round despite a loss against Denmark.\n\n[[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] topped Group F after holding both [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[England national football team|England]] to goalless draws, and beating [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 3\u20131. By doing so, they became the first African team, and only the second nation from outside Europe and the Americas (after North Korea in 1966), to reach the second round. England lost 1\u20130 to Portugal, followed by a 0\u20130 draw against Morocco in which they lost captain [[Bryan Robson]] to injury (for the remainder of the tournament) and vice-captain [[Ray Wilkins]] to a red card (he was never to be selected for England again, even after having served his obligatory one-match ban). In their last first-round game, with the captaincy taken over by [[Peter Shilton]] in goal, a first-half [[Gary Lineker]] hat-trick helped the reshaped side beat Poland 3\u20130 \u2013 although losing yet another player to a ban for the next round, Terry Fenwick receiving his second booking of the tournament. Poland had previously beaten Portugal, and in the end the Portuguese were the only team from Group F to be eliminated in the first round. Portugal, making their first appearance in 20 years, went on strike (in the [[Saltillo Affair]]) during the competition. Players refused to train between their first and second games (against England and Poland) and were eliminated after a loss to [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] in the final group match.\n\n=== Second round and quarter-finals ===\nBelgium beat the Soviet Union 4\u20133, despite a hat-trick by the Soviets' [[Igor Belanov]]. The game was level at 2\u20132 after 90 minutes, and in extra time [[Stephane Demol]] and [[Nico Claesen]] put Belgium 4\u20132 up. Belanov scored from the penalty spot with nine minutes remaining, but neither he nor any of his teammates could find a fourth goal for the Soviet Union. At the [[Estadio Olimpico Universitario|Olympic University Stadium]] in Mexico City, the European champions France ended Italy's reign as world champions with a 2\u20130 victory thanks to goals from [[Michel Platini]] and [[Yannick Stopyra]]. In the rematch of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final]], Argentina just edged out South American champions Uruguay in Puebla thanks to a 42nd-minute strike from [[Pedro Pasculli]]. The all-South American affair had a Diego Maradona's goal disallowed.\n\nIn Quer\u00e9taro, Denmark were eliminated as they went from a 1\u20130 lead to a 5\u20131 battering against Spain; key player [[Frank Arnesen]] was suspended for the game after being sent off against West Germany in their last group match, for taking a swipe at German playmaker [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]]. The Danes scored first, with a Jesper Olsen penalty, but they were then taken apart by a devastating performance from [[Emilio Butrague\u00f1o|Butrague\u00f1o]] of Spain, who scored four of his team's five goals. At the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]] in Mexico City, England progressed to the quarter-finals comfortably when they saw off Paraguay 3\u20130, while Brazil brushed aside Poland 4\u20130. West Germany had a much harder time getting past Morocco, for whom goalkeeper [[Badou Zaki]] had an outstanding game. Morocco held out until the 87th minute, when Lothar Matth\u00e4us scored the only goal of the match with a free kick. Mexico won 2\u20130 against Bulgaria with an outstanding scissor-kick goal by [[Manuel Negrete Arias|Manuel Negrete]] which is honored by a remembrance plaque at [[Estadio Azteca|the Azteca]].\n\nIn the quarter-finals, France faced three-time world champion Brazil in Guadalajara. Brazil were well on top in the early stages, and Careca put them one up after 18 minutes. Five minutes before half-time, France drew level when Michel Platini scored his 41st goal after converting a cross from [[Dominique Rocheteau]]. Brazil had a chance to regain the lead in the second half when Branco was fouled by French keeper [[Jo\u00ebl Bats]] in the penalty area. [[Zico]] got up to take the kick, but Bats saved Zico's penalty.\n\nThe match went to extra time, and France finished slightly the stronger of the two sides. No more goals were scored, and so it was time for a penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms \u2013 but not for long. [[J\u00falio C\u00e9sar da Silva|Julio Cesar]] struck the post with his penalty, and [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]] then scored to put France through 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nTwo other quarter-finals were also decided on penalties. [[Jan Ceulemans]] put Belgium ahead against Spain in the 35th minute, but Spanish substitute Se\u00f1or equalised with five minutes to go. No more goals were scored in extra time, and Belgium won the shoot-out 5\u20134. West Germany and Mexico drew 0\u20130 after extra time, and the West Germans eliminated the hosts 4\u20131 on penalties. As a curiosity, the German goalkeeper [[Harald Schumacher]] jumped to the right in the three Mexican penalties (stopping two of them).\n\nThe quarter-final between Argentina and England at the Azteca featured two very different goals in the second half by Diego Maradona: the first was scored illegally, as he punched the ball into the goal past England goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]]. The referee did not see the handball and the goal was given as valid. After the game, Maradona claimed the goal was scored \"A bit with the head of Maradona and another bit with the hand of God\"; it became known as the \"[[The hand of God|Hand of God]]\" goal. For his second goal, voted \"[[Goal of the Century]]\" in 2002 on the FIFA website, Maradona dribbled half the length of the field past five English players before scoring. With 20 minutes to go, the introduction of John Barnes as a substitute changed the tide of play in England's favour, as he pinged cross after cross into the Argentine penalty area: with 9 minutes to go, Lineker got on the end of one and scored, then almost repeated the dose six minutes later but was just unable to reach the ball thanks to a timely block by Olarticoechea: 2\u20131 to Argentina was the final score. In Argentina, the game was seen as revenge for the [[Falklands War]].<ref>El Diego \u2013 Diego Maradona, Page 127, {{ISBN|0-224-07190-4}}</ref>\n\n=== Semi-finals, third-place match, and final ===\nIn the first semi-final match, [[Andreas Brehme]] put West Germany 1\u20130 ahead against France in the ninth minute in Guadalajara, but the outcome remained in doubt until two minutes from time when [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] made it 2\u20130, and West Germany were in the final for the second World Cup in succession. In the second semi-final match, Maradona struck twice in the second half as Argentina beat Belgium 2\u20130 at the Azteca. France went on to defeat Belgium in the third-place match, 4\u20132.\n\nSo it was to be the South American Argentina vs the European West Germany at the final at the Azteca, the second time this massive stadium would host a World Cup Final ([[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|the first]] in 1970). [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown|Jose Brown]] put Argentina one up midway through the first half of the final, and when [[Jorge Valdano]] scored a second for the South Americans in the 55th minute, Argentina looked to be strolling to victory. West Germany then staged a spirited comeback. [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] pulled one back in the 74th minute, and six minutes later Rudi V\u00f6ller hit the equaliser. With seven minutes remaining, a pass from Maradona gave [[Jorge Burruchaga]] the chance to score the winner for Argentina. Eight years on from their [[1978 FIFA World Cup|home triumph]], Argentina regained the world title and 30 million people in Argentina celebrated in the streets after the final victory. Maradona was the Golden Ball winner as the best player of the tournament, while Gary Lineker of England won the Golden Boot as the leading scorer of the World Cup with six goals.\n\n== Results ==\n''All times are [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] ([[UTC\u221206:00|UTC\u22126]])''\n\n=== Group stage ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Key to colours in group tables\n|-\n|bgcolor=#ccffcc style=\"width: 20px;\"|\n|align=left|Group winners, runners-up, and [[#Ranking of third-placed teams|best four third-placed teams]] advance to the [[#Round of 16|Round of 16]]\n|}\n\n==== Group A ====\n{{Main|1986 FIFA World Cup Group A}}\n{{1986 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group A}}\nSouth Korea made their first appearance since 1954.

Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

Depending on the taxonomist, between 19 and 40 species of plum exist. From this diversity only two species, the hexaploid European plum (''[[Prunus domestica]]'') and the diploid Japanese plum (''[[Prunus salicina]]'' and hybrids), are of worldwide commercial significance. The origin of these commercially important species is uncertain but may have involved P. cerasifera and possibly P. spinosa as ancestors.
