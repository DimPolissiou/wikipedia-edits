Barry raced for numerous world-class teams with the role of '[[domestique]]'. His greatest personal successes were placing eighth in the [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's road race|2008 Beijing Olympics' road race]], finishing second in the [[Canadian National Road Race Championships]] in 2001 and 2012, and winning a stage of the [[Tour of Missouri]] in 2008. He announced his retirement in September 2012, stating that the [[2012 Tour of Beijing]] would be his last race.<ref name=\"retirement\"/> He is also an author who has written three books.\n\n==Career==\nHe was born and raised in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. His father, Michael (Mike) Barry Sr., was a racer himself in England in the 1950s, who until 2006 ran a specialty bike store and manufactured a line of hand-made bicycle frames under his own Mariposa<ref>[http://www.mariposabicycles.ca/about Mariposa]</ref> brand. As a result, the younger Barry grew up in a cycling-intense environment, and started racing at a very young age. He has been a professional since 1998. He has spent many years on the Canadian National Team during the early years of his career. His wife is 2004 Olympic Silver Medalist [[Dede Demet Barry]]. They have 2 children.\n\nPrevious to riding for [[UCI ProTour]] team {{ct|SKY|2012}} Barry spent several years with the {{ct|DSC|2006}} team. He also raced with the [[Saturn Cycling Team]] for a number of years before going to US Postal Service/Discovery.\n\nBarry has raced in 5 [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]s and 5 [[Giro d'Italia]]s but in 2007 had to abandon the Giro due to health issues, which put him out most of the season. He also had to pull out of the [[2002 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] after colliding with a motorcycle on the eight stage.<ref name=\"confession\">{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/Canadian+cyclist+Barry+admits+doping+part+Armstrong+investigation/7369282/story.html|title=Canadian cyclist Barry admits to doping, says he gave in to pressure to succeed|work=Canadian Press|publisher=2010\u20132012 Postmedia Network Inc.|date=10 October 2010|accessdate=22 October 2012|author=Neil Davidson}}.</ref>\n\nIn 2005 he wrote the book: ''Inside the Postal Bus'', about his experiences at {{ct|USP}} and the 2004 season whilst riding in support of [[Lance Armstrong]].<ref name=\"confession\"/> The work contains texts authored by some of his team mates, including [[George Hincapie]].

His third book, ''Le Metier'', detailing the life of a cycling domestique, was published in 2010 by Rouleur.\n\nHe is generally considered a support rider, or [[cycling domestique|domestique]], helping the team leaders win races, but he will often get the opportunity to go for personal results.
