It was shortly after this return to Southern California that Avalon met [[Simon Rex]] and began to gain recognition for his music.<ref name=\"mickeyavalon.com\"/>\n\n==Street art==\nAvalon is a member of the Los Angeles-based [[graffiti]] [[Graffiti terminology#crew|crew]] CBS (Can't Be Stopped / City Bomb Squad).\n\n==Personal life==\nAvalon has two younger half-brothers (who are identical twins). He has helped them relocate to the [[Los Angeles]] area and enter the music industry.<ref>http://mickeyavalon.bandcamp.com/track/mickey-avalon-interview-1</ref>\n\nMickey Avalon was the main investor in a series of self-named apartment complexes in Camarillo, California and Sunnyvale, California.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Style==\nAcross the majority of Avalon's work, recurring themes of hard drug use are seen, particularly in reference to his consumption of [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]],<ref name=\"phoenixnewtimes.com\"/> an unusual style in [[hip hop]], where the artist more commonly refers to the sale of such substances. Another popular theme in Avalon's music is his seduction, and sexual encounters with women. This is coupled with his overly sexualized image, often performing with heavy eye makeup and no shirt.\n\n==Career==\nUpon moving to Los Angeles, he was befriended by ex-[[MTV VJ]] [[Simon Rex]] who encouraged Avalon to rap and collaborated with him. The two began passing out demos to Hollywood clubs and soon developed a following among fans of the Santa Cruz nightclub scene.\n\nUpon entering the rap scene in 2000, Avalon first adopted the stage name, \"The Relevant\" and made his first appearance on Met Fly (who would later be known as Andre Legacy)'s album entitled \"Wiggin' Out\".  In 2004, Avalon first collaborated with Existereo of the [[Shape Shifters (band)|Shape Shifters]]'s on the song \"No Class.\" He later collaborated with Existereo again on: \"Couple o'Shitbags & The Fly's That Go With 'em\" (2005), \"Wrong Side\" (2006), \"I Love Who\" (2007).\n\nIn November 2006, Mickey Avalon released his self-titled debut solo album. Released through Interscope/Shoot to Kill Records in association with MySpace Records, the album spawned the singles \"Jane Fonda\" and \"Mr. Right\". In January 2007, Avalon contributed lyrics and vocals on [[Unwritten Law]]'s \"Shoulda Known Better.\" That same year, he was featured in a [[Boost Mobile]] rap commercial with fellow rappers [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Young Jeezy]].\n\nIn 2011, after years of back and forth wrangling with Interscope, Mickey was released from his recording contract. He is currently signed to [[Suburban Noize Records]]. On March 12, 2012 he digitally released a 4-track EP entitled ''On the Ave''. His second solo album, ''Loaded'' was released on April 24, 2012.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, Mickey Avalon released a 5 track EP titled I Get Even Even, and then later released a music video for the track Hollywood (feat. [[Paul Oakenfold]]).\n\nThree years later on November 25, 2016, he announced that his third album, Teardrops on My Tombstone would be available on Valentine's Day 2017.\n\n===Dyslexic Speedreaders===\nAfter Mickey became close friends with [[Simon Rex]], they formed a rap group called the Dyslexic Speedreaders. The group included: Mickey Avalon, Simon \"Dirt Nasty\" Rex, Andre Legacy, and Beardo as the four members. Andre Legacy was Avalon's friend since elementary school and Beardo was Avalon's friend from their work together in the modelling industry. In 2004, the Dyslexic Speedreaders released their first album which was entitled ''Catching Up To Wilt''. In 2007, the Dyslexic Speedreaders collaborated with the [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]] and Luckiam on the song, \"Nevermind.\" In 2008, the Dyslexic Speedreaders released the Shoot To Kill Mixtape. In 2009, Mickey Avalon released \"What Do You Say?\" which was also part of ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' soundtrack and featured Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy. However, Avalon announced through his Myspace page that this would be the last song that the Dyslexic Speedreaders would release.\n\nAfter years of friendship and musical collaborations, the group disbanded after Mickey had a dispute with the other members over unpaid loans. On November 7, 2010, Avalon announced on theFIVE10 Radio that he was leaving his label and that his relationship with Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy had been strained due to money issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefive10.squarespace.com/show-archive/2010/11/8/mickey-avalon-drops-a-bombshell-on-thefive10-radio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124155340/http://thefive10.squarespace.com/show-archive/2010/11/8/mickey-avalon-drops-a-bombshell-on-thefive10-radio.html |archivedate=2010-11-24 }}</ref> He told JC of theFIVE10 Radio that Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy never paid him back for all the money he had put into developing them and that was the reason they were not talking. He stated that there was still room for reconciliation by saying, \"No one slept with anyone's chick.\" Dirt Nasty is reported to have responded to Avalon's comment, stating \"Well I know that Avalon didn't sleep with ANY chicks, because everyone knows that he prefers dick.\"\n\nDuring his July 31, 2011 interview on Stefanie's Rock Show, Avalon stated that he briefly reunited with the Dyslexic Speedreaders for an unplanned one time performance. He attended the Roxy with his daughter while Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy were scheduled to perform that night. During the course of the show, Avalon accepted an invitation to perform on stage with his former bandmates. He said he is open to the possibility of future reunions. In November 2015, Mickey Avalon and Dirt Nasty officially reconciled by releasing a 5-song collaborative EP entitled \"Married to the Game\".\n\n==Controversy==\nIn March 2007, Avalon was booed off the stage while opening for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], in [[Oklahoma City]]. The next day, Red Hot Chili Peppers lead guitarist [[John Frusciante]] wrote a letter to the band's fans in Oklahoma City, accusing them of booing Avalon for personal issues, and having a lack of \"regard for humanity.\"<ref name= \"Invisible Movement\">[http://invisible-movement.net/press/2007-to-oklahoma-audience Letter from John Frusciante to RHCP's Oklahoma City fans regarding Mickey Avalon.] Published 3/13/2007.</ref>\n\n==Tours==\n* \"Stroke Me Tour\" (2009) (Feat.

It was shortly after this return to Southern California that Avalon met [[Simon Rex]] and began to gain recognition for his music.<ref name=\"mickeyavalon.com\"/>\n\n==Street art==\nAvalon is a member of the Los Angeles-based [[graffiti]] [[Graffiti terminology#crew|crew]] CBS (Can't Be Stopped / City Bomb Squad).\n\n==Personal life==\nAvalon has two younger half-brothers (who are identical twins). He has helped them relocate to the [[Los Angeles]] area and enter the music industry.<ref>http://mickeyavalon.bandcamp.com/track/mickey-avalon-interview-1</ref>\n\nMickey Avalon was the main investor in a series of self-named apartment complexes in Camarillo, California and Sunnyvale, California.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Style==\nAcross the majority of Avalon's work, recurring themes of hard drug use are seen, particularly in reference to his consumption of [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]],<ref name=\"phoenixnewtimes.com\"/> an unusual style in [[hip hop]], where the artist more commonly refers to the sale of such substances. Another popular theme in Avalon's music is his seduction, and sexual encounters with women. This is coupled with his overly sexualized image, often performing with heavy eye makeup and no shirt.\n\n==Career==\nUpon moving to Los Angeles, he was befriended by ex-[[MTV VJ]] [[Simon Rex]] who encouraged Avalon to rap and collaborated with him. The two began passing out demos to Hollywood clubs and soon developed a following among fans of the Santa Cruz nightclub scene.\n\nUpon entering the rap scene in 2000, Avalon first adopted the stage name, \"The Relevant\" and made his first appearance on Met Fly (who would later be known as Andre Legacy)'s album entitled \"Wiggin' Out\".  In 2004, Avalon first collaborated with Existereo of the [[Shape Shifters (band)|Shape Shifters]]'s on the song \"No Class.\" He later collaborated with Existereo again on: \"Couple o'Shitbags & The Fly's That Go With 'em\" (2005), \"Wrong Side\" (2006), \"I Love Who\" (2007).\n\nIn November 2006, Mickey Avalon released his self-titled debut solo album. Released through Interscope/Shoot to Kill Records in association with MySpace Records, the album spawned the singles \"Jane Fonda\" and \"Mr. Right\". In January 2007, Avalon contributed lyrics and vocals on [[Unwritten Law]]'s \"Shoulda Known Better.\" That same year, he was featured in a [[Boost Mobile]] rap commercial with fellow rappers [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Young Jeezy]].\n\nIn 2011, after years of back and forth wrangling with Interscope, Mickey was released from his recording contract. He is currently signed to [[Suburban Noize Records]]. On March 12, 2012 he digitally released a 4-track EP entitled ''On the Ave''. His second solo album, ''Loaded'' was released on April 24, 2012.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, Mickey Avalon released a 5 track EP titled I Get Even Even, and then later released a music video for the track Hollywood (feat. [[Paul Oakenfold]]).\n\nThree years later on November 25, 2016, he announced that his third album, Teardrops on My Tombstone would be available on Valentine's Day 2017.\n\n===Dyslexic Speedreaders===\nAfter Mickey became close friends with [[Simon Rex]], they formed a rap group called the Dyslexic Speedreaders. The group included: Mickey Avalon, Simon \"Dirt Nasty\" Rex, Andre Legacy, and Beardo as the four members. Andre Legacy was Avalon's friend since elementary school and Beardo was Avalon's friend from their work together in the modelling industry. In 2004, the Dyslexic Speedreaders released their first album which was entitled ''Catching Up To Wilt''. In 2007, the Dyslexic Speedreaders collaborated with the [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]] and Luckiam on the song, \"Nevermind.\" In 2008, the Dyslexic Speedreaders released the Shoot To Kill Mixtape. In 2009, Mickey Avalon released \"What Do You Say?\" which was also part of ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' soundtrack and featured Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy. However, Avalon announced through his Myspace page that this would be the last song that the Dyslexic Speedreaders would release.\n\nAfter years of friendship and musical collaborations, the group disbanded after Mickey had a dispute with the other members over unpaid loans. On November 7, 2010, Avalon announced on theFIVE10 Radio that he was leaving his label and that his relationship with Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy had been strained due to money issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefive10.squarespace.com/show-archive/2010/11/8/mickey-avalon-drops-a-bombshell-on-thefive10-radio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124155340/http://thefive10.squarespace.com/show-archive/2010/11/8/mickey-avalon-drops-a-bombshell-on-thefive10-radio.html |archivedate=2010-11-24 }}</ref> He told JC of theFIVE10 Radio that Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy never paid him back for all the money he had put into developing them and that was the reason they were not talking. He stated that there was still room for reconciliation by saying, \"No one slept with anyone's chick.\" Dirt Nasty is reported to have responded to Avalon's comment, stating \"Well I know that Avalon didn't sleep with ANY chicks, because everyone knows that he prefers dick.\"\n\nDuring his July 31, 2011 interview on Stefanie's Rock Show, Avalon stated that he briefly reunited with the Dyslexic Speedreaders for an unplanned one time performance. He attended the Roxy with his daughter while Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy were scheduled to perform that night. During the course of the show, Avalon accepted an invitation to perform on stage with his former bandmates. He said he is open to the possibility of future reunions. In November 2015, Mickey Avalon and Dirt Nasty officially reconciled by releasing a 5-song collaborative EP entitled \"Married to the Game\".\n\n==Controversy==\nIn March 2007, Avalon was booed off the stage while opening for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], in [[Oklahoma City]]. The next day, Red Hot Chili Peppers lead guitarist [[John Frusciante]] wrote a letter to the band's fans in Oklahoma City, accusing them of booing Avalon for personal issues, and having a lack of \"regard for humanity.\"<ref name= \"Invisible Movement\">[http://invisible-movement.net/press/2007-to-oklahoma-audience Letter from John Frusciante to RHCP's Oklahoma City fans regarding Mickey Avalon.] Published 3/13/2007.</ref>\n\n==Tours==\n* \"Stroke Me Tour\" (2009) (Feat.

The immediate reaction was citizens and the city clamoring to build an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity.  This had already been tried following the 1890 flood&mdash;the result was the \"Long Wooden Bridge\" that connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz in Dallas, but the resulting unstable bridge was easily washed away by the 1908 flood.  [[George Dealey|George B.
