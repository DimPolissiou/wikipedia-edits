It was originally created by [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], at the time a division of [[Warner Communications]] and the original owner of [[MTV]], and launched on January 1, 1985, in the former space of [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s short-lived [[Cable Music Channel]].\n\nThe channel was originally conceived to build upon the success of sister channel MTV by playing [[music videos]] targeting a slightly older demographic than MTV by focusing on the lighter, softer side of [[popular music]].<ref name=launsch>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=11xOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5661%2C1204403 |work=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=''(New York Times)'' |last=Sherwood |first=Rick |title=VH-1 wants adult video viewers|date=October 5, 1984 |page=11}}</ref> Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music videos and into [[reality television]] programming, albeit with a focus on music personalities and celebrities, and shows targeting female audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as ''[[Behind the Music]]'', the ''[[I Love...#VH1 series|I Love\u2026]]'' series, the ''[[VH1#Celebreality|Celebreality]]'' block,  ''[[Love & Hip Hop]]'', and [[Wild 'n Out]].\n\nAs of January 2016, approximately 90.2 million [[United States|US]] households receive VH1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history (1985\u20131994)===\n====Format and VJs (1985\u201389)====\n[[File:VH-1.svg|thumb|150px|right|The first VH1 logo used from 1985 to 1988 in the USA; between 1995\u20132002 in Germany and 1993\u20131999 in the UK/Ireland.

Also frequently featured in the network's early years were \"videos\" for [[Motown Records|Motown]] and other 60s [[oldies]] consisting of [[newsreel]] and concert footage. It was introduced on January 1, 1985, with the video performance of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" by [[Marvin Gaye]]<ref name=\"b and c\"/>, who died a year before the network launched (the national anthem was also played at the launch of Cable Music Channel).\n\nFrom the start, Video Hits One was branded as an urban version of its sister/parent channel. It played more jazz and R&B artists than MTV and had a higher rotation of urban-contemporary performers. Its early on-camera personalities were New York radio veterans [[Don Imus]] (then of [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]]), [[Frankie Crocker]] (then program director and DJ for [[WBLS]]), [[Scott Shannon]] (of [[WHTZ]]), [[Jon Bauman]] (\"Bowzer\" from [[Sha Na Na]]), [[Bobby Rivers]], and [[Rita Coolidge]].\n\nLater VJs included Tim Byrd of [[WFAN-FM|WPIX-FM]] (the current day FM rebroadcast of [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]]), a station whose eclectic ballad-and-R&B oriented format mirrored that of VH-1, and [[Alison Steele]] (\"The Nightbird\" of [[WNEW-FM]]). [[Rosie O'Donnell]] later joined the outlet's veejay lineup. O'Donnell would also host a comedy show featuring various comedians each episode. As an added touch to make the network more like a televised radio station, the early years of the network featured jingles in their bumpers produced by [[JAM Creative Productions]] in Dallas, who had previously made jingles for radio stations worldwide.\n\nThe format left room for occasional ad-libs by the VJ, a godsend for emcees such as Imus and O'Donnell. In true Imus style, he used a 1985 segment of his VH-1 show to jokingly call smooth-jazz icon [[Sade Adu]] a \"grape\" for her oval-shaped head.\n\nTypical of VH1's very early programming was ''New Visions'', a series which featured videos and in-studio performances by [[smooth jazz]] and classical and [[New-age music|new-age]] bands and performers, including [[Spyro Gyra]], [[Andy Narell]], [[Mark Isham]], [[Philip Glass]],<ref>{{youtube|tye8bHjPRUU|\"Opening\" by Philip Glass on VH-1's 'New Visions'}}</ref> and [[Yanni]]. At first many different musicians guest-hosted the program, but eventually musician/songwriter [[Ben Sidran]] became the permanent host.\n\nNew Age music videos continued to play on the channel into the 1990s. They would be seen on the Sunday morning two-hour music video block titled ''Sunday Brunch''.\n\n====VH1 Corvette Give-away Sweepstakes====\nIn order to reach a wider and younger audience, VH1 announced in late 1989 that in 1990 they would be holding a contest where the grand prize was a collection of 36 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s, one for every model year from its introduction year of 1953, to the then current model year of 1989 (there is no model for 1983), all going to a single grand winner. All cars were to be certified as roadworthy and in \"good\" to \"excellent\" condition. The collection at the time had an estimated worth of over {{US$}}1 million. Contestants entered by calling a 900 number and registering, at $2 per call. VH1 received over 4 million call-in entries. The winner was a man from Long Island, New York, who immediately sold the entire collection to artist [[Peter Max]] for $500,000. Max intended to use the cars for an art project, but it never got started and the entire collection was left in an underground parking lot in New York City for over 20 years, and deteriorated into poor condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year-256039|title=vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year|publisher=autotrader.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://roadtrippers.com/stories/max-corvettes|title=max-corvettes|publisher=roadtrippers.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://corvetteheroes.com/|title=vh1 corvette giveaway|publisher=corvetteheroes.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/peter-max-s-forgotten-corvette-collection-emerges-from-the-dust-after-25-years-162558587.html|title=Forgotten Corvette collection emerges from the dust after 25 years|date=23 December 2014|work=Yahoo Autos|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://restomods.com/forgotten-corvette-collection-rediscovered-256/|title=Long Forgotten Corvette Collection Rediscovered|work=Restomods.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''VH1: Music First'' (1994\u20132003)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2008}}\n[[File:VH1 94-2003 logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The third VH1 logo used from 1994 to 2003.

The success of A to Z led to a weeknight 11 p.m. hour-long broadcast of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] videos, titled ''The Madonna Show''. The videos were aired without introduction by a VJ and the program was soon shortened to thirty minutes, and then scrapped altogether. By 1996, VH1 was heading down the same path as its sister channel, MTV, choosing to focus more on music-related shows than on music videos. Additionally, the network began to expand its playlist of music videos to include more rock music.<ref name=\"b and c\"/> Old episodes of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' could regularly be seen on the channel. By that time, the channel's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were beginning to fall.\n\n====''Video Countdown''====\nAs part of VH-1's re-branding as \"VH1: Music First\" in 1994, the channel launched a new series, the ''VH1 Top 10 Countdown'', that counted down the top 10 music videos played on VH1 each week. A combination of record sales, radio airplay, video spins, [[Internet forum|message board]] posts, and [[Mail|conventional mail]] would decide the order of the countdown. A rotating cast of [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] picked up hosting duties for the show over the years. The series expanded from 10 to 20 music videos, becoming the ''[[VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown]]'', in 2001. The show was renamed ''The 20'' in early 2015, and ended later that year.\n\n====''Pop-Up Video''====\nIn the fall of 1996, VH1 premiered ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'', in which music videos were accompanied by \"pop-ups\" (also known as \"bubbles\" or \"info nuggets\")\u2014small enclosed areas of the screen containing facts about the band artists, and videos such as career highlights, discography, biographical details, quotes, and anecdotes. For a time, this was VH1's highest rated show.\n\n====''VH1 Storytellers''====\n{{main|VH1 Storytellers}}\nIn February 1996, VH1 again hit it big with the premiere of the first of the network's flagship shows, ''VH1 Storytellers''. The show started with a broadcast of [[Ray Davies]], during his \"Storyteller\" tour, and took its name from this first show. In each hourlong episode, artists appear in front of a (mostly small and intimate) live audience, interspersing musical performances with anecdotes related to the songs' meaning, the songwriting process, audience reaction, etc. Along with Davies, the series has featured a widely diverse list of artists, including [[Culture Club]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Johnny Cash]], [[Kanye West]], [[Tom Waits]], and [[Def Leppard]]. [[Meat Loaf]] enjoyed the show's format so much that he bought the stage decorations from VH-1 and went on to do a \"Storytellers\" tour in 1998/1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|publisher=livedaily.com|title=Meat Loaf's \"Storytellers\" Tour Extended Through January|date=7 December 1999|accessdate=27 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044055/http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|archive-date=May 17, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====''Behind the Music''====\n{{main|Behind the Music}}\nVH1 scored another hit in August 1997 with the debut of ''Behind the Music''. The hourlong show features interviews and biographies of some of popular music's biggest stars qualified to be profiled on the series. The premiere episode featured [[Milli Vanilli]]. Episodes have ranged from [[Aaliyah]] to [[Stryper]] to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], as well as others such as, [[Meat Loaf]], [[Tori Amos]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Cher]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[TLC (music)|TLC]], [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], [[Megadeth]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Selena]], [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Pantera]], and [[Eminem]], with more episodes being produced periodically. By the late 1990s, the show began to run out of artists to profile, leading to the short-lived ''BTM2'' program, half-hour looks into bands and artists whose popularity was rising, but not yet at its peak.\n\n====''Legends''====\n{{Main|VH1's Legends}}\nShortly after, VH1 created a companion series, ''[[VH1's Legends|Legends]]'' (originally sponsored by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]), profiling artists who have made a more significant contribution to music history to qualify as \"Legends\" (that is, those artists who have gone beyond the category of ''Behind the Music'' biographies). The artists profiled so far have included <!--KEEP IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->[[Aerosmith]]; the [[Bee Gees]]; [[David Bowie]]; [[Johnny Cash]]; [[Eric Clapton]]; [[The Clash]]; [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]; [[Sam Cooke]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]; [[The Doors]]; [[John Fogerty]]; [[Aretha Franklin]]; [[Marvin Gaye]]; [[The Grateful Dead]]; [[Guns N' Roses]]; [[Jimi Hendrix]]; [[Michael Jackson]]; [[Eminem]]; [[Elton John]]; [[Janis Joplin]]; [[B.

Founded in 1997, VH1 Save The Music was the first organization in existence dedicated to restoring music programs in America's schools. For nearly 20 years, the foundation has donated over $53 million worth of new musical instruments to 2,024 public schools in 247 school districts around the country to date\u2014impacting the lives of more than three{{nbsp}}million public school students.

Also in 1999, [[Donna Summer]] who was asked to do the \"diva\" concert, was given her own concert special by VH1 \"Donna Summer Live and More: Encore\". Some female artists such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Cher]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Faith Hill]] were featured in two or more VH1 divas concerts, with [[Cyndi Lauper]] appearing the most times, having been featured in four concerts. In 2000, [[Diana Ross]], who has been asked several times to appear on previous editions, appeared in her own edition of the special, \"VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute To Diana Ross\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRmhiwuwvzY</ref>\n\n====''Movies That Rock''====\nIn 1999, VH1 aired its first original movie, a biopic on [[Sweetwater (band)|Sweetwater]]. Their third original movie (which aired in 2000), ''[[Two of Us (2000 television)|Two of Us]]'', focused on a fictional meeting between [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Over the next three years, they made over a dozen movies, including bio-pics on [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Doors]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[MC Hammer]], [[The Monkees]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Def Leppard]].\n\nVH1 continues to air \"Movies That Rock\" on a regular basis, expanding to include movies not produced by VH1. The subject matter remains mostly focused on music and musicians.\n\n====Diversification====\nIn the late 1990s, VH1 continued to get more diverse and teen-based with its music selection, and with that, the network updated its 1994 \"Big 1\" logo. Various late-night rock shows have been shown on VH1, featuring [[alternative rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] videos from the 1980s and 1990s. VH1 eventually warmed up to harder rock acts such as the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], the [[Foo Fighters]], the [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Metallica]]. Their new videos began being added into VH1's playlist right away.\n\nAround late 2002, VH1 even began to play mainstream [[hip hop music|rap]] musicians.<ref name=\"b and c\"/> The latest videos by [[Eminem]], [[Nelly]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] began to be shown in VH1's rotation and even started to cut up on VH1's top 20 countdown. VH1 also plays music from Latin artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Shakira]].\n\n====Other past trends====\n''rockDocs'' was the title under which VH1 aired various [[rockumentary|music documentaries]], both those produced by VH1 and those produced by third parties. Such documentary series produced by VH1 include \"''And Ya' Don't Stop''\", a five-part series on the history of hip-hop and rap,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925111.html?categoryid=32&cs=1|title = And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip Hop|publisher = Variety | date = 3 October 2004|author = Phil Gallo}}</ref> a four-part series on the history of heavy metal, ''[[Heavy: The Story of Metal]]'', and ''[[The Drug Years]]'', which tells the story of various drug cultures that changed America. Films produced by other studios have also been aired as ''rockDocs'', including ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare]]'', ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'', ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', ''[[Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!]]'', a documentary on the [[Beastie Boys]], and most recently ''[[Last Days of Left Eye]]'' which documented the last month of [[Lisa Lopes]]'s life from the band [[TLC (band)|TLC]], and ''N.W.A.: The World's Most Dangerous Group,'' featuring the narration of comedian [[Chris Rock]], which chronicled the rise and fall of [[N.W.A]].\n\nVH1 endured criticism for ''Music Behind Bars'', which mainly focuses on musicians in custody. Critics have claimed prisoners, mainly those convicted of murder, should not be entitled to any exposure, especially nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/1712084/detail.html|title=Philadelphia News, Local News, Weather, Traffic, and Breaking News|work=NBC 10 Philadelphia|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe channel aired ''[[Where Are They Now? (VH1 TV series)|Where Are They Now?]]'' from 1999 to 2002. It featured former celebrities and their current professional and personal status. Each episode was dedicated to a specific genre, ranging from past child stars to [[Aaron Spelling#Notable productions|Aaron Spelling's notable productions]], to controversial news figures.\n\nVH1 also aired a series of spots in 2003, featuring animated kittens from the online animation website Rathergood, lipsyncing popular songs such as [[Joan Jett]]'s \"[[I Love Rock n' Roll]]\", [[Culture Club]]'s \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\" and [[Guns N' Roses]]' \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\". These spots were done by British animator [[Joel Veitch]].\n\n===Box logo era (2003\u20132013)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VH1 logo.svg|thumbnail|150px|The fourth VH1 logo used from 2003 to 2013.

Having saturated its ''Behind The Music'' series (and spinoff ''BTM2'', a 30-minute version that told the stories of current chart-toppers), gotten past the point of showing music videos on a regular basis, the network began to target the pop culture nostalgia market.<ref name=\"b and c\"/><ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Bryan|title=VH1: The Surreal Network|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136882/|work=Slate|date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=February 24, 2006}}</ref> Following the controversy over the murder-suicide of a contestant from ''[[Megan Wants a Millionaire]]'', the channel toned down its reality programming.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Business/Financial Desk; SECTB - With 'Celebreality,' VH1 attracts ratings and chagrin| first = Brian | last = Stelter  | page = 5 | date = 31 August 2009 | accessdate = September 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/business/media/31cable.html?_r=3&fta=y&pagewanted=all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | title =  Music Index&nbsp;\u2013 Top Story 1 - VH1 revamps programming| date = 18 April 2010 | accessdate = September 26, 2010 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec3c2452ddf8270c14cd59b8ec1ea302| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130125170346/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec3c2452ddf8270c14cd59b8ec1ea302| url-status = dead| archive-date = January 25, 2013}}</ref> On July 1, 2007, VH1 and [[MTV Live (TV network)|MHD]] simulcast the entire ''Concert for Diana'' live from London, England, on the birthday of [[Princess Diana]], [[Princess of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/events/concerts/diana/|title=Watch Video of the Concert for Diana On-Demand - View Individual Performances Online - See Photos from the Concert for Princess Diana - VH1.com|work=vh1.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nVH1 would continue to air its music video blocks despite its decreasing reliance on such programming. Their main program block was seen from 3 a.m to 11 a.m ET. The overnight block was called ''Insomniac Music Theater'', later renamed ''Nocturnal State'' in August 2005. At of the beginning of October 2008, ''Nocturnal State'' was cut down to one hour, and ''Fresh: New Music'' was supplanted by additional hours of ''Jump Start''. In 2010, VH1 retired ''Nocturnal State''. Music Videos continued to be branded under ''Jump Start'' until January 5, 2013.\n\n====''I Love\u2026'' series (2002\u20132014)====\n{{further|I Love...#VH1 series}}\nIn 2002, VH1 broadcast a ten-part series entitled ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]''. The series was adapted from a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] series, first broadcast in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/|title=BBC Two - I Love the 1970s|work=BBC|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's ''I Love the '80s'', coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from [[2003 in television|2003's]] ''[[I Love the '70s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '70s]]'', to further variants like ''[[I Love the '80s Strikes Back]]'', ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'', and ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. More recently, VH1 premiered ''[[I Love the '80s 3-D]]'' and ''[[I Love the '70s: Volume 2]]''. So eager was the network to capitalize on the trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, despite the fact that the decade had not yet ended (''[[I Love the New Millennium]]'', broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000\u20132007). This was thought to be the final installment of the series until 2014, when ''[[I Love the 2000s]]'' continued the format.\n\nThe concept was broadened to include non-decade based installments, ''[[I Love the Holidays]]'' and ''[[I Love Toys]]''. The format of these shows has also been repeated for the weekly program ''[[Best Week Ever]]''.\n\n====''The Greatest'' series====\nVH1 also produces its ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|The Greatest]]'' series in which a similar format is used to countdown lists like ''\"100 Greatest Artists of Rock and Roll\"'', ''\"The 50 Sexiest Video Moments\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Songs of Rock 'N' Roll\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Songs from the Past 25 Years\"'', ''\"100 Greatest One-hit Wonders\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Kid Stars\"'', and ''\"100 Greatest Teen Stars\"''.

The term appears to have been coined by Michael Gross, writing for The Toronto Star on May 12, 1991. In his article, entitled \"Celebrity's New Face,\" Mr. Gross used a hyphenated form of the word (\"celeb-reality\") to describe the tendency of certain contemporary celebrities to downplay the traditional trappings of [[Hollywood glamour]]. \"You could see the new celeb-reality on display at this year's Oscars,\" wrote Gross. \"It is Kathy Bates and Whoopi Goldberg, not Kim Basinger and Michelle Pfeiffer. It is Jeremy Irons in black tie and the sneakers he says keep his feet on the ground. It is Kevin Costner, fighting small, important battles, winning big, but reacting with modesty and going off to party privately. The new celebrities are human first, famous second.\"\n\nThe next known citation of the word is by Joyce Millman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 5, 2003. In an article entitled, \"Celebreality: The 'Stars' Are Elbowing Their Way In,\" Ms. Millman wrote: \"Celebreality, the junk genre du jour, turns the notion of reality TV upside down. Instead of real people acting like celebrities on shows like \"Survivor\", \"Big Brother\" and \"The Bachelor\", celebreality gives us celebrities acting like real people on shows like \"The Osbournes\", \"The Anna Nicole Show\" and \"Celebrity Boot Camp.\" I'm using the term \"celebrity\" loosely here\u2014we're not talking about Russell Crowe, Julia Roberts and Dame Judi Dench eating bugs and scrubbing latrines. No, the celebrities of celebreality are a motlier crew, like, well, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Vince Neil, the former rap superstar M. C. Hammer and the wee ex-Michael Jackson ornament Emmanuel (\"Webster\") Lewis. Those three will be setting up housekeeping together on Thursday in \"The Surreal Life\" on WB, a celebreality spin on MTV's \"Real World.\" Not to be outdone, ABC sends a Baldwin brother (Stephen), a supermodel (Frederique) and a former \"L.A. Law\" star (Corbin Bernsen) to Hawaii for \"Celebrity Mole Hawaii\", beginning Wednesday.\"\n\nThe VH1 Celebreality block has also aired shows such as:\n*2003: ''[[Surviving Nugent]]'' sent eight individuals to [[Ted Nugent]]'s house to compete in various games and activities.

Also frequently featured in the network's early years were \"videos\" for [[Motown Records|Motown]] and other 60s [[oldies]] consisting of [[newsreel]] and concert footage. It was introduced on January 1, 1985, with the video performance of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" by [[Marvin Gaye]]<ref name=\"b and c\"/>, who died a year before the network launched (the national anthem was also played at the launch of Cable Music Channel).\n\nFrom the start, Video Hits One was branded as an urban version of its sister/parent channel. It played more jazz and R&B artists than MTV and had a higher rotation of urban-contemporary performers. Its early on-camera personalities were New York radio veterans [[Don Imus]] (then of [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]]), [[Frankie Crocker]] (then program director and DJ for [[WBLS]]), [[Scott Shannon]] (of [[WHTZ]]), [[Jon Bauman]] (\"Bowzer\" from [[Sha Na Na]]), [[Bobby Rivers]], and [[Rita Coolidge]].\n\nLater VJs included Tim Byrd of [[WFAN-FM|WPIX-FM]] (the current day FM rebroadcast of [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]]), a station whose eclectic ballad-and-R&B oriented format mirrored that of VH-1, and [[Alison Steele]] (\"The Nightbird\" of [[WNEW-FM]]). [[Rosie O'Donnell]] later joined the outlet's veejay lineup. O'Donnell would also host a comedy show featuring various comedians each episode. As an added touch to make the network more like a televised radio station, the early years of the network featured jingles in their bumpers produced by [[JAM Creative Productions]] in Dallas, who had previously made jingles for radio stations worldwide.\n\nThe format left room for occasional ad-libs by the VJ, a godsend for emcees such as Imus and O'Donnell. In true Imus style, he used a 1985 segment of his VH-1 show to jokingly call smooth-jazz icon [[Sade Adu]] a \"grape\" for her oval-shaped head.\n\nTypical of VH1's very early programming was ''New Visions'', a series which featured videos and in-studio performances by [[smooth jazz]] and classical and [[New-age music|new-age]] bands and performers, including [[Spyro Gyra]], [[Andy Narell]], [[Mark Isham]], [[Philip Glass]],<ref>{{youtube|tye8bHjPRUU|\"Opening\" by Philip Glass on VH-1's 'New Visions'}}</ref> and [[Yanni]]. At first many different musicians guest-hosted the program, but eventually musician/songwriter [[Ben Sidran]] became the permanent host.\n\nNew Age music videos continued to play on the channel into the 1990s. They would be seen on the Sunday morning two-hour music video block titled ''Sunday Brunch''.\n\n====Early programming (1989\u20131994)====\nOnce VH1 established itself a few years later, they catered to Top 40, [[adult contemporary]], [[classic rock]], and 1980s mainstream pop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NPYAxnuVgc |title=1991 VH1 Commercials |website=YouTube |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> For a time, even country music videos aired in a one-hour block during the afternoons. They started out using MTV's famous [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]] typeface font for their music video credit tags. It was later replaced in 1991 by a larger font, with the year the video was made added to the lower column that identified the label on which the album was released. In 1993, the name of the videos' director was included at the bottom of the credits.\n\nDuring this time, they also had some non-music programming, such as a comedy hour hosted by [[Rosie O'Donnell]] with various amateur and veteran comedians, called ''Stand Up Spotlight'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3cp0qg7go |title=Stand Up Spotlight \u2013 Robert G.

One popular weekend program was called ''Video Rewind'', in which blocks of 1980s videos from one particular year would play for an hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WjmqbFeVzA|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> There was also a short-lived hour-long program called ''By Request'' in which viewers could call a 1\u2013900 hotline number to request their videos.\n\nAlso in 1991, a popular morning program was introduced called ''Hits News & Weather'' that ran from 7 AM to 9 AM ET.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QseEyA2O_rA |title=VH1 1991 |website=YouTube |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> (It later expanded to 10 AM ET.) It composed of music videos both past and present along with a 90-second update of the day's news & weather provided by [[All News Channel]]. The updates were typically shown twice an hour during the program. A box displaying the minutes past the hour was shown below the logo during the period. It was discontinued a week before the channel was re-branded in the Spring of 1994. During the week prior, classic music videos from forgotten artists/bands aired, titled ''Whatever Happened To...?''\n\nThe channel's playlist was gradually expanding, and, by 1994, included contemporary musicians such as [[Ace of Base]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Amy Grant]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], and other slightly heavier, or more [[alternative rock]]-influenced music than what it had originally played, although favorites such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Cher]], [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Celine Dion|C\u00e9line Dion]] still continued to receive heavy play for several more years as well. VH1 to One was a program in the Video Hits One days that was very similar to Behind The Music. It profiled artists such as Phil Colins, Michael Bolton and Paul McCartney. Plus other various artists of interest at the time that were playing the network's chosen style of music at the time and their music careers\n\n====VH1 Corvette Give-away Sweepstakes====\nIn order to reach a wider and younger audience, VH1 announced in late 1989 that in 1990 they would be holding a contest where the grand prize was a collection of 36 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s, one for every model year from its introduction year of 1953, to the then current model year of 1989 (there is no model for 1983), all going to a single grand winner. All cars were to be certified as roadworthy and in \"good\" to \"excellent\" condition. The collection at the time had an estimated worth of over {{US$}}1 million. Contestants entered by calling a 900 number and registering, at $2 per call. VH1 received over 4 million call-in entries. The winner was a man from Long Island, New York, who immediately sold the entire collection to artist [[Peter Max]] for $500,000. Max intended to use the cars for an art project, but it never got started and the entire collection was left in an underground parking lot in New York City for over 20 years, and deteriorated into poor condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year-256039|title=vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year|publisher=autotrader.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://roadtrippers.com/stories/max-corvettes|title=max-corvettes|publisher=roadtrippers.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://corvetteheroes.com/|title=vh1 corvette giveaway|publisher=corvetteheroes.com|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/peter-max-s-forgotten-corvette-collection-emerges-from-the-dust-after-25-years-162558587.html|title=Forgotten Corvette collection emerges from the dust after 25 years|date=23 December 2014|work=Yahoo Autos|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://restomods.com/forgotten-corvette-collection-rediscovered-256/|title=Long Forgotten Corvette Collection Rediscovered|work=Restomods.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''VH1: Music First'' (1994\u20132003)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2008}}\n[[File:VH1 94-2003 logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The third VH1 logo used from 1994 to 2003.

The success of A to Z led to a weeknight 11 p.m. hour-long broadcast of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] videos, titled ''The Madonna Show''. The videos were aired without introduction by a VJ and the program was soon shortened to thirty minutes, and then scrapped altogether. By 1996, VH1 was heading down the same path as its sister channel, MTV, choosing to focus more on music-related shows than on music videos. Additionally, the network began to expand its playlist of music videos to include more rock music.<ref name=\"b and c\"/> Old episodes of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' could regularly be seen on the channel. By that time, the channel's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were beginning to fall.\n\n====''Video Countdown''====\nAs part of VH-1's re-branding as \"VH1: Music First\" in 1994, the channel launched a new series, the ''VH1 Top 10 Countdown'', that counted down the top 10 music videos played on VH1 each week. A combination of record sales, radio airplay, video spins, [[Internet forum|message board]] posts, and [[Mail|conventional mail]] would decide the order of the countdown. A rotating cast of [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] picked up hosting duties for the show over the years. The series expanded from 10 to 20 music videos, becoming the ''[[VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown]]'', in 2001. The show was renamed ''The 20'' in early 2015, and ended later that year.\n\n====''Pop-Up Video''====\nIn the fall of 1996, VH1 premiered ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'', in which music videos were accompanied by \"pop-ups\" (also known as \"bubbles\" or \"info nuggets\")\u2014small enclosed areas of the screen containing facts about the band artists, and videos such as career highlights, discography, biographical details, quotes, and anecdotes. For a time, this was VH1's highest rated show.\n\n====''VH1 Storytellers''====\n{{main|VH1 Storytellers}}\nIn February 1996, VH1 again hit it big with the premiere of the first of the network's flagship shows, ''VH1 Storytellers''. The show started with a broadcast of [[Ray Davies]], during his \"Storyteller\" tour, and took its name from this first show. In each hourlong episode, artists appear in front of a (mostly small and intimate) live audience, interspersing musical performances with anecdotes related to the songs' meaning, the songwriting process, audience reaction, etc. Along with Davies, the series has featured a widely diverse list of artists, including [[Culture Club]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Johnny Cash]], [[Kanye West]], [[Tom Waits]], and [[Def Leppard]]. [[Meat Loaf]] enjoyed the show's format so much that he bought the stage decorations from VH-1 and went on to do a \"Storytellers\" tour in 1998/1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|publisher=livedaily.com|title=Meat Loaf's \"Storytellers\" Tour Extended Through January|date=7 December 1999|accessdate=27 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044055/http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|archive-date=May 17, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====''Behind the Music''====\n{{main|Behind the Music}}\nVH1 scored another hit in August 1997 with the debut of ''Behind the Music''. The hourlong show features interviews and biographies of some of popular music's biggest stars qualified to be profiled on the series. The premiere episode featured [[Milli Vanilli]]. Episodes have ranged from [[Aaliyah]] to [[Stryper]] to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], as well as others such as, [[Meat Loaf]], [[Tori Amos]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Cher]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[TLC (music)|TLC]], [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], [[Megadeth]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Selena]], [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Pantera]], and [[Eminem]], with more episodes being produced periodically. By the late 1990s, the show began to run out of artists to profile, leading to the short-lived ''BTM2'' program, half-hour looks into bands and artists whose popularity was rising, but not yet at its peak.\n\n====''Legends''====\n{{Main|VH1's Legends}}\nShortly after, VH1 created a companion series, ''[[VH1's Legends|Legends]]'' (originally sponsored by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]), profiling artists who have made a more significant contribution to music history to qualify as \"Legends\" (that is, those artists who have gone beyond the category of ''Behind the Music'' biographies). The artists profiled so far have included <!--KEEP IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->[[Aerosmith]]; the [[Bee Gees]]; [[David Bowie]]; [[Johnny Cash]]; [[Eric Clapton]]; [[The Clash]]; [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]; [[Sam Cooke]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]; [[The Doors]]; [[John Fogerty]]; [[Aretha Franklin]]; [[Marvin Gaye]]; [[The Grateful Dead]]; [[Guns N' Roses]]; [[Jimi Hendrix]]; [[Michael Jackson]]; [[Eminem]]; [[Elton John]]; [[Janis Joplin]]; [[B.

Founded in 1997, VH1 Save The Music was the first organization in existence dedicated to restoring music programs in America's schools. For nearly 20 years, the foundation has donated over $53 million worth of new musical instruments to 2,024 public schools in 247 school districts around the country to date\u2014impacting the lives of more than three{{nbsp}}million public school students.

Also in 1999, [[Donna Summer]] who was asked to do the \"diva\" concert, was given her own concert special by VH1 \"Donna Summer Live and More: Encore\". Some female artists such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Cher]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Faith Hill]] were featured in two or more VH1 divas concerts, with [[Cyndi Lauper]] appearing the most times, having been featured in four concerts. In 2000, [[Diana Ross]], who has been asked several times to appear on previous editions, appeared in her own edition of the special, \"VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute To Diana Ross\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRmhiwuwvzY</ref>\n\n====''Movies That Rock''====\nIn 1999, VH1 aired its first original movie, a biopic on [[Sweetwater (band)|Sweetwater]]. Their third original movie (which aired in 2000), ''[[Two of Us (2000 television)|Two of Us]]'', focused on a fictional meeting between [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Over the next three years, they made over a dozen movies, including bio-pics on [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Doors]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[MC Hammer]], [[The Monkees]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Def Leppard]].\n\nVH1 continues to air \"Movies That Rock\" on a regular basis, expanding to include movies not produced by VH1. The subject matter remains mostly focused on music and musicians.\n\n====Diversification====\nIn the late 1990s, VH1 continued to get more diverse and teen-based with its music selection, and with that, the network updated its 1994 \"Big 1\" logo. Various late-night rock shows have been shown on VH1, featuring [[alternative rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] videos from the 1980s and 1990s. VH1 eventually warmed up to harder rock acts such as the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], the [[Foo Fighters]], the [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Metallica]]. Their new videos began being added into VH1's playlist right away.\n\nAround late 2002, VH1 even began to play mainstream [[hip hop music|rap]] musicians.<ref name=\"b and c\"/> The latest videos by [[Eminem]], [[Nelly]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] began to be shown in VH1's rotation and even started to cut up on VH1's top 20 countdown. VH1 also plays music from Latin artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Shakira]].\n\n====Other past trends====\n''rockDocs'' was the title under which VH1 aired various [[rockumentary|music documentaries]], both those produced by VH1 and those produced by third parties. Such documentary series produced by VH1 include \"''And Ya' Don't Stop''\", a five-part series on the history of hip-hop and rap,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925111.html?categoryid=32&cs=1|title = And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip Hop|publisher = Variety | date = 3 October 2004|author = Phil Gallo}}</ref> a four-part series on the history of heavy metal, ''[[Heavy: The Story of Metal]]'', and ''[[The Drug Years]]'', which tells the story of various drug cultures that changed America.

Critics have claimed prisoners, mainly those convicted of murder, should not be entitled to any exposure, especially nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/1712084/detail.html|title=Philadelphia News, Local News, Weather, Traffic, and Breaking News|work=NBC 10 Philadelphia|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe channel aired ''[[Where Are They Now?

Each episode was dedicated to a specific genre, ranging from past child stars to [[Aaron Spelling#Notable productions|Aaron Spelling's notable productions]], to controversial news figures.\n\nVH1 also aired a series of spots in 2003, featuring animated kittens from the online animation website Rathergood, lipsyncing popular songs such as [[Joan Jett]]'s \"[[I Love Rock n' Roll]]\", [[Culture Club]]'s \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\" and [[Guns N' Roses]]' \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\".

At of the beginning of October 2008, ''Nocturnal State'' was cut down to one hour, and ''Fresh: New Music'' was supplanted by additional hours of ''Jump Start''. In 2010, VH1 retired ''Nocturnal State''. Music Videos continued to be branded under ''Jump Start'' until January 5, 2013.\n\n====''I Love\u2026'' series (2002\u20132014)====\n{{further|I Love...#VH1 series}}\nIn 2002, VH1 broadcast a ten-part series entitled ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]''. The series was adapted from a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] series, first broadcast in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/|title=BBC Two - I Love the 1970s|work=BBC|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's ''I Love the '80s'', coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from [[2003 in television|2003's]] ''[[I Love the '70s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '70s]]'', to further variants like ''[[I Love the '80s Strikes Back]]'', ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'', and ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. More recently, VH1 premiered ''[[I Love the '80s 3-D]]'' and ''[[I Love the '70s: Volume 2]]''. So eager was the network to capitalize on the trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, despite the fact that the decade had not yet ended (''[[I Love the New Millennium]]'', broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000\u20132007). This was thought to be the final installment of the series until 2014, when ''[[I Love the 2000s]]'' continued the format.\n\nThe concept was broadened to include non-decade based installments, ''[[I Love the Holidays]]'' and ''[[I Love Toys]]''. The format of these shows has also been repeated for the weekly program ''[[Best Week Ever]]''.\n\n====''The Greatest'' series====\nVH1 also produces its ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|The Greatest]]'' series in which a similar format is used to countdown lists like ''\"100 Greatest Artists of Rock and Roll\"'', ''\"The 50 Sexiest Video Moments\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Songs of Rock 'N' Roll\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Songs from the Past 25 Years\"'', ''\"100 Greatest One-hit Wonders\"'', ''\"100 Greatest Kid Stars\"'', and ''\"100 Greatest Teen Stars\"''.

The term appears to have been coined by Michael Gross, writing for The Toronto Star on May 12, 1991. In his article, entitled \"Celebrity's New Face,\" Mr. Gross used a hyphenated form of the word (\"celeb-reality\") to describe the tendency of certain contemporary celebrities to downplay the traditional trappings of [[Hollywood glamour]]. \"You could see the new celeb-reality on display at this year's Oscars,\" wrote Gross. \"It is Kathy Bates and Whoopi Goldberg, not Kim Basinger and Michelle Pfeiffer. It is Jeremy Irons in black tie and the sneakers he says keep his feet on the ground. It is Kevin Costner, fighting small, important battles, winning big, but reacting with modesty and going off to party privately. The new celebrities are human first, famous second.\"\n\nThe next known citation of the word is by Joyce Millman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 5, 2003. In an article entitled, \"Celebreality: The 'Stars' Are Elbowing Their Way In,\" Ms. Millman wrote: \"Celebreality, the junk genre du jour, turns the notion of reality TV upside down. Instead of real people acting like celebrities on shows like \"Survivor\", \"Big Brother\" and \"The Bachelor\", celebreality gives us celebrities acting like real people on shows like \"The Osbournes\", \"The Anna Nicole Show\" and \"Celebrity Boot Camp.\" I'm using the term \"celebrity\" loosely here\u2014we're not talking about Russell Crowe, Julia Roberts and Dame Judi Dench eating bugs and scrubbing latrines. No, the celebrities of celebreality are a motlier crew, like, well, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Vince Neil, the former rap superstar M. C. Hammer and the wee ex-Michael Jackson ornament Emmanuel (\"Webster\") Lewis. Those three will be setting up housekeeping together on Thursday in \"The Surreal Life\" on WB, a celebreality spin on MTV's \"Real World.\" Not to be outdone, ABC sends a Baldwin brother (Stephen), a supermodel (Frederique) and a former \"L.A. Law\" star (Corbin Bernsen) to Hawaii for \"Celebrity Mole Hawaii\", beginning Wednesday.\"\n\nThe VH1 Celebreality block has also aired shows such as:\n*2003: ''[[Surviving Nugent]]'' sent eight individuals to [[Ted Nugent]]'s house to compete in various games and activities.

It was restored in 1808 but finally closed in 1882.   In recent times it came to refer to the group of academic faculties of the [[University of Paris]], as opposed to the professional faculties of law and medicine.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>   It is also used to refer to the [[Sorbonne|main building]]  of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]], which houses several faculties created when the University was divided up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche. (2013).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]] was the son of peasants from the village of [[Sorbon]] in the [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]], who had become a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and the confessor and chaplain of King [[Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). At the time that he founded his college, the [[University of Paris]] had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students.  Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support.  Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not.  Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>\n\nSorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students.  The college opened in 1257 with about twenty students, called ''socii''.  As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref> \n  \nThe Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>  It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of [[Protestant]] doctrines.  Its students included [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who studied there from 1606 to 1607.   Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622.  Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne;  he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard.  Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel.  Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.<ref>Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'' (2012), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris. ({{ISBN|978-2-755-8033-03}})</ref>\n\nThe Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]]. For a brief time, under [[Robespierre]], the chapel became a Temple of Reason.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turned the college buildings into studios for artists.  In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris.\nIn 1885,  as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the theology faculty was officially closed.  The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by [[Henri Paul N\u00e9not]],  opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution.  It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences.  The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties.  The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, II, III, IV, V, the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes]], and the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]].\n\n==Foundation==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]], a native of [[Le R\u00e9thelois]], was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal [[mendicant]] orders\u2014the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]]\u2014each had [[college]]s at Paris where they delivered lectures which extern students could attend without fee.\n\nRobert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the [[cenobitic]] life, except in vows.  His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends.  The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. [[Guillaume de Saint-Amour]], [[G\u00e9rard d'Abbeville]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Guillaume des Grez]], [[Odo or Eudes of Douai]], [[Chr\u00e9tien de Beauvais]], [[G\u00e9rard de Reims]], [[Nicolas de Bar]] were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it.  These [[Expert|savants]] were already attached to the university staff.\n\n==Organization==\nThe constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (''provisor''), associates (''socii''), and guests (''hospites''). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.\n\nThe associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of [[philosophy]]. There were two kinds of associates, the {{lang|fr|bursaires}} and the {{lang|fr|pensionnaires}}. The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The [[bursary|burse]] could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the [[prior]], who presided over all internal affairs of the house.\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctor]]s and [[bachelor]]s were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors.  Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.\n\n==History==\nThe ordinary lectures were public, and consequently were attended by students who belonged to neither of the divisions of the society. The doctors and bachelors were authorized to give shelter to other poor pupils. Besides the work of the classroom, there was the duty of preaching or labouring in the parishes. In preparation for this, the associates, on certain days, had to deliver sermons or conferences (''collationes'') to the community. The purely spiritual side was not forgotten.  Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.\n\nFor twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted.  He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles.  This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Calvi]] or the \"little Sorbonne\".\n\nThe constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude H\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (1574\u20131650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, \"Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus\", its realization became a model college for others.  The expression ''Pauvres ma\u00eetres et \u00e9tudiants en th\u00e9ologie'' seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were bursaires; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, ''Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales'', and referred to the college as ''pauperem nostram Sorbonem''.\n\nFrom the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. [[Pope Alexander IV]] (1259) urged the French [[bishop]]s to support it, [[Urban IV]] (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and [[Clement IV]] (1268) granted it papal approbation.  Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the ''actus Sorbonnicus'', or examination for degrees, including the defence of the \"thesis Robertina\", became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected.  From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.\n\nIn 1470 the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s associates, [[Gering (printer)|Gering]], [[Friburger]], and [[Crantz (printer)|Crantz]].  Among its principal patrons and benefactors was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the [[church of the Sorbonne]], where his tomb is still preserved.\n\nThe doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of [[Protestantism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].

It was restored in 1808 but finally closed in 1882.

(2013).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nRobert de Sorbon was the son of peasants from the village of Sorbon in the Ardennes, who had become a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and the confessor and chaplain of King [[Louis IX]] (Saint Louis).   At the time that he founded his college, the [[University of Paris]] had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students.  Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support.  Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not.  Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>\n\nSorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students.  The college opened in 1257 with about twenty students, called ''socii''.  As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref> \n  \nThe Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>  It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of [[Protestant]] doctrines.  Its students included [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who studied there from 1606 to 1607.   Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622.  Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne;  he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard.  Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel.  Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.<ref>Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'' (2012), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris. ({{ISBN|978-2-755-8033-03}})</ref>\n\nThe Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]]. For a brief time, under [[Robespierre]], the chapel became a Temple of Reason.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turned the college buildings into studios for artists.  In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris.\nIn 1885,  as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the theology faculty was officially closed.  The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by [[Henri Paul N\u00e9not]],  opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution.  It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences.  The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties.  The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, II, III, IV, V, the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes]], and the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]].\n\n==Foundation==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]], a native of [[Le R\u00e9thelois]], was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal [[mendicant]] orders\u2014the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]]\u2014each had [[college]]s at Paris where they delivered lectures which extern students could attend without fee.\n\nRobert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the [[cenobitic]] life, except in vows.  His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends.  The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. [[Guillaume de Saint-Amour]], [[G\u00e9rard d'Abbeville]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Guillaume des Grez]], [[Odo or Eudes of Douai]], [[Chr\u00e9tien de Beauvais]], [[G\u00e9rard de Reims]], [[Nicolas de Bar]] were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it.  These [[Expert|savants]] were already attached to the university staff.\n\n==Organization==\nThe constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (''provisor''), associates (''socii''), and guests (''hospites''). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.\n\nThe associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of [[philosophy]]. There were two kinds of associates, the {{lang|fr|bursaires}} and the {{lang|fr|pensionnaires}}. The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The [[bursary|burse]] could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the [[prior]], who presided over all internal affairs of the house.\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctor]]s and [[bachelor]]s were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors.  Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.\n\n==History==\nThe ordinary lectures were public, and consequently were attended by students who belonged to neither of the divisions of the society. The doctors and bachelors were authorized to give shelter to other poor pupils. Besides the work of the classroom, there was the duty of preaching or labouring in the parishes. In preparation for this, the associates, on certain days, had to deliver sermons or conferences (''collationes'') to the community. The purely spiritual side was not forgotten.  Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.\n\nFor twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted.  He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles.  This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Calvi]] or the \"little Sorbonne\".\n\nThe constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude H\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (1574\u20131650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, \"Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus\", its realization became a model college for others.  The expression ''Pauvres ma\u00eetres et \u00e9tudiants en th\u00e9ologie'' seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were bursaires; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, ''Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales'', and referred to the college as ''pauperem nostram Sorbonem''.\n\nFrom the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. [[Pope Alexander IV]] (1259) urged the French [[bishop]]s to support it, [[Urban IV]] (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and [[Clement IV]] (1268) granted it papal approbation.  Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the ''actus Sorbonnicus'', or examination for degrees, including the defence of the \"thesis Robertina\", became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected.  From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.\n\nIn 1470 the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s associates, [[Gering (printer)|Gering]], [[Friburger]], and [[Crantz (printer)|Crantz]].  Among its principal patrons and benefactors was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the [[church of the Sorbonne]], where his tomb is still preserved.\n\nThe doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of [[Protestantism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].  As other teachers of theology in the university became members of the Sorbonne, by the beginning of the sixteenth century, its staff was practically identical with the university faculty.  De Sorbon had created a library.  It expanded rapidly, due to numerous gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, the professors gave their support to [[Gallicanism]] and obliged their members to subscribe to the \"four articles\".  This attitude naturally weakened the prestige of the Sorbonne as a theological school.  Ecclesiastical students had to seek their education in the seminaries. The Sorbonne itself was suppressed by decree of 5 April 1792, after the French Revolution.\n\nNapoleon restored it in 1808 as the theological faculty of the newly organized university.

During [[World War II]] the company produced armaments as part of [[Raxwerke|Rax-Werk Ges.mbH]] which was associated with the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1841 the Wiener Neustadt-Vienna railway line was open, and in 1842 the private railway [[Austrian Eastern Railway]] (''Wien-Raaber-Eisenbahn'' or ''Raaber Bahn'') was opened, by 1854 the [[Semmering railway]] was complete. Thus around that time a favourable situation existed for the creation of a locomotive production facility in Austria.\n\nIn 1842 in [[Wiener Neustadt]] a locomotive works was founded by [[G\u00fcnther Wenzel]], engineer of the ''Wien-Raaber-Eisenbahn'' company, the ironworks-master [[Josef Sessler]], [[Heinrich B\u00fchler]] and [[Fidelius Armbruster]]. The plant was built on land to the north-east of Wiener Neustadt in part on an abandoned cotton factory, and partly on a rifle and metal finishing plant.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Sale to Georg Sigl===\nFrom 1845 the company was wholly owned by Wenzel Gunther; it was sold in 1861 to the ''Vienna Maschinenfabrik'' owner [[Georg Sigl]] who expanded it into the largest plant in the Empire. By 1870 the 1000th locomotive had been made and the workforce exceeded 4000. The product line was expanded to include printing presses and other machinery. In 1875, the company became an ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]'' (public company) named '''''Aktien Gesellschaft der Lokomotiv-Fabrik vormals G.

Thus around that time a favourable situation existed for the creation of a locomotive production facility in Austria.\n\nIn 1842 in [[Wiener Neustadt]] a locomotive works was founded by [[G\u00fcnther Wenzel]], engineer of the ''Wien-Raaber-Eisenbahn'' company, the ironworks-master [[Josef Sessler]], [[Heinrich B\u00fchler]] and [[Fidelius Armbruster]]. The plant was built on land to the north-east of Wiener Neustadt in part on an abandoned cotton factory, and partly on a rifle and metal finishing plant.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Sale to Georg Sigl===\nFrom 1845 the company was wholly owned by Wenzel Gunther; it was sold in 1861 to the ''Vienna Maschinenfabrik'' owner [[Georg Sigl]] who expanded it into the largest plant in the Empire. By 1870 the 1000th locomotive had been made and the workforce exceeded 4000. The product line was expanded to include printing presses and other machinery.

The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor [[Richard O'Brien]], who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 [[Musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a [[parody]] tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and horror [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Barry Bostwick]] and is narrated by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] with cast members from the original [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], and [[Belasco Theatre]] productions including [[Nell Campbell]] and [[Patricia Quinn]].\n\nThe story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]], an apparently [[mad scientist]] who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and on location at an old country estate named [[Oakley Court]], best known for its earlier use by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. A number of [[Theatrical property|props]] and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many [[kitsch]] science fiction and horror films, costume designer [[Sue Blane]] conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of [[punk fashion|punk rock fashion]] trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.<ref name=\"punkblane\">{{cite book|last= Thompson | first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|url = https://books.google.com/?id=qx6GDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1785&lpg=PA1785&dq=Sue+blane,+punk+rock#v=onepage&q=Sue%20blane%2C%20punk%20rock&f=false  |title= The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic|publisher = Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|date=1 February 2016 | page = 1785|isbn= 978-1495007477}}</ref>\n\nAlthough largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a [[midnight movie]] when audiences began participating with the film at the [[Waverly Theater]] in [[New York City]] in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This \"shadow cast\" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines. Still in [[limited release]] four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to [[Halloween]]. Today, the film has [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|a large international cult following]] and has been considered by many as [[List of films considered the best#Genres or media#Musical|one of the greatest musical films of all time]]. It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Criminology|criminologist]] narrates the tale of the newly engaged and innocent couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy late November evening, near a town called Denton in 1974. Seeking a telephone, the couple walks to a nearby castle where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed \"sweet [[transvestism|transvestite]] from Transsexual, Transylvania\". The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.\n\nIn his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the \"secret to life itself\". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank's ex-lover and Columbia's current partner, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie then proceeds to seduce Columbia, get the Transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue Brad and Janet. When Rocky starts dancing and enjoying the performance, a jealous Frank kills Eddie with a pickax. Columbia screams in horror, devastated by Eddie's death. Frank justifies killing Eddie as a \"[[Euthanasia|mercy killing]]\" to Rocky and they depart to the bridal suite.\n\nBrad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, when she discovers Frank performing oral sex on Brad via a video monitor. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.\n\nAfter discovering that his creation is missing, Frank returns to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him; Brad denies any knowledge of it, and Dr. Scott assures Frank that Brad is totally not involved in UFOs. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.\n\nRocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the [[Medusa]] Transducer, transforming them into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costume, Frank \"unfreezes\" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an [[RKO]] tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader.\n\nRiff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has \"failed his mission\". An enraged Rocky gathers Frank in his arms, climbs to the top of the tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, \"lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, an eccentric bisexual transvestite scientist \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Janet Weiss, a heroine\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Brad Majors, a hero\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Riff Raff, a handyman\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Magenta, a domestic\n* [[Nell Campbell]] (credited as Little Nell) as Columbia, a groupie\n* [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Dr. Everett V.

The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor [[Richard O'Brien]], who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 [[Musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a [[parody]] tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and horror [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Barry Bostwick]] and is narrated by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] with cast members from the original [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], and [[Belasco Theatre]] productions including [[Nell Campbell]] and [[Patricia Quinn]].\n\nThe story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]], an apparently [[mad scientist]] who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and on location at an old country estate named [[Oakley Court]], best known for its earlier use by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. A number of [[Theatrical property|props]] and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many [[kitsch]] science fiction and horror films, costume designer [[Sue Blane]] conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of [[punk fashion|punk rock fashion]] trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.<ref name=\"punkblane\">{{cite book|last= Thompson | first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|url = https://books.google.com/?id=qx6GDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1785&lpg=PA1785&dq=Sue+blane,+punk+rock#v=onepage&q=Sue%20blane%2C%20punk%20rock&f=false  |title= The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic|publisher = Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|date=1 February 2016 | page = 1785|isbn= 978-1495007477}}</ref>\n\nAlthough largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a [[midnight movie]] when audiences began participating with the film at the [[Waverly Theater]] in [[New York City]] in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This \"shadow cast\" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines. Still in [[limited release]] four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to [[Halloween]]. Today, the film has [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|a large international cult following]] and has been considered by many as [[List of films considered the best#Genres or media#Musical|one of the greatest musical films of all time]]. It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Criminology|criminologist]] narrates the tale of the newly engaged and innocent couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy late November evening, near a town called Denton in 1974. Seeking a telephone, the couple walks to a nearby castle where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed \"sweet [[transvestism|transvestite]] from Transsexual, Transylvania\". The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.\n\nIn his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the \"secret to life itself\". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank's ex-lover and Columbia's current partner, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie then proceeds to seduce Columbia, get the Transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue Brad and Janet. When Rocky starts dancing and enjoying the performance, a jealous Frank kills Eddie with a pickax. Columbia screams in horror, devastated by Eddie's death. Frank justifies killing Eddie as a \"[[Euthanasia|mercy killing]]\" to Rocky and they depart to the bridal suite.\n\nBrad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, when she discovers Frank performing oral sex on Brad via a video monitor. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.\n\nAfter discovering that his creation is missing, Frank returns to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him; Brad denies any knowledge of it, and Dr. Scott assures Frank that Brad is totally not involved in UFOs. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.\n\nRocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the [[Medusa]] Transducer, transforming them into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costume, Frank \"unfreezes\" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an [[RKO]] tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader.\n\nRiff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has \"failed his mission\". An enraged Rocky gathers Frank in his arms, climbs to the top of the tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, \"lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, an eccentric bisexual transvestite scientist \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Janet Weiss, a heroine\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Brad Majors, a hero\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Riff Raff, a handyman\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Magenta, a domestic\n* [[Nell Campbell]] (credited as Little Nell) as Columbia, a groupie\n* [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Dr. Everett V.

According to [[J. Hoberman]], author of ''Midnight Movies'', it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience. Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other ''Rocky Horror'' pioneers\u2014including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian\u2014did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh. This quickly caught on with other theater goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.<ref name=\"Dika2003\"/> Performance groups became a staple at ''Rocky Horror'' screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\"/> The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic [[Sal Piro]] and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr. Frank N. Furter and was one of several performers\u2014including Will Kohler as Brad Majors, Nora Poses as Janet, and Lilias Piro as Magenta\u2014in a flexible rotating cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\"/> The performances of the audience were scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters.<ref name=\"MathijsSexton2012\">{{cite book|author1=Ernest Mathijs|author2=Jamie Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&pg=PA101 |date=30 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=101\u2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Garrett3.jpg|thumb|upright|D.

As a result of the \"COBRA\" (or Common Branding) project, the entire airline was rebranded Qantas about a year later with tickets stating in small print \"Australian Airlines Limited trading as Qantas Airways Limited\" until the adoption of a single Air Operator Certificate a few years later. At that point, the entire airline was officially renamed \"Qantas Airways Limited\" continuing the name and livery of the parent company with the only change being the change of by-line from \"The Spirit of Australia\" to \"The Australian Airline\" under the window line with the existing \"Qantas\" title appearing above.\n\nDuring its period as TAA, the company played a major part in the development of the Australian domestic air transport industry. The establishment of TAA broke the domestic air transport monopoly of [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) in the late 1940s, and taking over the [[Queensland]] air network from Qantas. It was also at the time TAA supported the [[Flying Doctor Services of Australia]] by providing aircraft, pilots and engineers to ensure every emergency was answered quickly. Qantas had also been instrumental in the formation of the Flying Doctor Service.\n\nThe airline's headquarters were located in [[Melbourne]].<ref>\"World Airline Directory.\" ''[[Flight International]]''. 27 March-2 April 1991.

Retrieved on 5 April 2010.</ref> In 1954 TAA became the first airline outside Europe to introduce the [[Vickers Viscount]] \"propjet\", and in 1981 it introduced the [[Airbus A300]], the first [[wide-body aircraft]] to be purchased by an Australian domestic airline providing TAA with a clear edge over major competitor at the time, [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] which had purchased instead, the [[Boeing 767-200]], receiving the type approximately a year later. Ironically, although the A300s were initially painted in full Qantas livery, they were phased out within a few years being replaced by previously international operated Qantas 767-238ERs, 767-338ERs and later supplemented by seven ex [[British Airways]] 767-336ERs.\n\nQantas revived the [[Australian Airlines]] brand between 2002 and 2006 to serve the low-cost leisure market of visitors to and from Australia but using a full-service model, operating selected Qantas 767-338ERs \u2013 although the livery used was not the same as that used by the previous domestic operation.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Background===\nUp until [[World War II]], Australia had been one of the world's leading centres of aviation. With its tiny population of about seven million, Australia ranked sixth in the world for scheduled air mileage, had 16 airlines, was growing at twice the world average, and had produced a number of prominent aviation pioneers, including [[Lawrence Hargrave]], [[Harry Hawker]], [[Bert Hinkler]], [[Lawrence Wackett]], the Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]], [[Sidney Cotton]], [[Keith Virtue]] and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]]. Governments on both sides of politics, well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of Australia, regarded air transport as a matter of national importance (as did the governments of other geographically large nations, such as the Soviet Union and the United States). In the words of Director General of Civil Aviation [[AB Corbett]], <blockquote>\n''A nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation.''<ref name=\"Trans-AustraliaAirlinesMuseum_CorbettQuote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taamuseum.org.au/ANAC_Taa.htm|title=ANAC \u2013 Beginning of TAA|date=12 May 2009|accessdate=28 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308015241/http://www.taamuseum.org.au/ANAC_Taa.htm|archivedate=8 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n</blockquote> Air transport was encouraged both with direct subsidies and with mail contracts. Immediately before the start of the war, more than half of all airline passenger and freight miles were subsidised.\n\nHowever, after 1939 and especially after Japan's invasion of the islands to the north in 1941, civil aviation was sacrificed to military needs. By the end of the war, there were only nine domestic airlines remaining, eight smaller regional concerns and [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA), a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] owned by British and Australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85% of all government air transport subsidies.\n\nThe [[First Chifley Ministry|Chifley Government's]] view was summed up by Minister for Air, [[Arthur Drakeford]]: ''Where are the great pioneers of aviation?  .....  We discover that one by one the small pioneer enterprises are disappearing from the register. It is the inevitable process of absorption by a monopoly.''  Air transport, the government believed, was primarily a [[Public services|public service]], like hospitals, the railways or the post office. If there was to be a monopoly at all, then it should be one owned by the public and working in the public interest.\n\nIn August 1945, only two days after the end of [[World War II]], the [[Australian parliament]] passed the Australian National Airways Bill, which set up the Australian National Airways Commission (ANAC) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation's air transport industry. In keeping with the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government's [[socialist]] leanings, the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier. From this time on, it seemed, air transport in Australia would be a government monopoly. However, [[Australian National Airways Pty Ltd v Commonwealth|a legal challenge]], backed by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] opposition and business interests generally, was successful and in December 1945, the [[High Court]] ruled that the Commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies. The government could set up an airline if it wished, but it could not legislate a monopoly. Much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network, seeing it as a form of [[Nationalisation|socialisation]] by stealth.\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Trans-australia-airlines-skymaster.jpg|thumb|Trans-Australia Airlines [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|Skymaster]]]]\nWith the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions, the Australian National Airways Commission came into existence in February 1946. The commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers, including the director-general of civil aviation, the deputy director, a Labor party luminary and former member of the [[Commonwealth Bank]] board, the director-general of posts and telegraphs, and the assistant secretary of the Treasury. The commission was to be chaired by [[Arthur Coles]].\n\nColes was one of the richest men in Australia, and the co-founder of the [[Coles Group]]. By this time however, Coles had withdrawn from active management of the family business. He was 'a great believer in competition for business'<ref>Contested skies: Trans-Australian Airlines, Australian Airlines, 1946\u20131992\n By John Gunn, p 17</ref> and would not have accepted the post of Chairman of the ANAC had the monopoly provision been retained.\n\nThe Commission decided on the name \"Trans-Australia Airlines\", applied to the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury]] for a preliminary advance of \u00a310,000 and set about making plans, recruiting staff, and purchasing equipment. [[Reginald Ansett]], proprietor of the small Victorian company [[Ansett Australia|Ansett Airways]] was quick to offer to get the new airline off to a flying start by selling his entire operation to the ANAC as a going concern, including (if desired) his own services as managing agent.  The asking price, the Commission decided, was optimistic, and Ansett declined a more modest counter offer.\n\nThere was considerable correspondence between the Commission and Ivan Holyman, the Chairman of ANA, with a view to recruiting Holyman as General Manager of TAA at the princely salary of \u00a310,000 pa, and, when that offer was declined, of buying the near-monopoly airline outright.  Holyman was not willing to sell, nor to work for a government-owned body, but was interested in setting up a \"composite company\", the details of which proposal remained unclear.\n\nEventually the ANAC proceeded with the original plan, to build an airline from scratch. One of the first people hired was [[Lester Brain]], then operations manager at [[Qantas]]. Brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind Qantas' reputation for technical excellence. He applied for the advertised position of TAA Operations Manager, but to his surprise and delight, was instead offered an appointment as General Manager&nbsp;\u2014 though at \u00a33,000 pa, not the \u00a310,000 that had been offered to Holyman.\n[[File:TAA Douglas DC-3 BNE Wheatley.jpg|thumb|left|TAA [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Brisbane Airport]], early 1970s]]\nTAA acquired its first two aircraft in mid-June 1946, both [[Douglas DC-3]]s. A dozen more DC-3s would be added over the next few months, all ex-[[Royal Australian Air Force]] aircraft originally bought by the Australian Government under [[Lend-Lease|lend-lease]]. In July, the Treasury released \u00a3350,000 to allow TAA to order four larger, more modern [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]]s from [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] in the United States, and Brain appointed [[Aubrey Koch]] (from Qantas) as Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster and John Watkins as Chief Technical Officer. Watkins would become one of the key figures in TAA's success. His first task was to travel to the United States to accept delivery of the DC-4s. He later wrote:\n\n:''To my utter astonishment Arthur Coles, after the expected pep-talk about the DC-4 assignment, said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival, at a competitive price.''\n\nIt was typical of Coles, who knew nothing about aircraft, to reason that quality equipment would be vital, and then select the best man for the job of finding it and be prepared to back his judgement.\n\nAt this point, political considerations came to the fore again. TAA planned to start regular services on 7 October, but there was a [[1946 Australian federal election|federal election]] set for 28 September. Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] had been enormously popular during the darkest hours, but was voted out at the first post-war opportunity. There was no certainty that the Chifley Government would not be treated likewise, and the opposition was opposed to government ownership. Coles addressed the Commission at a meeting on 2 September 1946.\n\n: ''Gentlemen, the Government wants us to start services as soon as possible. There is a Federal election on 28 September. If we don't have an airline up and running by then and Labor loses the election there'll be no airline. We'll be out of a job. Any suggestions?''\n\nAfter some discussion it was agreed that the airline was not ready. It had a name, some excellent pilots, and some aircraft, but no ground facilities, no sales staff, no documentation, not even tickets. With a great deal of effort, it should be possible to make the planned start date of 7 October. With the discussion complete, Coles said:\n:''I have news for you. We start next Monday.''\n\nAfter a week of frantic effort hiring staff, borrowing a tin shed at the [[RAAF Williams|RAAF base at Laverton]] because [[Essendon Airport]] had been turned into mud by heavy rain, creating operations manuals, passenger manifests, tickets, and load sheets&nbsp;\u2014 even making passenger steps and baggage carts because there was no time to buy them in the ordinary way&nbsp;\u2014 Captains Hepburn and Nickels took off from Laverton at 5:45&nbsp;am bound for Sydney. TAA's first scheduled flight carried a full load of VIPs and just one paying passenger.\n\n===Rapid expansion===\n[[File:Fokker F.27-100 VH-TFF TAA ESS 24.09.70 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fokker Friendship]] Series 100 of TAA at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]] in 1970.]]\nThe subsequent few years led to massive growth for the new airline. As post-war austerity gave way to a more affluent era, Australians were able to travel by air in ever increasing numbers.\n\nMuch of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned [[Ansett Australia|Ansett-ANA]] and the government-supported TAA. A major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft. After initially utilising the venerable and readily available [[Douglas DC-3]], TAA was able to acquire the revolutionary pressurised [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 240]]. Popular with the travelling public because of its ability to fly above much of the weather, it was really this aircraft that established the airline's reputation for excellence and service reliability.\n\n[[File:Douglas DC-9-31 VH-TJN TAA ESS 12.04.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|TAA [[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-31]] ''[[Pawe\u0142 Strzelecki|Paul Strzelecki]]'' awaiting passengers at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]] in 1971, wearing the 1964-1969 ''Whispering T-Jet'' colour scheme used exclusively on DC-9s and [[Boeing 727]]s.]]\n\nEast-coast services were continually expanded and TAA soon earned its title as a true 'trans Australian' airline with services to [[Perth Airport|Perth]] on the west coast of the continent, using [[Douglas DC-4]] aircraft. [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprop aircraft were introduced in the 1950s and again proved immensely popular as a result of their smooth, vibration-free ride.\n\nAlthough government-owned, the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Liberal conservative government]] of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned Ansett and the requirements of TAA suffered as a result. The controversial [[Two Airlines Policy]] was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval.\n\nFlight numbers and schedules were strictly controlled, and TAA and Ansett-ANA invariably had flights departing airports for the same destination at exactly the same time with exactly the same equipment. The policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft (one from each airline) were required on their delivery flights to enter Australian airspace at exactly the same time.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lockheed L-188A VH-TLA TAA Essendon 30.01.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|TAA's first Lockheed Electra II four-engined turboprop airliner at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]], January 1971, wearing the 1960-1969 ''Jetliner'' colour scheme]]\nThe conservative government's benevolent attitude towards Ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced TAA to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop Viscount aircraft with Ansett-ANA in return for slower and older, piston-engined [[Douglas DC-6B]]s. In another instance, TAA had planned to re-equip with the revolutionary [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] pure-jet but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs, both airlines were required to purchase the Ansett preference: the less advanced turbo-prop [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]].\n\nNonetheless the Electra proved a reliable aircraft and TAA continuously grew and prospered. In the 1960s it introduced [[Boeing 727-100]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] ''Whispering T-Jets'' on primary routes as well as [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] ''Jetliner'' turboprops on regional routes.\n\nBy the late 1960s it had a massive network criss-crossing the continent, as well as an internal network within [[Papua New Guinea]] and flights from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to [[Baucau]] in [[Portuguese Timor|Portuguese]] [[East Timor|Timor]]. At this time the airline's livery was the famous white '''''T''''' on a blue tail, referred to as ''The Look of the '70s''. One of the more memorable television advertisements of the period was the jingle ''\"Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly Friendly Way\"'', whose lyrics and music were a variation on the 1967 song ''[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up and Away]]'', written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline [[TWA]].\n\nFurther expansion occurred in the 1970s and larger [[Boeing 727|727-276s]] (simultaneously with Ansett) were acquired. Once again the terms of the introduction were restricted by the two-airline policy.\n\nThe policy was marginally relaxed in the early 1980s when TAA was able to introduce the [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B4]], whilst Ansett chose to purchase the [[Boeing 767]]. The A300 was a revolutionary aircraft at the time for the domestic airline industry, in that it was a wide-body (twin aisle) aircraft. It provided significant extra capacity on the trunk east coast network and to [[Perth Airport|Perth]]. In 1986, Trans-Australia Airlines was rebranded as 'Australian Airlines' and the kangaroo returned to its livery.  Its new image coincided with a very successful and popular television campaign: \"You Should See Us Now\", \"Face To Face\" and \"The Way We Do The Things We Do\" became the carrier's new theme songs.\n\n=== Rebranding ===\n[[File:Australian Airlines Boeing 727-276 at Brisbane.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Boeing 727]] at [[Brisbane Airport]] in March 1992]]\nIn 1986, after a change of airline management, the name Trans-Australia Airlines was controversially dropped, in favour of '''Australian Airlines'''. Associated with this image change was a new livery for the airlines' aircraft, which wore the title ''Australian''.\n\nAustralian Airlines was the travel sponsor for the television shows ''[[Neighbours]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australia)|Wheel of Fortune]] and [[Sale of the Century]]'' between late 1987 and 1994.\n\nBetween 1980 and the merger with Qantas, selected teams participating in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] bore both Trans Australian Airlines (TAA) and Australian Airlines insignia, and from 1985 to 1990 the [[Seven Network]] commentary team used the airline to travel between the states to attend the various racing venues.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the government began to move towards deregulation of domestic aviation. (Deregulation took effect in October 1990.<ref>http://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/1995/files/is_006.pdf</ref>) A by-product of this impending change was the [[1989 Australian pilots' dispute]]. As the result of prolonged wage suppression, this dispute saw the resignation of the majority of Australian Airlines' aircrew and the basic structure of the airline was changed forever. The [[Hawke Government|Hawke cabinet]] not only encouraged the airline companies to employ overseas \"strike breakers\" but went even further, opting to pay the newly employed pilots from the public purse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/cabinet-papers-198889-pilots-strike-orbital-engine-pow-pension-big-brother-20150101-12ghx5.html|title=Cabinet papers 1988-89: pilots' strike; orbital engine; POW pension; Big Brother|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=1 January 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\n===Downturn===\nThe early 1990s changed the face of Australian domestic air travel. The Federal Government, although technically having deregulated the domestic aviation sector, made it effectively impossible for new entrant [[Compass Airlines (Australia)|Compass Airlines]] to succeed. In 1987, the [[Second Hawke Ministry|Hawke Government]] announced that the then government-owned domestic air terminals would be effectively privatised and leased to the two domestic airlines. Compass, a threat to the TAA/Ansett duopoly, was granted severely limited access to terminal facilities. At [[Sydney Airport]] both major airlines had effectively been given freehold ownership of their two separate terminals. The [[Federal Airports Corporation]] later purchased the Ansett terminal when it went broke in 2002. Any third airline operating there had to make do with the regional airline facilities. At other airports the two airlines had leased mostly empty terminals and installed all operational furnishings themselves. The airport authorities eagerly accepted lease money from Compass while providing almost no space in their terminals.\n\nThe ambitious new airline was allocated by the government what were clearly the worst gates, in the least desirable sections of domestic terminals across the country (in some cases, Atco huts were used) and had to operate from the international terminal at [[Perth Airport]]. As the result of liens placed over the Compass aircraft (due to alleged non-payment of airways expenses), the government's Civil Aviation Authority effectively caused the shutting down of Compass on 20 December 1991, 5 days before what would have been the immensely profitable Christmas travel period.<ref>[[Airservices Australia v Canadian Airlines International Ltd]]</ref> A seemingly well-orchestrated plan saw the Compass aircraft quickly flown out of the country and, with them, potentially the demise of a truly deregulated domestic aviation sector.\n\nAnsett and TAA/Australian were the sole remaining players, in effect a de facto two-airline policy yet again. Throughout this period of transformation and deregulation, Australian Airlines continued its successful run by posting healthy profits, increasing passenger loads and gained much favour from its catchy television commercials.  Although the merger with Qantas was seen as inevitable to give the latter a domestic network \u2014 and revive its bottom line \u2014 many former staff of Australian Airlines (TAA) and the general public mourned the loss of this iconic Australian brand.\n\n===Acquisition by Qantas===\nAlthough Compass was controversially and perhaps inevitably forced out of business, Australian's days, and those of Ansett, were numbered: the decision had been made at Federal Government level to offer both government-owned carriers (Qantas and Australian) for sale. Australian Airlines was offered first but was quickly snapped up by Qantas, which offered $400m to purchase the domestic carrier. Qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network; subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float, after selling a cornerstone 25% stake to British Airways, thus returning Qantas to the stock market after being absent from listing since 1947.\n\n[[Qantas]] acquired Australian Airlines on 14 September 1992,<ref name=\"qantas history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/history-expanding/global/en|title=Expanding Overseas...and at Home - Qantas|website=www.qantas.com.au|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> in preparation for its closure on 30 April 1994.<ref>Reid, Gordon. \"Major Airline Directory\", ''Australian Aviation'' magazine No. 96, May 1994, p72-82.

The sole remaining Australian Airlines brand identity \u2013 The Australian Way (inflight) magazine \u2013 was rebranded as The Qantas Magazine in 2016.\n\n===Rebirth===\nIn October 2002, Qantas revived the [[Australian Airlines]] brand as a full-service carrier, targeting the low-cost leisure market and flying primarily out of [[Cairns]] and [[Bali]]. This airline was disbanded in 2006 and its assets were absorbed back into the Qantas group.<ref name=\"qantas history\" />\n\n===TAA Museum===\nQantas currently allocates space at its Airport West Training Facility (formerly the TAA/Australian Airlines Flight Training Centre) for ''The TAA Museum''.

As a result of the \"COBRA\" (or Common Branding) project, the entire airline was rebranded Qantas about a year later with tickets stating in small print \"Australian Airlines Limited trading as Qantas Airways Limited\" until the adoption of a single Air Operator Certificate a few years later. At that point, the entire airline was officially renamed \"Qantas Airways Limited\" continuing the name and livery of the parent company with the only change being the change of by-line from \"The Spirit of Australia\" to \"The Australian Airline\" under the window line with the existing \"Qantas\" title appearing above.\n\nDuring its period as TAA, the company played a major part in the development of the Australian domestic air transport industry. The establishment of TAA broke the domestic air transport monopoly of [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) in the late 1940s, and taking over the [[Queensland]] air network from Qantas. It was also at the time TAA supported the [[Flying Doctor Services of Australia]] by providing aircraft, pilots and engineers to ensure every emergency was answered quickly. Qantas had also been instrumental in the formation of the Flying Doctor Service.\n\nThe airline's headquarters were located in [[Melbourne]].<ref>\"World Airline Directory.\" ''[[Flight International]]''. 27 March-2 April 1991.

Retrieved on 5 April 2010.</ref> In 1954 TAA became the first airline outside Europe to introduce the [[Vickers Viscount]] \"propjet\", and in 1981 it introduced the [[Airbus A300]], the first [[wide-body aircraft]] to be purchased by an Australian domestic airline providing TAA with a clear edge over major competitor at the time, [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] which had purchased instead, the [[Boeing 767-200]], receiving the type approximately a year later. Ironically, although the A300s were initially painted in full Qantas livery, they were phased out within a few years being replaced by previously international operated Qantas 767-238ERs, 767-338ERs and later supplemented by seven ex [[British Airways]] 767-336ERs.\n\nQantas revived the [[Australian Airlines]] brand between 2002 and 2006 to serve the low-cost leisure market of visitors to and from Australia but using a full-service model, operating selected Qantas 767-338ERs \u2013 although the livery used was not the same as that used by the previous domestic operation.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Background===\nUp until [[World War II]], Australia had been one of the world's leading centres of aviation. With its tiny population of about seven million, Australia ranked sixth in the world for scheduled air mileage, had 16 airlines, was growing at twice the world average, and had produced a number of prominent aviation pioneers, including [[Lawrence Hargrave]], [[Harry Hawker]], [[Bert Hinkler]], [[Lawrence Wackett]], the Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]], [[Sidney Cotton]], [[Keith Virtue]] and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]]. Governments on both sides of politics, well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of Australia, regarded air transport as a matter of national importance (as did the governments of other geographically large nations, such as the Soviet Union and the United States). In the words of Director General of Civil Aviation [[AB Corbett]], <blockquote>\n''A nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation.''<ref name=\"Trans-AustraliaAirlinesMuseum_CorbettQuote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taamuseum.org.au/ANAC_Taa.htm|title=ANAC \u2013 Beginning of TAA|date=12 May 2009|accessdate=28 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308015241/http://www.taamuseum.org.au/ANAC_Taa.htm|archivedate=8 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n</blockquote> Air transport was encouraged both with direct subsidies and with mail contracts. Immediately before the start of the war, more than half of all airline passenger and freight miles were subsidised.\n\nHowever, after 1939 and especially after Japan's invasion of the islands to the north in 1941, civil aviation was sacrificed to military needs. By the end of the war, there were only nine domestic airlines remaining, eight smaller regional concerns and [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA), a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] owned by British and Australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85% of all government air transport subsidies.\n\nThe [[First Chifley Ministry|Chifley Government's]] view was summed up by Minister for Air, [[Arthur Drakeford]]: ''Where are the great pioneers of aviation?  .....  We discover that one by one the small pioneer enterprises are disappearing from the register. It is the inevitable process of absorption by a monopoly.''  Air transport, the government believed, was primarily a [[Public services|public service]], like hospitals, the railways or the post office. If there was to be a monopoly at all, then it should be one owned by the public and working in the public interest.\n\nIn August 1945, only two days after the end of [[World War II]], the [[Australian parliament]] passed the Australian National Airways Bill, which set up the Australian National Airways Commission (ANAC) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation's air transport industry. In keeping with the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government's [[socialist]] leanings, the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier. From this time on, it seemed, air transport in Australia would be a government monopoly. However, [[Australian National Airways Pty Ltd v Commonwealth|a legal challenge]], backed by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] opposition and business interests generally, was successful and in December 1945, the [[High Court]] ruled that the Commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies. The government could set up an airline if it wished, but it could not legislate a monopoly. Much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network, seeing it as a form of [[Nationalisation|socialisation]] by stealth.\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Trans-australia-airlines-skymaster.jpg|thumb|Trans-Australia Airlines [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|Skymaster]]]]\nWith the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions, the Australian National Airways Commission came into existence in February 1946. The commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers, including the director-general of civil aviation, the deputy director, a Labor party luminary and former member of the [[Commonwealth Bank]] board, the director-general of posts and telegraphs, and the assistant secretary of the Treasury. The commission was to be chaired by [[Arthur Coles]].\n\nColes was one of the richest men in Australia, and the co-founder of the [[Coles Group]]. By this time however, Coles had withdrawn from active management of the family business. He was 'a great believer in competition for business'<ref>Contested skies: Trans-Australian Airlines, Australian Airlines, 1946\u20131992\n By John Gunn, p 17</ref> and would not have accepted the post of Chairman of the ANAC had the monopoly provision been retained.\n\nThe Commission decided on the name \"Trans-Australia Airlines\", applied to the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury]] for a preliminary advance of \u00a310,000 and set about making plans, recruiting staff, and purchasing equipment. [[Reginald Ansett]], proprietor of the small Victorian company [[Ansett Australia|Ansett Airways]] was quick to offer to get the new airline off to a flying start by selling his entire operation to the ANAC as a going concern, including (if desired) his own services as managing agent.  The asking price, the Commission decided, was optimistic, and Ansett declined a more modest counter offer.\n\nThere was considerable correspondence between the Commission and Ivan Holyman, the Chairman of ANA, with a view to recruiting Holyman as General Manager of TAA at the princely salary of \u00a310,000 pa, and, when that offer was declined, of buying the near-monopoly airline outright.  Holyman was not willing to sell, nor to work for a government-owned body, but was interested in setting up a \"composite company\", the details of which proposal remained unclear.\n\nEventually the ANAC proceeded with the original plan, to build an airline from scratch. One of the first people hired was [[Lester Brain]], then operations manager at [[Qantas]]. Brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind Qantas' reputation for technical excellence. He applied for the advertised position of TAA Operations Manager, but to his surprise and delight, was instead offered an appointment as General Manager&nbsp;\u2014 though at \u00a33,000 pa, not the \u00a310,000 that had been offered to Holyman.\n[[File:TAA Douglas DC-3 BNE Wheatley.jpg|thumb|left|TAA [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Brisbane Airport]], early 1970s]]\nTAA acquired its first two aircraft in mid-June 1946, both [[Douglas DC-3]]s. A dozen more DC-3s would be added over the next few months, all ex-[[Royal Australian Air Force]] aircraft originally bought by the Australian Government under [[Lend-Lease|lend-lease]]. In July, the Treasury released \u00a3350,000 to allow TAA to order four larger, more modern [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]]s from [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] in the United States, and Brain appointed [[Aubrey Koch]] (from Qantas) as Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster and John Watkins as Chief Technical Officer. Watkins would become one of the key figures in TAA's success. His first task was to travel to the United States to accept delivery of the DC-4s. He later wrote:\n\n:''To my utter astonishment Arthur Coles, after the expected pep-talk about the DC-4 assignment, said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival, at a competitive price.''\n\nIt was typical of Coles, who knew nothing about aircraft, to reason that quality equipment would be vital, and then select the best man for the job of finding it and be prepared to back his judgement.\n\nAt this point, political considerations came to the fore again. TAA planned to start regular services on 7 October, but there was a [[1946 Australian federal election|federal election]] set for 28 September. Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] had been enormously popular during the darkest hours, but was voted out at the first post-war opportunity. There was no certainty that the Chifley Government would not be treated likewise, and the opposition was opposed to government ownership. Coles addressed the Commission at a meeting on 2 September 1946.\n\n: ''Gentlemen, the Government wants us to start services as soon as possible. There is a Federal election on 28 September. If we don't have an airline up and running by then and Labor loses the election there'll be no airline. We'll be out of a job. Any suggestions?''\n\nAfter some discussion it was agreed that the airline was not ready. It had a name, some excellent pilots, and some aircraft, but no ground facilities, no sales staff, no documentation, not even tickets. With a great deal of effort, it should be possible to make the planned start date of 7 October. With the discussion complete, Coles said:\n:''I have news for you. We start next Monday.''\n\nAfter a week of frantic effort hiring staff, borrowing a tin shed at the [[RAAF Williams|RAAF base at Laverton]] because [[Essendon Airport]] had been turned into mud by heavy rain, creating operations manuals, passenger manifests, tickets, and load sheets&nbsp;\u2014 even making passenger steps and baggage carts because there was no time to buy them in the ordinary way&nbsp;\u2014 Captains Hepburn and Nickels took off from Laverton at 5:45&nbsp;am bound for Sydney. TAA's first scheduled flight carried a full load of VIPs and just one paying passenger.\n\n===Rapid expansion===\n[[File:Fokker F.27-100 VH-TFF TAA ESS 24.09.70 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fokker Friendship]] Series 100 of TAA at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]] in 1970.]]\nThe subsequent few years led to massive growth for the new airline. As post-war austerity gave way to a more affluent era, Australians were able to travel by air in ever increasing numbers.\n\nMuch of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned [[Ansett Australia|Ansett-ANA]] and the government-supported TAA. A major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft. After initially utilising the venerable and readily available [[Douglas DC-3]], TAA was able to acquire the revolutionary pressurised [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 240]]. Popular with the travelling public because of its ability to fly above much of the weather, it was really this aircraft that established the airline's reputation for excellence and service reliability.\n\n[[File:Douglas DC-9-31 VH-TJN TAA ESS 12.04.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|TAA [[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-31]] ''[[Pawe\u0142 Strzelecki|Paul Strzelecki]]'' awaiting passengers at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]] in 1971, wearing the 1964-1969 ''Whispering T-Jet'' colour scheme used exclusively on DC-9s and [[Boeing 727]]s.]]\n\nEast-coast services were continually expanded and TAA soon earned its title as a true 'trans Australian' airline with services to [[Perth Airport|Perth]] on the west coast of the continent, using [[Douglas DC-4]] aircraft. [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprop aircraft were introduced in the 1950s and again proved immensely popular as a result of their smooth, vibration-free ride.\n\nAlthough government-owned, the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Liberal conservative government]] of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned Ansett and the requirements of TAA suffered as a result. The controversial [[Two Airlines Policy]] was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval.\n\nFlight numbers and schedules were strictly controlled, and TAA and Ansett-ANA invariably had flights departing airports for the same destination at exactly the same time with exactly the same equipment. The policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft (one from each airline) were required on their delivery flights to enter Australian airspace at exactly the same time.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lockheed L-188A VH-TLA TAA Essendon 30.01.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|TAA's first Lockheed Electra II four-engined turboprop airliner at Melbourne's [[Essendon Airport]], January 1971, wearing the 1960-1969 ''Jetliner'' colour scheme]]\nThe conservative government's benevolent attitude towards Ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced TAA to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop Viscount aircraft with Ansett-ANA in return for slower and older, piston-engined [[Douglas DC-6B]]s. In another instance, TAA had planned to re-equip with the revolutionary [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] pure-jet but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs, both airlines were required to purchase the Ansett preference: the less advanced turbo-prop [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]].\n\nNonetheless the Electra proved a reliable aircraft and TAA continuously grew and prospered. In the 1960s it introduced [[Boeing 727-100]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] ''Whispering T-Jets'' on primary routes as well as [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] ''Jetliner'' turboprops on regional routes.\n\nBy the late 1960s it had a massive network criss-crossing the continent, as well as an internal network within [[Papua New Guinea]] and flights from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to [[Baucau]] in [[Portuguese Timor|Portuguese]] [[East Timor|Timor]]. At this time the airline's livery was the famous white '''''T''''' on a blue tail, referred to as ''The Look of the '70s''. One of the more memorable television advertisements of the period was the jingle ''\"Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly Friendly Way\"'', whose lyrics and music were a variation on the 1967 song ''[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up and Away]]'', written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline [[TWA]].\n\nFurther expansion occurred in the 1970s and larger [[Boeing 727|727-276s]] (simultaneously with Ansett) were acquired. Once again the terms of the introduction were restricted by the two-airline policy.\n\nThe policy was marginally relaxed in the early 1980s when TAA was able to introduce the [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B4]], whilst Ansett chose to purchase the [[Boeing 767]]. The A300 was a revolutionary aircraft at the time for the domestic airline industry, in that it was a wide-body (twin aisle) aircraft. It provided significant extra capacity on the trunk east coast network and to [[Perth Airport|Perth]]. In 1986, Trans-Australia Airlines was rebranded as 'Australian Airlines' and the kangaroo returned to its livery.  Its new image coincided with a very successful and popular television campaign: \"You Should See Us Now\", \"Face To Face\" and \"The Way We Do The Things We Do\" became the carrier's new theme songs.\n\n=== Rebranding ===\n[[File:Australian Airlines Boeing 727-276 at Brisbane.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Boeing 727]] at [[Brisbane Airport]] in March 1992]]\nIn 1986, after a change of airline management, the name Trans-Australia Airlines was controversially dropped, in favour of '''Australian Airlines'''. Associated with this image change was a new livery for the airlines' aircraft, which wore the title ''Australian''.\n\nAustralian Airlines was the travel sponsor for the television shows ''[[Neighbours]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australia)|Wheel of Fortune]] and [[Sale of the Century]]'' between late 1987 and 1994.\n\nBetween 1980 and the merger with Qantas, selected teams participating in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] bore both Trans Australian Airlines (TAA) and Australian Airlines insignia, and from 1985 to 1990 the [[Seven Network]] commentary team used the airline to travel between the states to attend the various racing venues.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the government began to move towards deregulation of domestic aviation. (Deregulation took effect in October 1990.<ref>http://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/1995/files/is_006.pdf</ref>) A by-product of this impending change was the [[1989 Australian pilots' dispute]]. As the result of prolonged wage suppression, this dispute saw the resignation of the majority of Australian Airlines' aircrew and the basic structure of the airline was changed forever. The [[Hawke Government|Hawke cabinet]] not only encouraged the airline companies to employ overseas \"strike breakers\" but went even further, opting to pay the newly employed pilots from the public purse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/cabinet-papers-198889-pilots-strike-orbital-engine-pow-pension-big-brother-20150101-12ghx5.html|title=Cabinet papers 1988-89: pilots' strike; orbital engine; POW pension; Big Brother|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=1 January 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\n===Downturn===\nThe early 1990s changed the face of Australian domestic air travel. The Federal Government, although technically having deregulated the domestic aviation sector, made it effectively impossible for new entrant [[Compass Airlines (Australia)|Compass Airlines]] to succeed. In 1987, the [[Second Hawke Ministry|Hawke Government]] announced that the then government-owned domestic air terminals would be effectively privatised and leased to the two domestic airlines. Compass, a threat to the TAA/Ansett duopoly, was granted severely limited access to terminal facilities. At [[Sydney Airport]] both major airlines had effectively been given freehold ownership of their two separate terminals. The [[Federal Airports Corporation]] later purchased the Ansett terminal when it went broke in 2002. Any third airline operating there had to make do with the regional airline facilities. At other airports the two airlines had leased mostly empty terminals and installed all operational furnishings themselves. The airport authorities eagerly accepted lease money from Compass while providing almost no space in their terminals.\n\nThe ambitious new airline was allocated by the government what were clearly the worst gates, in the least desirable sections of domestic terminals across the country (in some cases, Atco huts were used) and had to operate from the international terminal at [[Perth Airport]]. As the result of liens placed over the Compass aircraft (due to alleged non-payment of airways expenses), the government's Civil Aviation Authority effectively caused the shutting down of Compass on 20 December 1991, 5 days before what would have been the immensely profitable Christmas travel period.<ref>[[Airservices Australia v Canadian Airlines International Ltd]]</ref> A seemingly well-orchestrated plan saw the Compass aircraft quickly flown out of the country and, with them, potentially the demise of a truly deregulated domestic aviation sector.\n\nAnsett and TAA/Australian were the sole remaining players, in effect a de facto two-airline policy yet again. Throughout this period of transformation and deregulation, Australian Airlines continued its successful run by posting healthy profits, increasing passenger loads and gained much favour from its catchy television commercials.  Although the merger with Qantas was seen as inevitable to give the latter a domestic network \u2014 and revive its bottom line \u2014 many former staff of Australian Airlines (TAA) and the general public mourned the loss of this iconic Australian brand.\n\n===Acquisition by Qantas===\nAlthough Compass was controversially and perhaps inevitably forced out of business, Australian's days, and those of Ansett, were numbered: the decision had been made at Federal Government level to offer both government-owned carriers (Qantas and Australian) for sale. Australian Airlines was offered first but was quickly snapped up by Qantas, which offered $400m to purchase the domestic carrier. Qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network; subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float, after selling a cornerstone 25% stake to British Airways, thus returning Qantas to the stock market after being absent from listing since 1947.\n\n[[Qantas]] acquired Australian Airlines on 14 September 1992,<ref name=\"qantas history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/history-expanding/global/en|title=Expanding Overseas...and at Home - Qantas|website=www.qantas.com.au|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> in preparation for its closure on 30 April 1994.<ref>Reid, Gordon. \"Major Airline Directory\", ''Australian Aviation'' magazine No. 96, May 1994, p72-82.

The sole remaining Australian Airlines brand identity \u2013 The Australian Way (inflight) magazine \u2013 was rebranded as The Qantas Magazine in 2016.\n\n===Rebirth===\nIn October 2002, Qantas revived the [[Australian Airlines]] brand as a full-service carrier, targeting the low-cost leisure market and flying primarily out of [[Cairns]] and [[Bali]]. This airline was disbanded in 2006 and its assets were absorbed back into the Qantas group.<ref name=\"qantas history\" />\n\n===TAA Museum===\nQantas currently allocates space at its Airport West Training Facility (formerly the TAA/Australian Airlines Flight Training Centre) for ''The TAA Museum''. The museum displays artifacts from the life of TAA/Australian including service ware, uniforms, advertisements and photographs and is open to the public during the week.  The museum is immensely popular with former staff and the travelling public and is run by a dedicated group of volunteers.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:TAA A300B4 VH-TAD Eagle Farm 1988.JPG|thumb|The nose section of an Australian Airlines [[Airbus A300]] in TAA colours at [[Eagle Farm Airport]], 1988]]\n[[File:Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport at dawn 19th June 1987.jpg|thumb|An Australian Airlines [[Boeing 737-300]] at a gate at [[Sydney Airport]], with a company [[Airbus A300]] in the background, in TAA colors, 1987]]\nOver the years, the airline operated the following aircraft types:\n{{Expand list|date=November 2011}}\n{| class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Introduced\n!Retired\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Airbus A300]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/Trans+Australia.htm|title=Trans Australia Fleet -  Airfleets aviation|website=www.airfleets.net|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Australia Airlines fleet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/Australian+Airlines.htm|title=Australian Airlines Fleet -  Airfleets aviation|website=www.airfleets.net|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n|<center>1981</center>\n|<center>1993</center>\n|[[Wide-body aircraft]].
