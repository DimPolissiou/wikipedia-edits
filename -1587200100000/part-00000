In recognition of his public service, he was appointed [[CBE]] by the Queen in the New Year Honours List 2009.<ref name=\"BBC_CBE\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/7805364.stm|title=Social Campaigner appointed CBE|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n== A Post-Capitalist and Post-Socialist Approach to Public Policy ==\n\nSchluter\u2019s approach to public policy was first articulated at book length in ''The R Factor''(1993), co-authored with the writer, David Lee. \n\nThe central argument of the book is that social, economic and political problems in society arise from a lack of prioritization of relationships \u2013 not only personal, but organisational, national and international. All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Relational Thinking\u2019\u2019\u2019 is\n\n* A social philosophy, a broad-based inclusive framework of thinking, explored and developed by Dr Michael Schluter\n* A framework based on the relational values of the Judaeo-Christian tradition as its origins lie in reflection on the biblical social vision.\n* A framework which promotes the idea that all areas of public and private life can and should be seen not just through the financial and economic lenses but through the lens of relationships because it is through strong and resilient relationships that development and cohesion of organisations and communities, and personal well-being and health, are realised.\n* A body of thought that answers important questions about the goals of national life, the purpose of institutions, and lifestyle issues, and the way in which these purposes and goals can be best achieved.\n\nSome Key features of Relational Thinking:\n\n* All public policies and decisions by organisations should be assessed for their contribution to the relational health of those directly involved and of the wider community.\n* A fresh understanding of the way relationships work, called Relational Proximity which explores the effects of communication, time, information, power and purpose on the way inter-personal and inter-organisational relationships are formed and assessed.\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and ethos, the institutional structure and work practices of:\no The education sector o The health sector o The criminal justice sector o The business sector\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and purposes of national development and how it should be measured/assessed, and in particular a fresh understanding of the meaning of development in the context of hi- and low-income countries.\n* A radical critique of the structure of the public limited company and proposals for their re-engineering.\n\nSome initatives putting Relational Thinking into practice:\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated.\n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.

Ten years later, this led to the publication of '''''The 'R' Factor''''' in 1993.

All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Relational Thinking\u2019\u2019\u2019 is\n\n* A social philosophy, a broad-based inclusive framework of thinking, explored and developed by Dr Michael Schluter\n* A framework based on the relational values of the Judaeo-Christian tradition as its origins lie in reflection on the biblical social vision.\n* A framework which promotes the idea that all areas of public and private life can and should be seen not just through the financial and economic lenses but through the lens of relationships because it is through strong and resilient relationships that development and cohesion of organisations and communities, and personal well-being and health, are realised.\n* A body of thought that answers important questions about the goals of national life, the purpose of institutions, and lifestyle issues, and the way in which these purposes and goals can be best achieved.\n\nSome Key features of Relational Thinking:\n\n* All public policies and decisions by organisations should be assessed for their contribution to the relational health of those directly involved and of the wider community.\n* A fresh understanding of the way relationships work, called Relational Proximity which explores the effects of communication, time, information, power and purpose on the way inter-personal and inter-organisational relationships are formed and assessed.\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and ethos, the institutional structure and work practices of:\no The education sector o The health sector o The criminal justice sector o The business sector\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and purposes of national development and how it should be measured/assessed, and in particular a fresh understanding of the meaning of development in the context of hi- and low-income countries.\n* A radical critique of the structure of the public limited company and proposals for their re-engineering.\n\nSome initatives putting Relational Thinking into practice:\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated.\n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.

She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 17 February 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Ray C. Needham, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 13 June 1969 with [[Commander]] Billy F. Tally in command.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1969-1984===\n\nShip's Motto: \"Invisible, Invulnerable, Invincible\"\n\nBERGALL is the second submarine to bear the name.  The first was built by Electric Boat in 1944.  During World War II, SS 320 made five war patrols and sank or damaged over 100,000 tons of enemy shipping.  This is the reason for there being five stars on the SSN 667 Ship's Crest.\n\nThe USS Bergall (SSN 667) was a STURGEON Class, especially designed as an anti-submarine weapon. Her keel was laid on 4 April 1966 and she was launched 17 February 1968. After completion of her sea trials she was commissioned on 13 June 1969. She became the 84th nuclear submarine to enter the Fleet and the 43rd attack type. Her assignment upon commissioning was to Submarine Development Group Two in Groton, Connecticut. This assignment was to fully test the Navy's newest all-purpose sonar, the AN/BQS-13.\n\nIn 1970 Bergall became the first submarine to undergo the MK-48 torpedo conversion and in 1971 she was the first ship to carry the MK-48 torpedo in its operational warshot configuration. The AN/BQQ-5 digital sonar system was temporarily installed for test and evaluation in 1972. Bergall was awarded her first Navy Unit Commendation that year for her performance in the testing of the sonar systems and outstanding MK-48 torpedo proficiency.\nBERGALL has earned the Navy Unit Commendation (twice), Meritorious Unit Commendation (Four times), and numerous Battle Efficiency (\"E\"), Anti-submarine Warfare (\"A\"), Weapons Proficiency (\"E\"), Damage Control (\"DC\") and Communications (\"C\").\n\nBERGALL was twice awarded the Commander, Sixth Fleet \"Hook 'Em\" award during deployment to the Mediterranean in 1977 and 1982.\n\nBERGALL Appeared in three movies \u2013 \"The Submarine\", \"Topside Safety\" and episode 3 of the British TV series [[Sailor (TV series)|''Sailor'']] . In Sailor a medical evacuation from BERGALL was undertaken by a helicopter from the British Aircraft Carrier \n[[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']]\n\nBERGALL was the first east -coast submarine to carry a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV).\n\nBERGALL completed 14 deployments and various exercises and operations vital to the national security of the United States.\n\n1983 Deployed on North Atlantic Patrol for 3 months.\n\n1983 Upon return to Norfolk, VA, SUBRON 6, she immediately resupplied then got underway for a second North Atlantic Patrol taking the billet left vacant by another sub, unable to leave the pier due to engineering difficulties.\n\nSummer 1984 Complement of ships divers is made ready with qualification of crew members Matthew Cronley MM1SSDV, Curt Escher RM2SSDV and David Finch ET2SSDV.\n\nOctober 1984 CDR Steven V. Mladineo turns over command to CDR Stephen Gibbs.\n\nJanuary 1985 Deployed for the North Atlantic then after refit at Holy Loch, Scotland sailed for the Mediterranean where she performed several patrols in support of 6th fleet operations.\n\nApril 1985 Refit Sardinia, Italy then returned to operations in support of the 6th fleet.\n\nJune 1985 Bergall returned home to SUBRON 6 Norfolk, VA after 6 months away.\n\nShe was inactivated on 4 August 1995 and decommissioned 6 June 1996. She served with pride.  2016 is the 20th anniversary of decommissioning\n\n===Collision with USS ''Kittiwake'' (ASR-13), 1984 ===\nOn 23 April 1984, the [[submarine rescue vessel]] {{USS|Kittiwake|ASR-13}} collided with ''Bergall'' at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], while ''Bergall'' was moored to the [[pier]] [[aft]] of ''Kittiwake''. ''Kittiwake'' was getting underway for the first time since she had undergone maintenance, during which her main drive motor was re-wired improperly, causing it and the [[Propeller (marine)|screw]] it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]].  This was unknown to ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s bridge personnel, who found that ''Kittiwake'' started to drift aft when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the motor drive speed in order to correct it and get ''Kittiwake'' moving forward, but unwittingly caused ''Kittiwake'' to move further aft and at a higher speed.  Still not realizing that ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s main drive motor operating in reverse of what they expected, ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s bridge personnel then ordered another increase in ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern.

She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 17 February 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Ray C. Needham, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 13 June 1969 with [[Commander]] Billy F. Tally in command.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1969-1984===\n\nShip's Motto: \"Invisible, Invulnerable, Invincible\"\n\nBERGALL is the second submarine to bear the name.  The first was built by Electric Boat in 1944.  During World War II, SS 320 made five war patrols and sank or damaged over 100,000 tons of enemy shipping.  This is the reason for there being five stars on the SSN 667 Ship's Crest.\n\nThe USS Bergall (SSN 667) was a STURGEON Class, especially designed as an anti-submarine weapon. Her keel was laid on 4 April 1966 and she was launched 17 February 1968. After completion of her sea trials she was commissioned on 13 June 1969. She became the 84th nuclear submarine to enter the Fleet and the 43rd attack type. Her assignment upon commissioning was to Submarine Development Group Two in Groton, Connecticut. This assignment was to fully test the Navy's newest all-purpose sonar, the AN/BQS-13.\n\nIn 1970 Bergall became the first submarine to undergo the MK-48 torpedo conversion and in 1971 she was the first ship to carry the MK-48 torpedo in its operational warshot configuration. The AN/BQQ-5 digital sonar system was temporarily installed for test and evaluation in 1972. Bergall was awarded her first Navy Unit Commendation that year for her performance in the testing of the sonar systems and outstanding MK-48 torpedo proficiency.\nBERGALL has earned the Navy Unit Commendation (twice), Meritorious Unit Commendation (Four times), and numerous Battle Efficiency (\"E\"), Anti-submarine Warfare (\"A\"), Weapons Proficiency (\"E\"), Damage Control (\"DC\") and Communications (\"C\").\n\nBERGALL was twice awarded the Commander, Sixth Fleet \"Hook 'Em\" award during deployment to the Mediterranean in 1977 and 1982.\n\nBERGALL Appeared in three movies \u2013 \"The Submarine\", \"Topside Safety\" and episode 3 of the British TV series [[Sailor (TV series)|''Sailor'']] . In Sailor a medical evacuation from BERGALL was undertaken by a helicopter from the British Aircraft Carrier \n[[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']]\n\nBERGALL was the first east -coast submarine to carry a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV).\n\nBERGALL completed 14 deployments and various exercises and operations vital to the national security of the United States.\n\n1983 Deployed on North Atlantic Patrol for 3 months.\n\n1983 Upon return to Norfolk, VA, SUBRON 6, she immediately resupplied then got underway for a second North Atlantic Patrol taking the billet left vacant by another sub, unable to leave the pier due to engineering difficulties.\n\nSummer 1984 Complement of ships divers is made ready with qualification of crew members Matthew Cronley MM1SSDV, Curt Escher RM2SSDV and David Finch ET2SSDV.\n\nOctober 1984 CDR Steven V. Mladineo turns over command to CDR Stephen Gibbs.\n\nJanuary 1985 Deployed for the North Atlantic then after refit at Holy Loch, Scotland sailed for the Mediterranean where she performed several patrols in support of 6th fleet operations.\n\nApril 1985 Refit Sardinia, Italy then returned to operations in support of the 6th fleet.\n\nJune 1985 Bergall returned home to SUBRON 6 Norfolk, VA after 6 months away.\n\nShe was inactivated on 4 August 1995 and decommissioned 06/06/1996. She served with pride.  2016 is the 20th anniversary of decommissioning\n\n===Collision with USS ''Kittiwake'' (ASR-13), 1984 ===\nOn 23 April 1984, the [[submarine rescue vessel]] {{USS|Kittiwake|ASR-13}} collided with ''Bergall'' at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], while ''Bergall'' was moored to the [[pier]] [[aft]] of ''Kittiwake''. ''Kittiwake'' was getting underway for the first time since she had undergone maintenance, during which her main drive motor was re-wired improperly, causing it and the [[Propeller (marine)|screw]] it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]].  This was unknown to ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s bridge personnel, who found that ''Kittiwake'' started to drift aft when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the motor drive speed in order to correct it and get ''Kittiwake'' moving forward, but unwittingly caused ''Kittiwake'' to move further aft and at a higher speed.  Still not realizing that ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s main drive motor operating in reverse of what they expected, ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s bridge personnel then ordered another increase in ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern.  This continued until ''Kittiwake''{{'}}s [[stern]] backed into ''Bergall''{{'}}s [[sonar]] dome.\n\n==Decommissioning and disposal==\n''Bergall'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 6 June 1996 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 6 June 1997. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], was completed on 29 September 1997.\n\n== References ==\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/b/bergall-ii.html}}\n*{{NVR|{{NVR url|id=SSN667}}}}\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08667.htm NavSource Online: Submarine Photo Archive Bergall (SSN-667)]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bergall.org/ USS Bergall Association]\n\n{{Sturgeon class submarine}}\n{{1984 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bergall (Ssn-667)}}\n[[Category:Ships built in Groton, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Sturgeon-class submarines]]\n[[Category:Cold War submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Nuclear submarines of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:1968 ships]]\n[[Category:United States submarine accidents]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1984]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bergall_(SSN-667)"}

''Latin Grammar'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860199-9}}, p. 3</ref> Both classical and present practice is to write the letters separately, but the ligature was used in medieval and early modern writings, in part because ''\u00e6'' was reduced to the simple vowel {{IPA-lat|e|}} during the [[Roman Empire]]. In some medieval scripts, the ligature was simplified to ''\u0119'', an ''e'' with [[ogonek]], the ''[[e caudata]]''.

In Norwegian, there are four ways of pronouncing the letter:\n\n* {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} as in {{lang|no|\u00e6}} (the name of the letter), {{lang|no|b\u00e6r}}, {{lang|no|[[Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r|Solskj\u00e6r]]}}, {{lang|no|l\u00e6ring}}, {{lang|no|\u00e6ra}}, {{lang|no|\u00c6nes}}, {{lang|no|\u00e6rlig}}, {{lang|no|t\u00e6rne}}, {{lang|no|[[Kv\u00e6rner]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Bj\u00f8rn D\u00e6hlie|D\u00e6hlie]]}}, {{lang|no|s\u00e6rs}}, {{lang|no|\u00e6rfugl}}, {{lang|no|l\u00e6rt}}, {{lang|no|tr\u00e6r}} (\"trees\")\n* {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} as in {{lang|no|f\u00e6rre}}, {{lang|no|\u00e6sj}}, {{lang|no|n\u00e6rmere}}, {{lang|no|F\u00e6rder}}, {{lang|no|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8}},  {{lang|no|\u00e6rverdig}}, {{lang|da|v\u00e6rt}}, {{lang|da|l\u00e6rd}}, {{lang|da|Br\u00e6in}} (where {{lang|da|\u00e6i}} is pronounced as a diphthong {{IPA|/\u00e6i/}})\n* {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} as in {{lang|no|S\u00e6ther}}, {{lang|no|N\u00e6ser}}, {{lang|no|S\u00e6b\u00f8}}, {{lang|no|g\u00e6lisk}}, {{lang|no|sp\u00e6lsau}}, {{lang|no|bev\u00e6pne}}, {{lang|no|s\u00e6d}}, {{lang|no|\u00e6ser}}, {{lang|no|[[Hotel C\u00e6sar|C\u00e6sar]]}}, {{lang|no|v\u00e6te}}, {{lang|no|tr\u00e6r}} (\"thread(s)\" (verb))\n* {{IPA|/e/}} as in {{lang|no|S\u00e6th}}, {{lang|no|[[Naess|N\u00e6ss]]}}, {{lang|no|Br\u00e6nne}}, {{lang|no|[[Kjell B\u00e6kkelund|B\u00e6kkelund]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Knut Volleb\u00e6k|Volleb\u00e6k]]}}, {{lang|no|v\u00e6ske}}, {{lang|no|tr\u00e6dd}}\n\n[[File:Denmark-gender.png|thumb|150px|West of the red line, classic [[Danish dialects]] use {{lang|da|\u00e6}} as the [[definite article]].]]\nIn many western, northern and southwestern Norwegian dialects and in the western Danish dialects of {{lang|da|[[Thy (district)|Thy]]|italic=no}} and [[Southern Jutland]], {{lang|da|\u00e6}} has a significant meaning: the first person singular pronoun [[I (pronoun)|I]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} It is thus a normal spoken word and is usually written {{lang|da|\u00e6}} when such dialects are rendered in writing.\n\nIn western and southern [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]] dialects of Danish, {{lang|da|\u00e6}} is also the [[proclitic]] [[definite article]]: {{lang|da|\u00e6 hus}} (the house), as opposed to [[Danish language#Dialects|Standard Danish]] and all other Nordic varieties which have en[[clitic]] definite articles (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian: {{lang|da|huset}}, Icelandic, Faroese: {{lang|is|h\u00fasi\u00f0}} (the house)). The dialects are rarely committed to writing, except for some dialect literature.\n\nThe equivalent letter in [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is {{lang|de|\u00e4}}, but it is not located at the same place within the alphabet. In German, it is not a separate letter from \"A\" but in Swedish, it is the second-last letter (between \u00e5 and \u00f6).\n\nIn the normalised spelling of [[Middle High German]], {{lang|gmh|\u00e6}} represents a long vowel {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}. The actual spelling in the manuscripts varies, however.\n\n==Ossetic==\n[[File:Oseta latina skribo.jpg|frame|right|[[Ossetian language|Ossetic]] Latin script; part of a page from a book published in 1935]]\n\n[[Ossetian language|Ossetic]] used the letter ''\u00e6'' when it was written using the Latin script from 1923 to 1938. Since then, Ossetian has used a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]] with an identical-looking letter ([[\u04d4|\u04d4 and \u04d5]]). It is pronounced as a mid-central vowel ([[schwa]]).\n\n==South American languages==\nThe letter ''\u00e6'' is used in the official orthography of [[Kaw\u00e9sqar language|Kaw\u00e9sqar]] spoken in [[Chile]] and also in that of the [[Fuegian languages|Fuegian language]] [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]].\n\n== International Phonetic Alphabet ==\nThe symbol {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} is also used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] to denote a [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] like in the word ''cat'' in many dialects of Modern English, which is the sound that was most likely represented by the Old English letter. In the IPA, it is always in [[lowercase]].\n\n==Uralic Phonetic Alphabet==\nThe [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] (UPA) uses several additional \u00e6-related symbols:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02141-n2419-uralic-phonetic.pdf|title=L2/02-141: Uralic Phonetic Alphabet characters for the UCS|date=2002-03-20|first1=Michael|last1=Everson|authorlink1=Michael Everson|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n*{{Unichar|1D01|LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL AE}}\n*{{Unichar|1D02|LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED AE}}\n*{{Unichar|1D2D|MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL AE}}\n*{{Unichar|1D46|MODIFIER LETTER SMALL TURNED AE}}\n\n== Computer encodings and entering==\n[[File:Illuminated keyboard 2.JPG|thumb|right|Danish keyboard with keys for \u00c6, \u00d8 and \u00c5.<br/>On Norwegian keyboards the \u00c6 and \u00d8 trade places.]]\n\n[[File:Left side of modern US-International keyboard.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The \u00c6 character (among others, including [[\u00c5]] and [[\u00f8]]) is accessible using [[AltGr]]+z on a [[US-International]] keyboard]]\n\n* When using the [[Latin-1]] or [[Unicode]]/[[HTML]] character sets, the code points for ''\u00c6'' and ''\u00e6'' are {{unichar|00C6|LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE|html=}} and {{unichar|00E6|LATIN SMALL LETTER AE|html=}}, respectively.\n*The characters can be entered by holding the [[Alt key]] while typing in 0198 (upper case) or 0230 (lower case) on the number pad on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems (the Alt key and 145 for \u00e6 or 146 for \u00c6 may also work from the legacy [[IBM437]] codepage).\n*In the [[TeX]] typesetting system, ''\u04d5'' is produced by \\ae.\n*In [[Microsoft Word]], ''\u00c6'' or ''\u00e6'' can be written using the key combination {{key|CTRL}} + {{key|SHIFT}} + {{key|&}} followed by {{key|A}} or {{key|a}}.\n*On [[US-International]] keyboards, \u00c6 is accessible with the combination of [[AltGr]]+z.\n*In [[X Window System|X]], [[AltGr]]+A is often mapped to \u00e6/\u00c6, or a [[Compose key]] sequence Compose + a + e can be used.

Marching out from Mecca towards Medina on 10 December 624 [[Common Era|CE]], the Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back at Muhammad and his followers. The Muslims readied for war soon afterwards and the two armies fought on the slopes and plains of Mount Uhud.\n\nAlthough outnumbered, the Muslims gained the early initiative and forced the Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by a part of the Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim [[Archery|archers]], who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan [[cavalry]], led by Meccan war veteran [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.\n\nFor the Muslims, the battle was a significant setback. Although they had been close to routing the Meccans a second time, their breach of Muhammad's orders in favor of collecting Meccan spoils reaped severe consequences. The two armies would meet again in 627 CE at the [[Battle of the Trench]].<ref name=\"CHI\">Cambridge History of Islam 1A (1977) pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nMuhammad had preached the religion of [[Islam]] in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition from the rest of the Quraish, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as ''Yathrib''; Medina means ''City''). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to [[Damascus]] which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.<ref>Peters (1994) pp. 211\u2014214.</ref>\n\nMany Muslims considered this unexpected victory a proof that they had been favored by [[God in Islam|God]] and believed they were assured such victories in the future.<ref name=\"W1423\">Watt (1974) pp. 142\u2014143.</ref> A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the [[Jews|Jew]]ish tribe [[Banu Nadir]] and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.<ref>Watt (1974) pp. 132\u2014135.</ref>\n\nThe reason for the battle was to retaliate against the Muslims for the Battle of Badr.<ref name=\"Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 181\">Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 181.

Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them.<ref name=\"Uhud\">\"Uhud\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref><ref>Watt (1974) p. 135.</ref> According to the early Muslim historian [[Ibn Ishaq]], a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army to provide vocal support, including [[Hind bint Utbah]], his wife.<ref>Guillaume 813.</ref>\n\nA scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers late on Thursday, 20 December. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, and there was dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}\n\n==Encounter at Uhud==\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |size=\n |image1=|caption1=Map of the battle, showing the Muslim and Meccan lines respectively\n |image2=Jabal e Uhud.jpg |caption2=Mount Uhud seen from cemetery of Uhud martyrs\n |image3=The Message - Uhud archers.png |caption3=Muslim archers positioned on a hill during the Battle of Uhud, as depicted in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God (film)|The Message]]''\n}}\n\nA group of approximately 1,000 Muslim men set out on late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces.

Shortly before the battle commenced, '[[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]] (the chief of the [[Banu Khazraj|Khazraj]] tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans.

This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated on the east side of the Muslim camp.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Muhammad ordered the Muslim archers to never under any circumstances leave their positions on the hill unless ordered to do so by him only, he made this order very clear by uttering these words to the archers, \"If you saw us prevail and start to take spoils, do not come to assist us. And if you saw us get vanquished and birds eat from our heads, do not come to assist us.\"<ref>[http://www.amrkhaled.net/articles/articlesprint1767.htm Review: The lesson of Uhud defeat (in Arabic)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Meccan army positioned itself facing the Muslim lines, with the main body led by Abu Sufyan, and the left and right flanks commanded by [[Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl]] and Khalid ibn al-Walid respectively. [['Amr ibn al-'As]] was named the commander of cavalry and his task was to coordinate attack between the cavalry wings.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 258.</ref><ref name=\"W89\">Watt (1974) pp. 138\u2014139.</ref> They attacked with their initial charge led by the Medinan exile Abu \u2018Amir. Thwarted by a shower of stones from the Muslims, Abu \u2018Amir and his men were forced to retire and tend to the camps behind the Meccan lines. The Meccan [[standard-bearer]], Talhah ibn Abi Talhah al-\u2018Abdari, advanced and challenged the enemy to a [[duel]]. [[Ali]] ibn Abi Talib, the young cousin of Muhammad, rushed forth and struck Talhah down in a single blow. Talhah's brother, Uthman, ran forward to pick up the fallen banner \u2014 the Meccan women willing him on with songs and the loud beating of [[timbrel]]s. [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]] emerged from the Muslim ranks, bringing him to a similar fate as Talhah. It was their family that was responsible for the Meccan army's standard-bearing, and thus one by one, Talhah's brothers and sons went to retrieve the Meccan banner and fight unsuccessfully, until they all eventually perished.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 259.</ref> Following the duels, general engagement between the two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 260.</ref> Enjoying the best of these early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.<ref name=\"Uhud\" /><ref name=\"W89\" />\n\nAt this critical juncture, the Meccan cavalry led by Khalid ibn al-Walid exploited this move and attacked the remaining minority of Muslim archers who refused to disobey Muhammad's orders and were still positioned on the hill. From there, the Meccans were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear. Confusion ensued, and numerous Muslims were killed.<ref name=\"Uhud\" /><ref name=\"W89\" /> Most notably was Hamza, who had been thrown down in a surprise attack by the [[javelin]] of the [[Ethiopia]]n slave of Hind, [[Wahshi ibn Harb]]. While the Meccan riposte strengthened, rumors circulated that Muhammad too had perished. It emerged, however, that Muhammad had only been wounded\u2014due to missiles of stone which resulted in a gash on his forehead and lip. It is recorded that Ali ibn Abi Talib alone remained, fending off the assaults of Khalid's cavalrymen. According to Ibn Atheer, \"The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of Quraish from all sides. Ali attacked, in compliance with Muhammad's orders, every unit that made an attack upon him and dispersed them or killed some of them, and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp |title=History of Islam and Muslims, The second battle of Islam at Uhud, Battle of Ohod |last=Syed |first=Akramulla |date=14 December 2017 |website=Islamic Occasions |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref> After fierce hand-to-hand combat, most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased.

The Meccans retired for the evening at a place called ''[[Battle of Hamra al-Asad|Hamra al-Asad]]'', a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.<ref>See:\n* Watt (1981) p. 432;\n* An early Muslim historian, [[al-Waqidi]], records [['Amr ibn al-'As]] (a Meccan commander) as saying: {{Quote|When we renewed the attack against them, we smote a certain number of them, and they scattered in every direction, but later a party of them rallied.

They had expected another victory like at Badr, which was considered a sign of God's favor upon them. At Uhud, however, they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men.

This is when `Abdullah bin Abi Rabi`ah, `Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Umayyah and other men from Quraysh who lost their fathers, sons or brothers in Badr, went to Abu Sufyan bin Harb. They said to him, and to those among the Quraysh who had wealth in that caravan, `O people of Quraysh! Muhammad has grieved you and killed the chiefs among you. Therefore, help us with this wealth so that we can fight him, it may be that we will avenge our losses.' They agreed. Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"This Ayah was revealed about them, according to Ibn `Abbas,\n(Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth...) until,\n(they who are the losers.)\nMujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hakam bin `Uyaynah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Abza said that this Ayah was revealed about Abu Sufyan and his spending money in Uhud to fight the Messenger of Allah. Ad-Dahhak said that this Ayah was revealed about the idolators of Badr. In any case, the Ayah is general, even though there was a specific incident that accompanied its revelation. Allah states here that the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder from the path of truth. However, by doing that, their money will be spent and then will become a source of grief and anguish for them, availing them nothing in the least. They seek to extinguish the Light of Allah and make their word higher than the word of truth. However, Allah will complete His Light, even though the disbelievers hate it. He will give aid to His religion, make His Word dominant, and His religion will prevail above all religions. This is the disgrace that the disbelievers will taste in this life; and in the Hereafter, they will taste the torment of the Fire. Whoever among them lives long, will witness with his eyes and hear with his ears what causes grief to him. Those among them who are killed or die will be returned to eternal disgrace and the everlasting punishment.|Ibn Kathir on Quran 8:36<ref name=\"online\">Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c71ASjReLUkC&pg=PA226 Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 9 (Part 9): Al-A'Raf 88 to Al-Anfal 40], p. 226, MSA Publication Limited, 2009, {{ISBN|1861795750}}.

By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?\" 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"Have you forgotten what Allah's Apostle said to you?\" They replied, \"By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.\" But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated.

Accounts of the battle are derived mainly from descendants of the participants.

Marching out from Mecca towards Medina on 10 December 624 [[Common Era|CE]], the Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back at Muhammad and his followers. The Muslims readied for war soon afterwards and the two armies fought on the slopes and plains of Mount Uhud.\n\nAlthough outnumbered, the Muslims gained the early initiative and forced the Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by a part of the Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim [[Archery|archers]], who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan [[cavalry]], led by Meccan war veteran [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.\n\nFor the Muslims, the battle was a significant setback. Although they had been close to routing the Meccans a second time, their breach of Muhammad's orders in favor of collecting Meccan spoils reaped severe consequences. The two armies would meet again in 627 CE at the [[Battle of the Trench]].<ref name=\"CHI\">Cambridge History of Islam 1A (1977) pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nMuhammad had preached the religion of [[Islam]] in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition from the rest of the Quraish, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as ''Yathrib''; Medina means ''City''). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to [[Damascus]] which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.<ref>Peters (1994) pp. 211\u2014214.</ref>\n\nMany Muslims considered this unexpected victory a proof that they had been favored by [[God in Islam|God]] and believed they were assured such victories in the future.<ref name=\"W1423\">Watt (1974) pp. 142\u2014143.</ref> A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the [[Jews|Jew]]ish tribe [[Banu Nadir]] and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.<ref>Watt (1974) pp. 132\u2014135.</ref>\n\nThe reason for the battle was to retaliate against the Muslims for the Battle of Badr.<ref name=\"Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 181\">Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 181.

Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them.<ref name=\"Uhud\">\"Uhud\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref><ref>Watt (1974) p. 135.</ref> According to the early Muslim historian [[Ibn Ishaq]], a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army to provide vocal support, including [[Hind bint Utbah]], his wife.<ref>Guillaume 813.</ref>\n\nA scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers late on Thursday, 20 December. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, and there was dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}\n\n==Encounter at Uhud==\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |size=\n |image1=|caption1=Map of the battle, showing the Muslim and Meccan lines respectively\n |image2=Jabal e Uhud.jpg |caption2=Mount Uhud seen from cemetery of Uhud martyrs\n |image3=The Message - Uhud archers.png |caption3=Muslim archers positioned on a hill during the Battle of Uhud, as depicted in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God (film)|The Message]]''\n}}\n\nA group of approximately 1,000 Muslim men set out on late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took a position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, '[[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]] (the chief of the [[Banu Khazraj|Khazraj]] tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the [[Qur'an]] for this act.<ref name=\"W137\">Watt (1974) p. 137.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met, was with the leave of [[Allah]], in order that He might test the believers,-<br />And the Hypocrites also.

This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated on the east side of the Muslim camp.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Muhammad ordered the Muslim archers to never under any circumstances leave their positions on the hill unless ordered to do so by him only, he made this order very clear by uttering these words to the archers, \"If you saw us prevail and start to take spoils, do not come to assist us. And if you saw us get vanquished and birds eat from our heads, do not come to assist us.\"<ref>[http://www.amrkhaled.net/articles/articlesprint1767.htm Review: The lesson of Uhud defeat (in Arabic)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Meccan army positioned itself facing the Muslim lines, with the main body led by Abu Sufyan, and the left and right flanks commanded by [[Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl]] and Khalid ibn al-Walid respectively. [['Amr ibn al-'As]] was named the commander of cavalry and his task was to coordinate attack between the cavalry wings.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 258.</ref><ref name=\"W89\">Watt (1974) pp. 138\u2014139.</ref> They attacked with their initial charge led by the Medinan exile Abu \u2018Amir. Thwarted by a shower of stones from the Muslims, Abu \u2018Amir and his men were forced to retire and tend to the camps behind the Meccan lines. The Meccan [[standard-bearer]], Talhah ibn Abi Talhah al-\u2018Abdari, advanced and challenged the enemy to a [[duel]]. [[Ali]] ibn Abi Talib, the young cousin of Muhammad, rushed forth and struck Talhah down in a single blow. Talhah's brother, Uthman, ran forward to pick up the fallen banner \u2014 the Meccan women willing him on with songs and the loud beating of [[timbrel]]s. [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]] emerged from the Muslim ranks, bringing him to a similar fate as Talhah. It was their family that was responsible for the Meccan army's standard-bearing, and thus one by one, Talhah's brothers and sons went to retrieve the Meccan banner and fight unsuccessfully, until they all eventually perished.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 259.</ref> Following the duels, general engagement between the two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers.<ref>Muir; Weir (1912) p. 260.</ref> Enjoying the best of these early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.<ref name=\"Uhud\" /><ref name=\"W89\" />\n\nAt this critical juncture, the Meccan cavalry led by Khalid ibn al-Walid exploited this move and attacked the remaining minority of Muslim archers who refused to disobey Muhammad's orders and were still positioned on the hill. From there, the Meccans were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear. Confusion ensued, and numerous Muslims were killed.<ref name=\"Uhud\" /><ref name=\"W89\" /> Most notably was Hamza, who had been thrown down in a surprise attack by the [[javelin]] of the [[Ethiopia]]n slave of Hind, [[Wahshi ibn Harb]]. While the Meccan riposte strengthened, rumors circulated that Muhammad too had perished. It emerged, however, that Muhammad had only been wounded\u2014due to missiles of stone which resulted in a gash on his forehead and lip. It is recorded that Ali ibn Abi Talib alone remained, fending off the assaults of Khalid's cavalrymen. According to Ibn Atheer, \"The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of Quraish from all sides. Ali attacked, in compliance with Muhammad's orders, every unit that made an attack upon him and dispersed them or killed some of them, and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp |title=History of Islam and Muslims, The second battle of Islam at Uhud, Battle of Ohod |last=Syed |first=Akramulla |date=14 December 2017 |website=Islamic Occasions |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref> After fierce hand-to-hand combat, most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat.<ref>Ibn Ishaq (1955) 380\u2014388, cited in Peters (1994) p. 218.</ref> Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, [[Umar]] ibn al-Khattab),<ref>Ibn Ishaq records this exchange as follows:\n\n{{Quote|When (the Qurayshi leader) Abu Sufyan wanted to leave, he went to the top of the mountain and shouted loudly, saying, \"You have done a fine work. Victory in war goes by turns: today is in exchange for the day of Badr. Show your superiority, Hubal\", that is, vindicate your religion. The Messenger told Umar to go up and answer him and say, \"God is most high and most glorious. We are not equal: our dead are in paradise, yours are in hell.\" At this answer Abu Sufyan said to Umar, \"Come up here to me.\" The Messenger told him to go and see what Abu Sufyan was up to. When he came Abu Sufyan said, \"I adjure you by God, Umar, have we killed Muhammad?\" \"By God, you have not, he is listening to what you are saying right now\", Umar replied. Abu Sufyan said, \"I regard you as more truthful and reliable than Ibn Qami'a\", referring to the latter's claim that he had killed Muhammad.|cf.

Chase F. Robinson, writing in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', states the notion that \"the Muslims suffered a disheartening defeat is clear enough.\"<ref name=\"Uhud\" /> Other scholars such as [[William Montgomery Watt]] disagree, noting that while the Muslims did not win, the Meccans had failed to achieve their strategic aim of destroying Muhammad and his followers; and that the Meccans' untimely withdrawal indicated weakness on their part.<ref>See:\n* Cambridge History of Islam 1A (1977) pp. 47\u201448\n* Firestone (1999) p.132</ref> The battle is also noted for the emergence of the military leadership and tactical military genius of Khalid ibn al-Walid, who would later become the most famous of all [[Arab people|Arab]] generals during the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion era]], in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] held [[Syria (region)|Syria]].<ref>See:\n*Andrae; Menzel (1960) p. 150;\n*Nafziger; Walton (2000) pp. 16\u201318;\n*Watt (1974) p. 200</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib Grave at Uhud.jpg|thumb|Grave of [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]] near Mount Uhud]]\n\nMuhammad and the Muslims buried the dead on the battlefield, returning home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening at a place called ''[[Battle of Hamra al-Asad|Hamra al-Asad]]'', a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.<ref>See:\n* Watt (1981) p. 432;\n* An early Muslim historian, [[al-Waqidi]], records [['Amr ibn al-'As]] (a Meccan commander) as saying: {{Quote|When we renewed the attack against them, we smote a certain number of them, and they scattered in every direction, but later a party of them rallied. Quraysh then took counsel together and said, The victory is ours, let us depart. For we had heard that [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy|Ibn Ubayy]] had retired with a third of the force, and some of the [[Banu Aus|Aws]] and the [[Banu Khazraj|Khazraj]] had stayed away from the battle, and we were not sure that they would not attack us. Moreover we had a number of wounded, and all our horses had been wounded by the arrows. So they set off. We had not reached ar-Rawha until a number of them came against us and we continued on our way.|cited in Peters (1994) p. 219.}}</ref>\n\n===Muslim reaction===\nFor the Muslims, the battle held a religious dimension as well as a military one. They had expected another victory like at Badr, which was considered a sign of God's favor upon them. At Uhud, however, they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men. A verse of the Qur'an revealed soon after the battle cited the Muslims' disobedience and desire for loot as the cause for this setback:<ref name=\"CHI\" /><ref name=\"W144\">Watt (1974) p. 144.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe.|Qur'an, sura 3 (Al Imran), ayah 152<ref>{{cite quran|3|152|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, then, the misfortunes at Uhud \u2014 largely the result of the rear guard abandoning their position in order to seek booty \u2014 were partly a punishment and partly a test for steadfastness.<ref name=\"W144\" /> Firestone observes that such verses provided inspiration and hope to the Muslims, sacralizing future battles that they would experience. He adds that rather than demoralizing the Muslims, the battle seemed to reinforce the solidarity between them.<ref>Firestone (1999) p. 132.</ref>\n\n===Further conflict===\nAbu Sufyan, whose position as leader was no longer disputed{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}, set about forging alliances with surrounding [[nomad]]ic tribes in order to build up strength for another advance on Medina. The success of the Meccans' rousing of tribes against Muhammad reaped disastrous consequences for him and the Muslims with two main losses: one was where a Muslim party had been invited by a chieftain of the Ma'unah tribe, who were then killed as they approached by the tribe of [[Banu Sulaym|Sulaym]]; while the other was when the Muslims had sent out instructors to a tribe which stated it wanted to convert to Islam \u2014 the instructors had been led into an ambush by the guides of the would-be Muslim tribe, and were subsequently killed.<ref>Watt (1974) pp. 147\u2014148.</ref> Soon thereafter, Muhammad became convinced that the [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Jewish tribe]] Banu Nadir harbored enmity towards him and were plotting to kill him. The Banu Nadir were expelled from Medina after a fifteen-day siege, with some relocating to the oasis of [[Khaybar]] and others to Syria.<ref>Nadir, Banu-l.

This is when `Abdullah bin Abi Rabi`ah, `Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Umayyah and other men from Quraysh who lost their fathers, sons or brothers in Badr, went to Abu Sufyan bin Harb. They said to him, and to those among the Quraysh who had wealth in that caravan, `O people of Quraysh! Muhammad has grieved you and killed the chiefs among you. Therefore, help us with this wealth so that we can fight him, it may be that we will avenge our losses.' They agreed. Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"This Ayah was revealed about them, according to Ibn `Abbas,\n(Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth...) until,\n(they who are the losers.)\nMujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hakam bin `Uyaynah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Abza said that this Ayah was revealed about Abu Sufyan and his spending money in Uhud to fight the Messenger of Allah. Ad-Dahhak said that this Ayah was revealed about the idolators of Badr. In any case, the Ayah is general, even though there was a specific incident that accompanied its revelation. Allah states here that the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder from the path of truth. However, by doing that, their money will be spent and then will become a source of grief and anguish for them, availing them nothing in the least. They seek to extinguish the Light of Allah and make their word higher than the word of truth. However, Allah will complete His Light, even though the disbelievers hate it. He will give aid to His religion, make His Word dominant, and His religion will prevail above all religions. This is the disgrace that the disbelievers will taste in this life; and in the Hereafter, they will taste the torment of the Fire. Whoever among them lives long, will witness with his eyes and hear with his ears what causes grief to him. Those among them who are killed or die will be returned to eternal disgrace and the everlasting punishment.|Ibn Kathir on Quran 8:36<ref name=\"online\">Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c71ASjReLUkC&pg=PA226 Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 9 (Part 9): Al-A'Raf 88 to Al-Anfal 40], p. 226, MSA Publication Limited, 2009, {{ISBN|1861795750}}.

He instructed them, \"Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.\" Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?\" 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"Have you forgotten what Allah's Apostle said to you?\" They replied, \"By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.\" But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Apostle in their rear was calling them back.

The general sequence of the events gained consensus early on, as demonstrated in the text of Ibn Ishaq, an early biographer of Muhammad. Accounts of the battle are derived mainly from descendants of the participants. Much of the basic narrative and chronology, according to Robinson, is reasonably authentic, although some of the more elaborate details \u2014 such as the exact scale of the Muslim defeat \u2014 may be doubtful or difficult to ascertain.<ref name=\"Uhud\" />\n\n===Names of the Muslims killed===\n[[Ibn al-Athir]] gives the names of 85 Muslims killed in the battle of Uhud. Of these, 75 were Medinans (43 from the [[Banu Khazraj]] and 32 from the [[Banu Aws]]) and 10 were [[Muhajirun]] (Emigrants) from Mecca.

It is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] for most people, causing gastrointestinal upset, but can be eaten by some without apparent negative effect.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species was first officially defined under the name ''Agaricus xanthodermus'' in 1876 by L\u00e9on Gaston Genevier, in a letter published in the bulletin of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France|French Botanical Society]].<ref name=SBF/><ref name=IndexFungorum/>  Genevier described the ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms commonly eaten (perhaps sometimes inadvisedly) in the region of [[Nantes]], and attempted to clarify the distinctions between them. He proposed a detailed reclassification into 5 species, including this new one. Apparently up until that time, these yellow-staining mushrooms were considered to be just varieties of other species which are edible: ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'', ''[http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=508604 A. edulis]'', and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]''.<ref name=Genevier/>\n\nThe epithet ''xanthodermus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for \"yellow\" and \"skin\", which were then given a Latin adjective ending. This is the official name, but the form ''Agaricus xanthoderma'' is also often seen.<ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/><ref name=Moser/>  In the latter name, ''-derma'' \"skin\" is a neuter noun which does not have to agree in gender with ''Agaricus'', and so this form is legal according to the rules of botanical nomenclature.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:2011-10-13 Agaricus xanthodermus Genev 181971.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is generally {{convert|6|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, though can reach {{convert|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is initially convex, with some young specimens having a squarish shape, though flattening with age. It is whitish, with light brown tints towards the centre. The cap is dry and smooth, but can be scaly when old. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of this mushroom progress from pale-pink to a chocolate color. The spore print is brown. Its white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous with a skirt-like ring. Microscopically, the [[Cystidium|cheilocystidia]] are club-shaped. The spores are 6\u20137\u00d73\u20134&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].\n\nThe main identifying feature is an immediate bright yellow colouration on cutting through the base of the stem, or scraping the flesh; later, the affected area fades to a dull brown. Numerous edible ''Agaricus'' species, such as ''[[Agaricus augustus|A. augustus]]'', ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]'', turn yellow to a greater or lesser extent, but they do not display such an intense reaction.\n[[File:Karbol-Champignion2.png|thumb|left|After cooking, intense color change to yellow occurs and the smell of [[Phenol]] becomes very intense.]]\n\n''Agaricus xanthodermus'' has an unpleasant characteristic smell, which is phenolic, reminiscent of ink or [[carbolic soap]].

It occurs in woods, lawns, gardens and hedgerows in autumn. This is a [[saprobic]] species.\n\n==Poisonous character==\nIt appears that some people can eat this mushroom without ill effects,<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Genevier/><ref name=Jordan/> but it can cause serious gastric problems. It is indigestible and gives rise to symptoms of sweating, flushing, and severe stomach cramps.<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Bon/><ref name=Jordan/>\n\nOf those who gather ''Agaricus''-style mushrooms, about 50% of the cases of poisoning are from this species.
