Thus companies were created - e.g. \"The Cricket of \u00cele-de-France\" and \"The Castors of Bi\u00e8vre\". In 1953, the ''Company of Counters'' of [[Montrouge]] which had [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]]s at Antony (located behind the square Marc Sangnier on the border with Fresnes) offered its employees to sell the land at a nominal price. Nearly 150 houses were built between 1953 and 1957. Their owners were fully invested in these constructions, working on weekends and after their workday. The rules were very strict: rest was only allowed one Sunday per month and only during a week of paid leave. The allocation of houses to employees was made by lot, one each until every house was built. Many houses are still occupied by the original ''Castor''.\n\n[[File:Maisons vignerons.jpg|thumb|Ancient wine growers' houses in the city centre]]\n\nThe housing seen in Antony today represents a diversified heritage:<ref name=\"PLU10089\" /> ancient houses in quarry stone, individual [[Art Nouveau]] house, [[Art Deco]] houses, and contemporary architecture.

The history of the commune merges with that of the Royal Domain formed in the 10th century by the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings which gave rise to the [[\u00cele-de-France]] region.\n\n===Prehistoric and Gallo-Roman era===\nIn prehistoric times people settled along the edges of the plateau<ref name=\"desorigines\"/> overlooking the valley. The remains of their settlements are still visible in the ''Bois de [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson|Verri\u00e8res]]''. The selection of sites was from the beginning conditioned by water and access. The village which later gave birth to Antony was installed in a location conducive to human settlement: a hillside site with many advantages - easy to protect because of its height with richer soil than that on the plateau and in an area not subject to flooding as it was above the marshes but at the level of water sources that rise from the green marl. The many fountains in Rue de l'Eglise and  the Avenue du Bois-de-Verri\u00e8res and the place names (Sources, Gouttieres (Gutters)...) testify to the existence of this [[Water table]].\n\nIn 1852,<ref name=\"cinqsi\u00e8cles\" /> when the cemetery was being moved from in front of the church, sarcophagi were discovered which were originally supposed to be [[Franks|Frankish]] or [[Merovingian]]. This allows the supposition that there was a constant presence of people around the Gallo-Roman villa.\n\n===Antony from the 10th to the 15th centuries===\n[[File:Ruelle \u00e0 Riou.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wells from the Middle Ages in the city centre, rebuilt in 1707 and transformed into a fountain in 1835.]]\n\nFrom the 10th to the 15th century the [[Lordship]] of Antony was one of the main dependencies of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]]. The location at Antony had a ford called ''Pont-aux-\u00c2nes'' (Bridge of the Asses) from Roman and medieval times. This hillside location provided Antony with a connection with [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], a stronghold which monitored the southern approaches to Paris. Antony also had a small fortress, the ''Tour d'Argent'' (Tower of Silver) which was located in the upper part of the village in a position overlooking the ford and possibly serving a defensive function.\n\nIn 1042, the King of France, [[Henry I of France|Henri I]], accorded the abbot of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s \"an altar dedicated to Saint Saturnin and located in the territory of Paris, in the jurisdiction called Paris\".\n\n[[File:Roue du moulin.jpg|thumb|left|The mill wheel ensured the production of [[flour]] for Antonians for 10 centuries.]]\n\nIn 1177 in recognition of the importance of the village Antony chapel became a parish church. The people were then all [[serf]]s of the Abbey. City dwellers then began to get communal [[Charter]]s and those campaigns began the great liberation movement that led to the emancipation of the serfs.\n\nThe decisive date was in 1248: Thomas de Mauleon, the Abbot of [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s|Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s]], freed his serfs in Antony and [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson|Verri\u00e8res]].<ref name=\"cinqsi\u00e8cles\" /> Many expenses still faced these farmers: they had to pay an annual rent, [[tithe]]s for the mills, ovens, and presses, and also provide [[Corv\u00e9e]]s or unpaid labour, such as cleaning the [[Bi\u00e8vre (river)|Bi\u00e8vre]] every three years.\n\nThe [[Kings of France]] had the right of accommodation in Antony. Under [[Louis IX]] there were lawsuits against people who refused to submit to this law. They were condemned.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries Antony had troubles from the [[Hundred Years War]] then the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War]]: plagues, famine and devastation. At the end of this long period, the Abbey was crushed by debt and the region was emptied of its inhabitants. There were only 100 inhabitants left in Antony at the end of the wars.\n\nIn 1346 King [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], on his way to the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], camped in Antony believing that [[Edward III]], King of England, would pass through there on his way to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The prince waited in vain for two days, the King of England having passed through [[Poissy]] heading towards [[Beauvais]].\n\n===The opening up (16th to 18th centuries)===\n[[File:Antony - Pigeonnier.JPG|thumb|The dovecote from Antony Castle (1648)]]\n\nThe road from [[Paris]] to [[Orl\u00e9ans]] was paved under [[Fran\u00e7ois I]]: it crossed the Bi\u00e8vre at the ''Pont d'Antony'' from which a path led to the centre of the village near the church of Saint-Saturnin.

The ''Sisters of the Cross of Saint-Andr\u00e9'' who had a girls' religious school at Antony since 1720, in 1928 became the ''Institute of the Cross'', then ''The Cross'' before being integrated into the ''Institution of Sainte-Marie of Antony'' which incorporated several religious congregations. The [[Marianists]] bought the Ch\u00e9nier property and installed their French seminar. Returning after their expulsion in 1903, their building became the Maison Saint-Jean, now a retreat for Marianists.

Elected mayor in 1912, he immediately attacked the problem of housing. Nicknamed in the newspaper \"Le P\u00e8re des mal-lotis\" (The Father of the poor), he created more than forty associations of the poor to carry out sanitation of housing. He built schools, many roads, and installed street lighting.\n\nIn 1940 refugees flocking to the capital to go south. The mayor organised dormitories in schools and sought to supply the refugees by any means and 7,000 Antonians remained on site out of 19,000 inhabitants. Schools were emptied: students and teachers were first sent to [[Savigny-sur-Braye]], then [[Saumur]], and finally [[Bouille-Loretz]]. On 14 June 1940 the Germans come into town and used the stadium and the Jules Ferry school as places to hold 8,000 prisoners of war.<ref>Collective work, ''Antony, from its origins to modern times'', \u00e9d.

The first director was ''Jacques Sarthou'', then the director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u00cele-de-France''. Often referred to as the spiritual son of ''Firmin G\u00e9mier'', given his similar experience in a traveling theatre, he hoped that this new theatre would take his name.<ref>[http://www.theatreonline.com/guide/detail_theatre.asp?i_Region=12&i_Theatre=25 The Firmin-G\u00e9mier theatre], TheatreOnline society website, consulted on 30 November 2008 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Several very creative directors were then appointed to the theatre: ''Jean Rougerie'' appointed in 1972, ''Pierrette Garreau'' and ''Marc Ansel'' in 1979, ''G\u00e9rard Savoisien'' in 1984, ''Ren\u00e9 Ch\u00e9neaux'' in 1991, ''Fran\u00e7ois Kergourlay'' in 1995, and ''Marc Jeancourt'' in 2000. All these directors brought to Antony a cultural life that has quickly found a loyal following. In 2003 a \"circus space\", national stage, was created where the Big Tops of \"new circuses\" performed regularly. A ''Sc\u00e8ne conventionn\u00e9e'',<ref>[http://www.theatrefirmingemier-lapiscine.fr/ Firmin-G\u00e9mier theatre], consulted on 30 November 2008 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> as part of the Agglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bi\u00e8vre, the Firmin G\u00e9mier theatre was associated in 2007 with the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre La Piscine'' of [[Chatenay-Malabry]]. The Spartan character and the inconvenient nature of infrastructure contrasted with the wealth of programming. In September 2011, following the discovery of asbestos in the premises, the theatre closed quickly and permanently. The construction of a new hall is planned near the municipal library.\n\nLocated in the Bourdeau Park, the \"Maison des Arts\" has free entrance and is dedicated to exhibitions with artistic programming, introductory workshops, and awareness for children.\n\n===Suburban Quarters===\nMuch of Antony consists of suburban districts. These homes were mostly built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shortly after the arrival of the Arpajonnais railway that transformed a self-sufficient agricultural village into a small market garden town then a residential town. Among these new houses, the houses on the Avenue Gabriel Peri were especially typical of the [[Art Nouveau]] style dating from 1890 to 1895. The subdivision of \"New Antony\" was designed by the architect [[Anatole de Baudot]] (who had already designed the [[Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]]).<ref>Heritage: Antony housing.

After the [[Second World War]], before the housing shortage, the French decided to build their own houses by joining in anonymous cooperative societies. Thus companies were created - e.g. \"The Cricket of \u00cele-de-France\" and \"The Castors of Bi\u00e8vre\". In 1953, the ''Company of Counters'' of [[Montrouge]] which had [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]]s at Antony (located behind the square Marc Sangnier on the border with Fresnes) offered its employees to sell the land at a nominal price. Nearly 150 houses were built between 1953 and 1957. Their owners were fully invested in these constructions, working on weekends and after their workday. The rules were very strict: rest was only allowed one Sunday per month and only during a week of paid leave. The allocation of houses to employees was made by lot, one each until every house was built. Many houses are still occupied by the original ''Castor''.\n\n[[File:Maisons vignerons.jpg|thumb|Ancient wine growers' houses in the city centre]]\n\nThe housing seen in Antony today represents a diversified heritage:<ref name=\"PLU10089\" /> ancient houses in quarry stone, individual [[Art Nouveau]] house, [[Art Deco]] houses, and contemporary architecture.

The history of the commune merges with that of the Royal Domain formed in the 10th century by the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings which gave rise to the [[\u00cele-de-France]] region.\n\n===Prehistoric and Gallo-Roman era===\nIn prehistoric times people settled along the edges of the plateau<ref name=\"desorigines\"/> overlooking the valley. The remains of their settlements are still visible in the ''Bois de [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson|Verri\u00e8res]]''. The selection of sites was from the beginning conditioned by water and access. The village which later gave birth to Antony was installed in a location conducive to human settlement: a hillside site with many advantages - easy to protect because of its height with richer soil than that on the plateau and in an area not subject to flooding as it was above the marshes but at the level of water sources that rise from the green marl. The many fountains in Rue de l'Eglise and  the Avenue du Bois-de-Verri\u00e8res and the place names (Sources, Gouttieres (Gutters)...) testify to the existence of this [[Water table]].\n\nIn 1852,<ref name=\"cinqsi\u00e8cles\" /> when the cemetery was being moved from in front of the church, sarcophagi were discovered which were originally supposed to be [[Franks|Frankish]] or [[Merovingian]]. This allows the supposition that there was a constant presence of people around the Gallo-Roman villa.\n\n===Antony from the 10th to the 15th centuries===\n[[File:Ruelle \u00e0 Riou.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wells from the Middle Ages in the city centre, rebuilt in 1707 and transformed into a fountain in 1835.]]\n\nFrom the 10th to the 15th century the [[Lordship]] of Antony was one of the main dependencies of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]]. The location at Antony had a ford called ''Pont-aux-\u00c2nes'' (Bridge of the Asses) from Roman and medieval times. This hillside location provided Antony with a connection with [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], a stronghold which monitored the southern approaches to Paris. Antony also had a small fortress, the ''Tour d'Argent'' (Tower of Silver) which was located in the upper part of the village in a position overlooking the ford and possibly serving a defensive function.\n\nIn 1042, the King of France, [[Henry I of France|Henri I]], accorded the abbot of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s \"an altar dedicated to Saint Saturnin and located in the territory of Paris, in the jurisdiction called Paris\".\n\n[[File:Roue du moulin.jpg|thumb|left|The mill wheel ensured the production of [[flour]] for Antonians for 10 centuries.]]\n\nIn 1177 in recognition of the importance of the village Antony chapel became a parish church. The people were then all [[serf]]s of the Abbey. City dwellers then began to get communal [[Charter]]s and those campaigns began the great liberation movement that led to the emancipation of the serfs.\n\nThe decisive date was in 1248: Thomas de Mauleon, the Abbot of [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s|Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s]], freed his serfs in Antony and [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson|Verri\u00e8res]].<ref name=\"cinqsi\u00e8cles\" /> Many expenses still faced these farmers: they had to pay an annual rent, [[tithe]]s for the mills, ovens, and presses, and also provide [[Corv\u00e9e]]s or unpaid labour, such as cleaning the [[Bi\u00e8vre (river)|Bi\u00e8vre]] every three years.\n\nThe [[Kings of France]] had the right of accommodation in Antony. Under [[Louis IX]] there were lawsuits against people who refused to submit to this law. They were condemned.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries Antony had troubles from the [[Hundred Years War]] then the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War]]: plagues, famine and devastation. At the end of this long period, the Abbey was crushed by debt and the region was emptied of its inhabitants. There were only 100 inhabitants left in Antony at the end of the wars.\n\nIn 1346 King [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], on his way to the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], camped in Antony believing that [[Edward III]], King of England, would pass through there on his way to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The prince waited in vain for two days, the King of England having passed through [[Poissy]] heading towards [[Beauvais]].\n\n===The opening up (16th to 18th centuries)===\n[[File:Antony - Pigeonnier.JPG|thumb|The dovecote from Antony Castle (1648)]]\n\nThe road from [[Paris]] to [[Orl\u00e9ans]] was paved under [[Fran\u00e7ois I]]: it crossed the Bi\u00e8vre at the ''Pont d'Antony'' from which a path led to the centre of the village near the church of Saint-Saturnin.

The [[Marianists]] bought the Ch\u00e9nier property and installed their French seminar. Returning after their expulsion in 1903, their building became the Maison Saint-Jean, now a retreat for Marianists.

Elected mayor in 1912, he immediately attacked the problem of housing. Nicknamed in the newspaper \"Le P\u00e8re des mal-lotis\" (The Father of the poor), he created more than forty associations of the poor to carry out sanitation of housing. He built schools, many roads, and installed street lighting.\n\nIn 1940 refugees flocking to the capital to go south.

The first director was ''Jacques Sarthou'', then the director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u00cele-de-France''.

All these directors brought to Antony a cultural life that has quickly found a loyal following. In 2003 a \"circus space\", national stage, was created where the Big Tops of \"new circuses\" performed regularly.

The Spartan character and the inconvenient nature of infrastructure contrasted with the wealth of programming. In September 2011, following the discovery of asbestos in the premises, the theatre closed quickly and permanently. The construction of a new hall is planned near the municipal library.\n\nLocated in the Bourdeau Park, the \"Maison des Arts\" has free entrance and is dedicated to exhibitions with artistic programming, introductory workshops, and awareness for children.\n\n===Suburban Quarters===\nMuch of Antony consists of suburban districts. These homes were mostly built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shortly after the arrival of the Arpajonnais railway that transformed a self-sufficient agricultural village into a small market garden town then a residential town. Among these new houses, the houses on the Avenue Gabriel Peri were especially typical of the [[Art Nouveau]] style dating from 1890 to 1895. The subdivision of \"New Antony\" was designed by the architect [[Anatole de Baudot]] (who had already designed the [[Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]]).<ref>Heritage: Antony housing.

Mr. Lehman solicited the assistance of a State Senator, the Honorable Dick Monteith, as well as the Professional Soil Scientists Association of California (PSSAC). The concept to designate the San Joaquin Soil as the official soil of California began a number of years ago when Gordon Huntington, and several other PSSAC members suggested that designating an official State Soil would be a worthwhile goal of the association, which conducted research and prepared supporting documentation. Mr. Lehman and his students approached Senator Monteith with PSSAC's documentation, including appropriate maps and soil description.  The students had also done their own research on other states already having an official state soil.   Senator Monteith was impressed and agreed to assist with the class's project.\n\nSB 389's journey began on February 14, 1997.  It passed via amendment in the [[California State Senate]] on March 20, 1997 and the [[California State Assembly]] on July 21, 1997.  From there it went to the [[Governor of California|California Governor]]'s desk and was signed into California [[Statutory law|Government Code]] on August 20, 1997 by Governor [[Pete Wilson]].\n\n==History of recognition==\nThe history of recognition and the development of the San Joaquin [[soil]] dates from the turn of the 20th century.  Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], began in 1899.  The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 as one of the first four [[soil series]] recognized in California by the survey.<ref>Bibliography of Soil Series, by C.F. Shaw and M. Baldwin, 1938.</ref>  All were considered to have [[agricultural]] importance.  Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other [[soil series]] recognized at a later date.  Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state.  (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.)  Nearly one-half million acres (2,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of this soil have now been identified and [[soil mapping|mapped]] in many counties in California.  With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy.   Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development.  As the [[Soil science|science of soil]] has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive [[soil morphology|soil characteristics]], its reddish [[soil color]] and its strongly cemented [[subsoil]] hardpan that limits root and water penetration.  Aside from the [[soil texture|texture]] and [[soil structure|structure]] of the [[topsoil|surface soil]], the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the [[subsoil]] above the [[hardpan]].  The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet.   The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant [[clay]] increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil.  The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40&nbsp;inches.  With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as [[soil color|color]], [[soil texture]], structure, consistence, [[soil pH|pH]], [[soil organic matter|organic matter]] content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, [[USDA soil taxonomy]] now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs.  The San Joaquin soil was first recognized in the survey of the Fresno Area in 1900.<ref>Soil Survey Around Fresno Area, California, by T.H. Means and J.G. Holmes, 1900.</ref>\n\nAt that time it was mapped as San Joaquin sandy loam on the \"Red Formation\" and characterized as being underlain by a \"red sandstone hardpan.\"  The soil was described as having a hog wallow ([[mound]] and [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]]) [[topography|relief]].  The depth to hardpan ranged from 1 foot to 6 feet.  The [[cement (geology)|cementing agent]] for the hard pan was thought to be [[ferric]] [[hydrate]] <!-- possibly this is the same as [[Ferric hydroxide]] aka [[Hydrated iron oxide]] aka [[Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] (includes [[Red ochre)), [[Feroxyhyte]], [[Limonite]], [[goethite]], [[lepidocrocite]], [[jarosite]])? -- Paleorthid --> with some [[lime (mineral)|lime]] [[carbonates]] and probably [[silica]].  About 74,500 acres (301&nbsp;km\u00b2) were mapped. The San Joaquin soil was next mapped in the [[Modesto, California|Modesto]]-[[Turlock]] Area in 1909.<ref>Soil Survey of the Modesto-Turlock Area, California, by A.T. Sweet, J.F. Warner, and L.C. Holmes, 1909</ref> and was described as having a \"brick red\" surface layer that was underlain by a \"[[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] hardpan\" at depths of 15 to 60&nbsp;inches.  A red clay loam layer above the hardpan was recognized.  About 90,000 acres (360&nbsp;km\u00b2) were mapped.  In 1911, the San Joaquin soil was mapped in the [[Madera County, California|Madera]] Area.<ref>Soil Survey of the Madera Area, California, by A.T. Strahorn, H.L. Westover, L.C. Holmes, E.C. Eckman, J.W. Nelson, and C. Van Duyne, 1911</ref>  The concept of the soil did not change in this survey.  It was noted that the soil became [[Vadose zone|saturated]] during the [[rainy season]] and became boggy and impassable except for well traveled roads.   About 138,000 acres (558&nbsp;km\u00b2) were mapped.The San Joaquin soil was again mapped in the 1914 update of the Fresno Area.<ref>Soil Survey of the Fresno Area, California, by A.T. Strahorn, J.W. Nelson, L.C. Holmes, and E.C. Eckman, 1914. \n</ref>\n\nThe concept of the soil did not change significantly from that of the original survey in 1900, but sandy loam and clay loam types were recognized.  In addition, an increase in clay content of the subsoil above the hardpan was described in some places.   Where the hardpan was less than 30&nbsp;inches deep, it was noted that it was necessary to fracture the hardpan by blasting to grow fruit trees.  There were about 127,000 acres (514&nbsp;km\u00b2) mapped. In the 1915 Reconnaissance Soil Survey of the Sacramento Valley, California by L.C. Holmes, et al., heavier (finer) textures, either clay loams or clays, were described as normally intervening between the surface soil and the hardpan in the San Joaquin soil   San Joaquin soils mapped in the Reconnaissance Soil Surveys of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and [[Southern California]] in 1915 to 1919 were similarly described.  San Joaquin soil identified in Southern California at that time have subsequently been correlated with other similar, but pedologically different soils.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s nine new [[soil survey]]s remapped, in greater detail, much of the area covered earlier by the Reconnaissance Soil Surveys of the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys.  For the most part, but not entirely, these surveys confined their recognition of San Joaquin soils to those areas of reddish hardpan soils having a clayey subsoil resting on the hardpan.  For a period of time, a very similar soil was recognized as the Rocklin series which differed from the San Joaquin series only in having thick, consolidated sediments beneath its hardpan, opposed to looser sediments beneath the San Joaquin hardpan.  This was considered to be of practical importance in modifying these soils for deep rooted crops.<ref>Some California Soils and Their Relationships, by C.F. Shaw, 1937</ref>\n\nBy the late 1930s and early 1940s, this concept was dropped and the Rocklin soil redefined as a reddish hardpan soil having a distinct subsoil above its hardpan, but lacking a clay pan.  The character of the materials beneath the hardpans of either soil was no longer a differentiating feature since consistent determination in mapping was not feasible. The Soil Manual for the Eleventh Farm Credit District, USDA, dated September 1, 1941, described the following concept of the San Joaquin soil:  \"As mapped in the past (San Joaquin soil) probably included several series.  As presently defined (this soil) occupies old [[fluvial terrace|terraces]], [[alluvial fan|fans]], and [[valley]] plains of [[granitic]] origin, mainly on the east side of the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys.  [[Topography]] - sloping to undulating with 'hog wallow' microrelief.  Reddish brown topsoil over heavier (finer textured) subsoil containing an [[Ferricrete|iron-cemented hardpan]].  Redder in the surface and denser hardpan than associated Madera soil.  Used mostly for [[pasture]] and for dry-farmed [[grain]].  Some [[fruit]] and other [[crops]] grown with fair success where [[irrigated]].\"\n\nFurther description of a San Joaquin [[soil profile]] was given in the Soil Manual as follows:  \"The surface soil reported as a reddish brown, gritty sandy loam about 14&nbsp;inches thick.  The subsoil reported as a sticky and very plastic, brownish red sandy clay loam about 10&nbsp;inches thick resting abruptly on a red or brownish red, indurated hardpan.The oldest official description of the San Joaquin Valley series, filed with the Soil Conservation Service, was dated January 1941, and revised August 1952.  The concept was similar to that used by the Eleventh Farm Credit District except that the subsoil was described as a sandy clay with an abrupt upper and lower boundary.  This was the first official description that approached the modern concept of the San Joaquin series.   Subsequent field and laboratory studies have led to further revisions and to the present concept given in the 1996 series description.In 1983, the type location for the San Joaquin soil was relocated to a site north of [[Lodi, California]], in San Joaquin county.  At that time, a monolith (a preserved 5 foot profile section) of the San Joaquin soil was prepared for this site and sent to the Netherlands World Soil Museum in Wageningen, the Netherlands.  Previously, the San Joaquin soil had been selected by the Soil Conservation Service as one of California's Benchmark Soils.  \"Benchmark Soils\" is a nationwide listing of soil series considered representative of soils in Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) in the United States.Modern soil survey maps now show the distribution of San Joaquin Soil of California in [[Fresno County, California|Fresno]], [[Madera County, California|Madera]], [[Mariposa County, California|Mariposa]], [[Merced County, California|Merced]], [[Placer County, California|Placer]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]], [[Sutter County, California|Sutter]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]], and [[Yuba County, California|Yuba]] Counties.

King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. 18 original 87th Battalion (CGG) members participated in the 1936 Vimy Ridge pilgrimage. Approximately 22 members of The Canadian Grenadier Guards (and associates) attended the 100th Anniversary in 2017.\n\n'''87th Battalion Panel - Menin Gate Ypres.''' The memorial is a covered archway with a bridge over the moat that surrounds the city. Inside, and on the stairwells on either side, there are panels for the names of the 56,000 soldiers, approximately 6,983 Canadians, without known graves.

The plane does not have to be parallel to the axis of the cone; the hyperbola will be symmetrical in any case.|alt=The image shows a double cone in which a geometrical plane has sliced off parts of the top and bottom half; the boundary curve of the slice on the cone is the hyperbola. A double cone consists of two cones stacked point-to-point and sharing the same axis of rotation; it may be generated by rotating a line about an axis that passes through a point of the line.]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-ass-e.svg|300px|thumb|Hyperbola (red): features]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''hyperbola''' (plural ''hyperbolas'' or ''hyperbolae'') is a type of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[plane curve|curve lying on a plane]], defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite [[bow (weapon)|bows]].  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of [[conic section]], formed by the intersection of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  (The other conic sections are the [[parabola]] and the [[ellipse]]. A [[circle]] is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a [[sundial]],\n* as the shape of an [[open orbit]] (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a [[spacecraft]] during a [[gravity assist]]ed swing-by of a planet or, more generally, any spacecraft exceeding the [[escape velocity]] of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition [[comet]] (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the [[Rutherford scattering|scattering trajectory]] of a [[subatomic particle]] (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in [[hyperbolic navigation|radio navigation]], when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the [[asymptote]] of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of [[symmetry]] of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> the asymptotes are the two [[coordinate axes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[focus (geometry)|focus]], and [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other [[mathematical object]]s have their origin in the hyperbola, such as [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s (saddle surfaces), [[hyperboloid]]s (\"wastebaskets\"), [[hyperbolic geometry]] ([[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s celebrated [[non-Euclidean geometry]]), [[hyperbolic function]]s (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and [[gyrovector space]]s (a geometry proposed for use in both [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] which is not [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]]).\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}, meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term [[hyperbole]] also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by [[Menaechmus]] in his investigations of the problem of [[doubling the cube]], but were then called sections of obtuse cones.<ref>{{citation |title=Apollonius of Perga: Treatise on Conic Sections with Introductions Including an Essay on Earlier History on the Subject |first=Sir Thomas Little |last=Heath |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1896 |contribution=Chapter I.

The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.<ref>{{citation|pages=30\u201331|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=A Survey of Geometry (Vol. One)|year=1963|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of a hyperbola as locus of points ==\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-e.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition by the distances of points to two fixed points (foci)]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-dc.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition with circular directrix]]\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points ([[locus of points]]) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n:A '''hyperbola''' is a set of points, such that for any point <math>P</math> of the set, the absolute difference of the distances <math>|PF_1|,\\ |PF_2|</math> to two fixed points <math>F_1,F_2</math> (the ''foci''), is  constant, usually denoted by <math>2a, \\ a>0\\ :</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=308\u2013310}}</ref>\n\n:<math>H = \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a \\}\\ .</math>\n\nThe midpoint <math>M</math> of the line segment joining the foci is called the ''center'' of the hyperbola.<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|p=310}}</ref> The line through the foci is called the ''major axis''.

The process of \"reciprocation in a circle ''C''\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding [[pole and polar]], respectively. The ''pole'' of a line is the [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]] of its closest point to the circle ''C'', whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to ''C'' is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius ''r'' of reciprocation circle ''C''. If '''B''' and '''C''' represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n</math>\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center '''B''' must lie outside of the reciprocating circle ''C''.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle ''B'', as well as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the polar lines of the points on ''B''. Conversely, the circle ''B'' is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to ''B'' have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center '''C''' of the reciprocation circle ''C''; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on ''B'' are the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.<br />\n(If center ''O'' were ''on'' the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see [[stereographic projection]]).]]\nBesides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a [[central projection]] onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point ''O'', the center. The '''lens plane''' is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens ''O''.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \n:a) a '''circle''', if circle ''c'' is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\n:b) an '''ellipse''', if ''c'' has ''no'' point with the lens plane in common,\n:c) a '''parabola''', if ''c'' has ''one'' point with the lens plane in common and\n:d) a '''hyperbola''', if ''c'' has ''two'' points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point ''O'' are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point ''O'' generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\n==Arc length==\nThe arc length of a hyperbola does not have a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form expression]]. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as\n\n:<math>y=b\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-1}.</math>\n\nThen the integral giving the arc length <math>s</math> from <math>x_{1}</math> to <math>x_{2}</math> can be computed [[Numerical integration|numerically]]:\n\n:<math>s=b\\int_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}} \\sqrt{1+\\left(1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\sinh ^{2}v} \\, \\mathrm dv.</math>\n\nAfter using the substitution <math>z=iv</math>, this can also be represented using the [[Elliptic integral|elliptic integral]] of the second kind with parameter <math>m=k^{2}</math>:\n\n:<math>s=-ib\\Biggr[E\\left(iz \\, \\Biggr| \\, 1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\\Biggr]^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}}_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}.</math>\n\n==Derived curves==\n{{Sinusoidal_spirals.svg}}\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]], the so-called [[inverse curve]]s of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a [[lima\u00e7on]] or a [[strophoid]], respectively.\n\n== Elliptic coordinates ==\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of [[elliptic coordinates]] in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n</math>\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance ''c'' from the origin on the ''x''-axis, and where \u03b8 is the angle of the asymptotes with the ''x''-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a [[conformal map]] of the Cartesian coordinate system ''w'' = ''z'' + 1/''z'', where ''z''= ''x'' + ''iy'' are the original Cartesian coordinates, and ''w''=''u'' + ''iv'' are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping ''w'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\n==Other properties of hyperbolas==\n*The following are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]]: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.<ref name=web4>{{cite web|url=http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html|title=Hyperbola|website=Mathafou.free.fr|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"web1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202180210/http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP's.htm |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.<ref name=web1/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie Pawilon C.JPG|thumb|right|Hyperbolas as declination lines on a sundial]]\n\n===Sundials===\nHyperbolas may be seen in many [[sundial]]s. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the [[celestial sphere]], and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the ''declination line''). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a ''pelekinon'' by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\n===Multilateration===\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving [[multilateration]] problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points \u2014 or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a [[LORAN]] or [[GPS]] transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2''a'' from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2''a'' whose foci are the two given points.\n\n===Path followed by a particle===\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical [[Kepler problem]] is a [[conic section]]. In particular, if the total energy ''E'' of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford experiment]] demonstrated the existence of an [[atomic nucleus]] by examining the scattering of [[alpha particle]]s from [[gold]] atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], which satisfies the [[inverse square law]] requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\n===Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation===\nThe hyperbolic trig function <math>\\operatorname{sech}\\, x</math> appears as one solution to the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\n===Angle trisection===\n[[File:Hyperbola angle trisection.svg|thumb|Trisecting an angle (AOB) using a hyperbola of eccentricity 2 (yellow curve)]]\n\nAs shown first by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a hyperbola can be used to [[angle trisection|trisect any angle]], a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex '''O''', which intersects the sides of the angle at points '''A''' and '''B'''. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  '''A''' and '''B''' and its perpendicular bisector <math>\\ell</math>. Construct a hyperbola of [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''e''=2 with <math>\\ell</math> as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and '''B''' as a focus. Let '''P''' be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle '''POB''' trisects angle '''AOB'''.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment '''OP''' about the line <math>\\ell</math> obtaining the point '''P'''' as the image of '''P'''. Segment '''AP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the reflection, while segment '''PP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As '''OA''', '''OP'''', '''OP''' and '''OB''' are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles '''OAP'''', '''OPP'''' and '''OPB''' are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3\u00d7'''POB''' = '''AOB'''.<ref>This construction is due to [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (circa 300 A.D.) and the proof comes from {{harvtxt|Kazarinoff|1970|loc=pg. 62}}.</ref>\n\n===Efficient portfolio frontier===\nIn [[modern portfolio theory#The efficient frontier with no risk-free asset|portfolio theory]], the locus of [[mean variance efficiency|mean-variance efficient]] portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.\n\n===Biochemistry===\nIn [[biochemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equation]] and [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill-Langmuir equation]] respectively describe biological [[Stimulus\u2013response model|responses]] and the formation of [[protein\u2013ligand complex]]es as functions of ligand concentration.

A hyperbola has two pieces, called [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite [[bow (weapon)|bows]].  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of [[conic section]], formed by the intersection of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  (The other conic sections are the [[parabola]] and the [[ellipse]]. A [[circle]] is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a [[sundial]],\n* as the shape of an [[open orbit]] (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a [[spacecraft]] during a [[gravity assist]]ed swing-by of a planet or, more generally, any spacecraft exceeding the [[escape velocity]] of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition [[comet]] (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the [[Rutherford scattering|scattering trajectory]] of a [[subatomic particle]] (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in [[hyperbolic navigation|radio navigation]], when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the [[asymptote]] of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of [[symmetry]] of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> the asymptotes are the two [[coordinate axes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[focus (geometry)|focus]], and [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other [[mathematical object]]s have their origin in the hyperbola, such as [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s (saddle surfaces), [[hyperboloid]]s (\"wastebaskets\"), [[hyperbolic geometry]] ([[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s celebrated [[non-Euclidean geometry]]), [[hyperbolic function]]s (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and [[gyrovector space]]s (a geometry proposed for use in both [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] which is not [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]]).\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}, meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term [[hyperbole]] also derives.

The ''pole'' of a line is the [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]] of its closest point to the circle ''C'', whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to ''C'' is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius ''r'' of reciprocation circle ''C''.

Two tangent lines to ''B'' have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center '''C''' of the reciprocation circle ''C''; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on ''B'' are the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.<br />\n(If center ''O'' were ''on'' the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see [[stereographic projection]]).]]\nBesides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a [[central projection]] onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point ''O'', the center. The '''lens plane''' is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens ''O''.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \n:a) a '''circle''', if circle ''c'' is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\n:b) an '''ellipse''', if ''c'' has ''no'' point with the lens plane in common,\n:c) a '''parabola''', if ''c'' has ''one'' point with the lens plane in common and\n:d) a '''hyperbola''', if ''c'' has ''two'' points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point ''O'' are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point ''O'' generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\n==Arc length==\nThe arc length of a hyperbola does not have a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form expression]]. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as\n\n:<math>y=b\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-1}.</math>\n\nThen the integral giving the arc length <math>s</math> from <math>x_{1}</math> to <math>x_{2}</math> can be computed [[Numerical integration|numerically]]:\n\n:<math>s=b\\int_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}} \\sqrt{1+\\left(1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\sinh ^{2}v} \\, \\mathrm dv.</math>\n\nAfter using the substitution <math>z=iv</math>, this can also be represented using the [[Elliptic integral|elliptic integral]] of the second kind with parameter <math>m=k^{2}</math>:\n\n:<math>s=-ib\\Biggr[E\\left(iz \\, \\Biggr| \\, 1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\\Biggr]^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}}_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}.</math>\n\n==Derived curves==\n{{Sinusoidal_spirals.svg}}\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]], the so-called [[inverse curve]]s of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a [[lima\u00e7on]] or a [[strophoid]], respectively.\n\n== Elliptic coordinates ==\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of [[elliptic coordinates]] in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n</math>\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance ''c'' from the origin on the ''x''-axis, and where \u03b8 is the angle of the asymptotes with the ''x''-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a [[conformal map]] of the Cartesian coordinate system ''w'' = ''z'' + 1/''z'', where ''z''= ''x'' + ''iy'' are the original Cartesian coordinates, and ''w''=''u'' + ''iv'' are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping ''w'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\n==Other properties of hyperbolas==\n*The following are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]]: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.<ref name=web4>{{cite web|url=http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html|title=Hyperbola|website=Mathafou.free.fr|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"web1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202180210/http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP's.htm |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.<ref name=web1/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie Pawilon C.JPG|thumb|right|Hyperbolas as declination lines on a sundial]]\n\n===Sundials===\nHyperbolas may be seen in many [[sundial]]s. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the [[celestial sphere]], and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the ''declination line''). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a ''pelekinon'' by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\n===Multilateration===\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving [[multilateration]] problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points \u2014 or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a [[LORAN]] or [[GPS]] transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2''a'' from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2''a'' whose foci are the two given points.\n\n===Path followed by a particle===\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical [[Kepler problem]] is a [[conic section]]. In particular, if the total energy ''E'' of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford experiment]] demonstrated the existence of an [[atomic nucleus]] by examining the scattering of [[alpha particle]]s from [[gold]] atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], which satisfies the [[inverse square law]] requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\n===Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation===\nThe hyperbolic trig function <math>\\operatorname{sech}\\, x</math> appears as one solution to the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\n===Angle trisection===\n[[File:Hyperbola angle trisection.svg|thumb|Trisecting an angle (AOB) using a hyperbola of eccentricity 2 (yellow curve)]]\n\nAs shown first by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a hyperbola can be used to [[angle trisection|trisect any angle]], a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex '''O''', which intersects the sides of the angle at points '''A''' and '''B'''. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  '''A''' and '''B''' and its perpendicular bisector <math>\\ell</math>. Construct a hyperbola of [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''e''=2 with <math>\\ell</math> as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and '''B''' as a focus. Let '''P''' be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle '''POB''' trisects angle '''AOB'''.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment '''OP''' about the line <math>\\ell</math> obtaining the point '''P'''' as the image of '''P'''. Segment '''AP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the reflection, while segment '''PP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As '''OA''', '''OP'''', '''OP''' and '''OB''' are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles '''OAP'''', '''OPP'''' and '''OPB''' are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3\u00d7'''POB''' = '''AOB'''.<ref>This construction is due to [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (circa 300 A.D.) and the proof comes from {{harvtxt|Kazarinoff|1970|loc=pg. 62}}.</ref>\n\n===Efficient portfolio frontier===\nIn [[modern portfolio theory#The efficient frontier with no risk-free asset|portfolio theory]], the locus of [[mean variance efficiency|mean-variance efficient]] portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.\n\n===Biochemistry===\nIn [[biochemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equation]] and [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill-Langmuir equation]] respectively describe biological [[Stimulus\u2013response model|responses]] and the formation of [[protein\u2013ligand complex]]es as functions of ligand concentration.

The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the [[spice trade]], the [[Silk Road]], and the [[Royal Road]]. It eventually rivaled [[Alexandria]] as the chief city of the Near East. The city was the capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]] until 63 B.C. when the Romans took control, making it the seat of the governor of the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]]. From the early 4th century, the city was the seat of the Count of the Orient, head of the regional administration of sixteen provinces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was also the main center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] at the end of the [[Second Temple period]]. Antioch was one of the most important cities in the [[eastern Mediterranean]] of Rome's dominions.

The city was a [[metropolis]] of a quarter million people during [[Augustus|Augustan]] times,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} but it declined to relative insignificance during the [[Middle Ages]] because of warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in [[trade route]]s, which no longer passed through Antioch from the far east following the [[Mongol invasions and conquests]].\n\n==Geography==\nTwo routes from the [[Mediterranean]], lying through the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] gorge and the [[Beilan Pass]], converge in the plain of the [[Lake Amik|Antioch Lake]] (''Bal\u00fck Geut'' or ''El Bahr'') and are met there by\n#the road from the [[Amanian Gate]] (Baghche Pass) and western [[Commagene]], which descends the valley of the [[Karasu (Hatay)|Karasu River]] to the [[Afrin River]],\n#the roads from eastern Commagene and the Euphratean crossings at [[Samosata]] (Samsat) and [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea Zeugma]] (Birejik), which descend the valleys of the [[Afrin River|Afrin]] and the [[Quweiq]] rivers, and\n#the road from the Euphratean ford at [[Thapsacus]], which skirts the fringe of the Syrian steppe. A single route proceeds south in the Orontes valley.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe settlement called Meroe pre-dated Antioch. A shrine of the Semitic goddess [[Anat]], called by Herodotus the \"[[Achaemenid empire|Persian]] [[Artemis]]\", was located here. This site was included in the eastern suburbs of Antioch. There was a village on the spur of Mount Silpius named ''Io'', or ''[[Iopolis]]''. This name was always adduced as evidence by Antiochenes (''e.g.'' [[Libanius]]) anxious to affiliate themselves to the Attic [[Ionians]]\u2014an eagerness which is illustrated by the Athenian types used on the city's coins. Io may have been a small early colony of trading Greeks ([[Javan]]). [[John Malalas]] also mentions an archaic village, [[Bottia]], in the plain by the river.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\n===Foundation by Seleucus I===\n[[Alexander the Great]] is said to have camped on the site of Antioch, and dedicated an altar to [[Zeus]] Bottiaeus; it lay in the northwest of the future city.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}} This account is found<ref>{{cite book|title=Antioch as a Centre of Hellenic Culture as Observed by Libanius|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fscXhWwDbusC&pg=PA23 |year=2000|place=Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool University Press|others=Translated with an introduction by A.F.

Libanius describes the first building and arrangement of this city (i. p.&nbsp;300. 17). The citadel was on Mt. Silpius and the city lay mainly on the low ground to the north, fringing the river. Two great colonnaded streets intersected in the centre. Shortly afterwards a second quarter was laid out, probably on the east and by [[Antiochus I]], which, from an expression of [[Strabo]], appears to have been the native, as contrasted with the Greek, town. It was enclosed by a wall of its own.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\nIn the Orontes, north of the city, lay a large island, and on this [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] began a third walled \"city\", which was finished by [[Antiochus III]]. A fourth and last quarter was added by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (175\u2013164&nbsp;BC); thenceforth Antioch was known as ''Tetrapolis''. From west to east the whole was about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} in diameter and a little less from north to south. This area included many large gardens.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\nThe new city was populated by a mix of local settlers that Athenians brought from the nearby city of Antigonia, Macedonians, and Jews (who were given full status from the beginning). The total free population of Antioch at its foundation has been estimated at between 17,000 and 25,000, not including slaves and native settlers.<ref name=\"ebd\"/> During the late Hellenistic period and Early Roman period, Antioch's population reached its peak of over 500,000 inhabitants (estimates generally are 200,000 250,000) and was the third largest city in the Empire after Rome and Alexandria. In the second half of the 4th century Libanius gives the figure 150,000 and John Chrysostom, 200,000 (without children and slaves counted)<ref>A.H.M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, Vol. II 1984 pp. 1040 and 1409 {{ISBN|0-8018-3354-X}}</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} west and beyond the suburb Heraclea lay the paradise of Daphne, a park of woods and waters, in the midst of which rose a great temple to the Pythian Apollo, also founded by Seleucus I and enriched with a cult-statue of the god, as Musagetes, by [[Bryaxis]]. A companion sanctuary of Hecate was constructed underground by [[Diocletian]]. The beauty and the lax morals of Daphne were celebrated all over the western world; and indeed Antioch as a whole shared in both these titles to fame.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|pp=130-131}}\n\nAntioch became the capital and court-city of the western Seleucid empire under [[Antiochus I]], its counterpart in the east being [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]; but its paramount importance dates from the battle of Ancyra (240&nbsp;BC), which shifted the Seleucid centre of gravity from Asia Minor, and led indirectly to the rise of [[Pergamum]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\nThe Seleucids reigned from Antioch. We know little of it in the [[Hellenistic period]], apart from [[Syria]], all our information coming from authors of the late Roman time. Among its great Greek buildings we hear only of the theatre, of which substructures still remain on the flank of Silpius, and of the royal palace, probably situated on the island. It enjoyed a reputation for being \"a populous city, full of most erudite men and rich in the most liberal studies\",<ref>[[Cicero]] ''[[Pro Archia]]'', 4</ref> but the only names of distinction in these pursuits during the Seleucid period that have come down to us are Apollophanes, the Stoic, and one Phoebus, a writer on dreams. The nicknames which they gave to their later kings were Aramaic; and, except [[Apollo]] and [[Daphne]], the great divinities of north Syria seem to have remained essentially native, such as the \"Persian Artemis\" of Meroe and [[Atargatis]] of [[Hierapolis Bambyce]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\nThe epithet \"Golden\" suggests that the external appearance of Antioch was impressive, but the city needed constant restoration owing to the [[earthquake|seismic disturbances]] to which the district has always been subjected. The first great earthquake in recorded history was related by the native chronicler [[John Malalas]]. It occurred in 148&nbsp;BC and did immense damage.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}<ref>[[John Malalas]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#207 Book 8, pp.207\u2013208]</ref>\n\nLocal politics were turbulent. In the many dissensions of the Seleucid house the population took sides, and frequently rose in rebellion, for example against [[Alexander Balas]] in 147&nbsp;BC, and [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]] in 129&nbsp;BC. The latter, enlisting a body of Jews, punished his capital with fire and sword. In the last struggles of the Seleucid house, Antioch turned against its feeble rulers, invited [[Tigranes the great|Tigranes of Armenia]] to occupy the city in 83&nbsp;BC, tried to unseat [[Antiochus XIII]] in 65&nbsp;BC, and petitioned Rome against his restoration in the following year. Antioch's wish prevailed, and it passed with Syria to the [[Roman Republic]] in 64&nbsp;BC, but remained a ''civitas libera''.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\n===Roman period===\n[[File:Ancient Roman road of Tall Aqibrin.jpg|thumb|250px|Ancient [[Roman road]] located in [[Syria]] which connected Antioch and [[Chalcis, Syria|Chalcis]].]]\n[[File:Argenteus-Constantius I-antioch RIC 033a.jpg|thumb|250px|This [[argenteus]] was struck in the Antioch mint, under [[Constantius Chlorus]].]]\n[[File:Domitian Tetradrachm 1.jpg|alt=Domitian Tetradrachm from Antioch Mint|thumb|250x250px|Rare Domitian Tetradrachm struck in the Antioch Mint.

To a certain extent they tried to make it an eastern Rome. [[Julius Caesar]] visited it in 47&nbsp;BC, and confirmed its freedom. A great temple to Jupiter Capitolinus rose on Silpius, probably at the insistence of [[Augustus|Octavian]], whose cause the city had espoused. A [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of Roman type was laid out.

Antioch had a mixed pagan and Christian population, which [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] implies lived quite harmoniously together. However Julian's visit began ominously as it coincided with a lament for [[Adonis]], the doomed lover of [[Aphrodite]]. Thus, Ammianus wrote, the emperor and his soldiers entered the city not to the sound of cheers but to wailing and screaming.\n\nAfter being advised that the bones of 3rd-century martyred bishop [[Babylas of Antioch|Babylas]] were suppressing the oracle of Apollo at Daphne,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |title=St John Chrysostom's homily on Saint Babylas |access-date=2012-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706194336/http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.12.8{{snd}}22.13.3</ref><ref>[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 3.18</ref>\n\nJulian found much else about which to criticize the Antiochene;  Julian had wanted the empire's cities to be more self-managing, as they had been some [[Antonines|200&nbsp;years before]]. However Antioch's [[Decurion (administrative)|city councilmen]] showed themselves unwilling to shore up Antioch's food shortage with their own resources, so dependent were they on the emperor. Ammianus wrote that the councilmen shirked their duties by bribing unwitting men in the marketplace to do the job for them.\n\nThe city's impiety to the old religion was clear to Julian when he attended the city's annual feast of Apollo. To his surprise and dismay the only Antiochene present was an old priest clutching a goose.\n\nThe Antiochenes in turn hated Julian for worsening the food shortage with the burden of his [[billet]]ed troops, wrote [[Ammianus]]. The soldiers were often to be found gorged on sacrificial meat, making a drunken nuisance of themselves on the streets while Antioch's hungry citizens looked on in disgust. The Christian Antiochenes and Julian's pagan [[Gauls|Gallic]] soldiers also never quite saw eye to eye.\n\nEven Julian's piety was distasteful to the Antiochenes even to those who kept the old religion. Julian's brand of paganism was very much unique to himself, with little support outside the most educated [[Neo Platonism|Neoplatonist]] circles. The irony of Julian's enthusiasm for large scale [[animal sacrifice]] could not have escaped the hungry Antiochenes. Julian gained no admiration for his personal involvement in the sacrifices, only the nickname ''axeman'', wrote Ammianus.\n\nThe emperor's high-handed, severe methods and his rigid administration prompted Antiochene [[parody|lampoon]]s about, among other things, Julian's unfashionably [[goatee|pointed beard]].<ref>''Ridebatur enim ut Cercops...barbam prae se ferens hircinam.''

Raymond agreed with the emperor that if he was capable of capturing [[Aleppo]], [[Shaizar]], and [[Homs]], he would exchange Antioch for them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Annales Herbipolenses]]'', s.a. 1147: A Hostile View of the Crusade</ref>\n\nJohn went on to attack Aleppo with the aid of Antioch and Edessa, and failed to capture it, with the Franks withdrawing their support when he moved on to capture Shaizar. John returned to Antioch ahead of his army and entered Antioch, only to be forced to leave when [[Joscelin II, Count of Edessa]] rallied the citizens to oust him. In 1142 John then returned but Raymond refused to submit and John was forced to return to Cilicia again due to the coming winter, to plan an attack the following season. However the emperor died on April 8, 1143.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Second Crusade====\n\nThe following year after the death of [[John II Comnenus]], [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]] lay [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|siege to Edessa]], the crusader capital, and with the death of Imad ad-Din Zengi in 1146, he was succeeded by his son, Nur ad-Din Zangi. Zangi attacked Antioch in both 1147 and 1148 and succeeded during the second venture in occupying most of the territory east of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] including [[Artah]], [[Kafr Latah|Kafar Latha]], Basarfut, and Balat, but failing to capture Antioch itself. With the Second Crusades army previously nearly entirely defeated by the Turks and by sickness, [[Louis VII of France]] arrived in Antioch on March 19, 1148 after being delayed by storms. Louis was welcomed by the uncle of his spouse [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], Raymond of Poitiers.\n\nLouis refused to help Antioch defend against the Turks and to lead an expedition against Aleppo, and instead decided to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the Crusades. With Louis quickly leaving Antioch again and the Crusades returning home in 1149,<ref>The Crusades: A Documentary Survey Brundage</ref> Nur ad-Din launched an offensive against the territories which were dominated by the Castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the Orontes, after which Nur besieged the castle of Inag. [[Raymond of Poitiers]] quickly came to the aid of the citadel, where he was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Inab]], Raymond's head was then cut off and sent to Nur, who sent it to the caliph in [[Baghdad]]. However, Nur ad-Din did not attack Antioch itself and was content with capturing all of Antiochene territory that lay east of the Orontes.<ref>Studies in the History of Relations between Orient and Occident in the Middle Ages.

In 1152 [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] came of age, but from 1150 he had proposed three different but respectable suitors for Constance's hand in marriage, all of whom she rejected. In 1153 however, she chose [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] and married him in secret without consulting her first cousin and liege lord, Baldwin III, and neither Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges approved of her choice.<ref>Les Familles d'Outremer</ref>\n\nIn 1156 Raynald claimed that the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] had reneged on his promises to pay Raynald a sum of money, and vowed to attack the island of Cyprus in revenge. However Aimery refused to finance Raynald's expedition, so in turn Raynald had the Patriarch seized, beaten, stripped naked, covered in honey, and had him left in the burning sun on top of the citadel to be attacked by insects. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition.<ref>od's War: A New History of the Crusade</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Raynald had allied himself with the Armenian prince, [[Thoros II, Prince of Armenia|Thoros II]]. In 1156 Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island over a three-week period, with [[Wiktionary:rapine|rapine]], killing, and plundering its citizens. After which, [[Manuel I Comnenus]] raised an army and began their march towards Syria, as a result Raynald threw himself to the mercy of the emperor who insisted on the installation of a Greek Patriarch and the surrender of the citadel in Antioch. The following spring, Manuel made a triumphant entry into the city and established himself as the unquestioned [[suzerain]] of Antioch.\n\nIn 1160 Raynald was captured by Muslims during a plundering raid against the Syrian and Armenian peasants of the neighborhood of [[Marash]]. He was held captive for sixteen years, and as the stepfather of the Empress Maria, he was ransomed by Manuel for 120,000 [[gold dinar]]s in 1176 (about 500&nbsp;kg of gold, worth approximately \u00a316 million or US$26 million {{as of|2010|October|lc=y}}). With Raynald disposed of for a long time, the patriarch Aimery became the new regent, chosen by Baldwin III. To further consolidate his own claim over Antioch, Manuel chose [[Maria of Antioch]] as his bride, daughter of [[Constance of Antioch]] and [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. But the government of Antioch remained in crisis up until 1163, when Constance asked the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] to help maintain her rule, as a result the citizens of Antioch exiled her and installed her son [[Bohemond III]] and now brother-in-law to the emperor, as regent.<ref>Religious and Military Crusader Orders in Syria in the 12th and 13th Centuries. Amman 2003.</ref>\n\nOne year later, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] captured Bohemond III when he defeated a joint Antiochene-Tripolitan army. Bohemond III was soon released, however [[Harem, Syria]] which Raynald had recaptured in 1158, was lost again and the frontier of Antioch was permanently placed west of the Orontes. Byzantine influence remained in Antioch and in 1165, Bohemond III married a niece of the emperor, [[Maria of Antioch]], and installed a Greek patriarch in the city, [[Athanasius II, Patriarch of Antioch]], who remained in his position until he died in an earthquake five years later.<ref>Seeing Islam as Others Saw\nAthanasius II</ref><ref>Earthquakes in Syria during the Crusades. Cairo 1996.</ref>\n\n====Third Crusade====\nOn October 29, 1187, [[Pope Gregory VIII]] issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Audita tremendi]]'', his call for the Third Crusade.<ref>J. N. Kelly, The Oxford Dictionary of Popes, New York: Oxford UP, 1986, 183.</ref> [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], [[Richard I of England]], and [[Philip II of France]] answered the summons. With Richard and Philip deciding to take a sea route, Frederick lacked the necessary ships and took a land route where he pushed on through [[Anatolia]], defeating the Turks in the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)|Battle of Iconium]], however upon reaching Christian territory in [[Lesser Armenia]] ([[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]) the emperor drowned in the river [[Saleph]]. The emperor was buried at Antioch and the Germans became an insignificant contingent during the crusade. Throughout the Third Crusade Antioch remained neutral, however with the end of the Third Crusade (1192), they were included in the [[Treaty of Ramla]] between Richard and Saladin.<ref>Axelrod, Alan and Charles L.

However Bohemond installed his younger, the future prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], as count of Tripoli. Shortly after the end of the Third Crusade, Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli married [[Alice of Armenia]], the niece of Leo II, or [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], and a vassal to Antioch. Alice bore Raymond IV a son in 1199, [[Raymond-Roupen]], after which Raymond IV died in the coming months. In 1194 Leo II tricked Bohemond III making him believe that the new born prince had been captured by the Roupenians. Leo made a failed attempt at capturing Antioch believing the city would be weakened with the absence of Bohemond.\n\n[[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] nephew to both Richard I and Philip II, travelled to [[Lesser Armenia]] and managed to persuade Leo that in exchange for Antioch, renouncing its overlordship to Lesser Armenia and to release Bohemond, who in 1201 died. With the death of Bohemond III there followed a 15-year struggle for power of Antioch, between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia. According to the rules of [[primogeniture]] Leo's great nephew Raymond-Roupen was the rightful heir of Antioch, and Leo's position was supported by the pope. However, on the other hand, the city commune of Antioch supported [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], on the grounds that he was the closest blood relative to the last ruling prince, Bohemond III. In 1207 Bohemond IV installed a Greek patriarch in Antioch, despite the [[East-West Schism]], under the help of Aleppo, Bohemond IV drove Leo out of Antioch.<ref>A short history of Antioch, 300&nbsp;B.C.-A.D. 1268 (1921)</ref><ref>Riley-Smith, Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</ref>\n\n====Fifth Crusade and afterwards====\n{{See also|Armeno-Mongol relations}}\nIn 1213 [[Pope Innocent III]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'' called for all of Christendom to lead a new (Fifth) crusade. This strengthened the support of [[sultan]] [[al-Adil I]] (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644), an [[Ayyubid]]-Egyptian general who supported Raymond-Roupen's claims in Antioch. In 1216 Leo installed Raymond-Roupen as prince of Antioch, and ending all military aspect of the struggle between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia, but the citizens again revolted against Raymond-Roupen in c. 1219 and Bohemond of Tripoli was recognised as the fourth prince of that name. Bohemond IV and his son Bohemond V remained neutral in the struggles of the [[Ghibellines|Guelphs and Ghibellines]] to the south which arose when Frederich II married Isabella II, and in 1233 Bohemond IV died.\n\nFrom 1233 onwards Antioch declined and appeared rarely in records for 30&nbsp;years, and in 1254 the altercations of the past between Antioch and Armenia were laid to rest when [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]] married the then 17\u2011year\u2011old [[Sibylla of Armenia]], and Bohemond VI became a vassal of the Armenian kingdom. Effectively, the Armenian kings ruled Antioch while the prince of Antioch resided in Tripoli. The Armenians drew up a treaty with the Mongols, who were now ravaging Muslim lands, and under protection they extended their territory into the lands of the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the north and the Aleppo territory to the south. Antioch was part of this Armeno-Mongol alliance. Bohemond VI managed to retake Lattakieh and reestablished the land bridge between Antioch and Tripoli, while the Mongols insisted he install the Greek patriarch there rather than a Latin one, due to the Mongols attempting to strengthen ties with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This earned Bohemond the enmity of the Latins of Acre, and Bohemond was excommunicated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Pope Urban IV]],<ref>Runciman, pp. 306\u2013307. \"To the Latins at Acre Bohemond's subservience seemed disgraceful, especially as it involved the humiliation of the Latin Church at Antioch...Bohemond was excommunicated by the Pope for this alliance (Urban IV, Registres, 26 May 1263)</ref> which was later suspended.<ref>Jean Richard, The Crusades: c. 1071{{snd}}c. 1291, pp 423\u2013426</ref><ref>\"Ghazan resumed his plans against Egypt in 1297: the Franco-Mongol cooperation had thus survived, in spite of the loss of Acre by the Franks, and the conversion of the Persian Mongols to Islam.

The [[Mamluk]] [[sultan]] [[Saif ad-Din Qutuz]] looked to ally with the Franks, who declined. In September 1260, the Mamluks defeated the Mongols at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]], shortly after Qutuz was assassinated at [[Al-Salihiyya]], and according to various sources his successor [[Baibars]] was involved in his murder.<ref>Al-Maqrizi, p. 519/vol. 1.</ref><ref>See Perry (p. 150), Riley-Smith (p. 237, Baybars ... murdered Qutuz\"), Amitai-Preiss (p. 47, \"a conspiracy of amirs, which included Baybars and was probably under his leadership\"), Holt et al.</ref> (Baibars \"came to power with [the] regicide [of Qutuz] on his conscience\" according to Tschanz.) Despite this, Baibars was named sultan, and in 1263 sacked Nazareth, threatened Antioch with invasion, and appeared before the walls of Acre. In January 1265 Baibars launched an offensive against the Latins, starting with Acre, the capital of the remnant of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], but was unable to take it, but defeated the Crusaders in many other battles in Arsuf, Athlith, Haifa, etc. And in 1268 Baibars besieged Antioch, capturing the city on May 18. Baibars promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants, but broke his promise and razed the city, killing or enslaving nearly the entire population upon their surrender.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224216/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 |date=2009-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nAntioch's ruler, [[Bohemond VI of Antioch|Prince Bohemond VI]] was then left with no territories except the County of Tripoli.

Many of these mosaics were originally displayed as floor mosaics in private homes during the 2nd through 6th centuries A.D., while others were displayed in baths and other public buildings.

The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the [[spice trade]], the [[Silk Road]], and the [[Royal Road]]. It eventually rivaled [[Alexandria]] as the chief city of the Near East. The city was the capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]] until 63 B.C. when the Romans took control, making it the seat of the governor of the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]]. From the early 4th century, the city was the seat of the Count of the Orient, head of the regional administration of sixteen provinces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was also the main center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] at the end of the [[Second Temple period]].

A single route proceeds south in the Orontes valley.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe settlement called Meroe pre-dated Antioch. A shrine of the Semitic goddess [[Anat]], called by Herodotus the \"[[Achaemenid empire|Persian]] [[Artemis]]\", was located here. This site was included in the eastern suburbs of Antioch. There was a village on the spur of Mount Silpius named ''Io'', or ''[[Iopolis]]''. This name was always adduced as evidence by Antiochenes (''e.g.'' [[Libanius]]) anxious to affiliate themselves to the Attic [[Ionians]]\u2014an eagerness which is illustrated by the Athenian types used on the city's coins. Io may have been a small early colony of trading Greeks ([[Javan]]). [[John Malalas]] also mentions an archaic village, [[Bottia]], in the plain by the river.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\n===Foundation by Seleucus I===\n[[Alexander the Great]] is said to have camped on the site of Antioch, and dedicated an altar to [[Zeus]] Bottiaeus; it lay in the northwest of the future city.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}} This account is found<ref>{{cite book|title=Antioch as a Centre of Hellenic Culture as Observed by Libanius|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fscXhWwDbusC&pg=PA23 |year=2000|place=Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool University Press|others=Translated with an introduction by A.F.

An [[eagle]], the bird of Zeus, had been given a piece of sacrificial meat and the city was founded on the site to which the eagle carried the offering.  Seleucus did this on the 22nd day of the month of Artemisios in the twelfth year of his reign (equivalent to May 300 BC).<ref>[[John Malalas]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#199 Book 8, pp.199\u2013202]</ref> Antioch soon rose above [[Seleucia Pieria]] to become the Syrian capital.\n\n===Hellenistic age===\nThe original city of Seleucus was laid out in imitation of the [[grid plan]] of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] by the architect [[Xenarius]]. Libanius describes the first building and arrangement of this city (i. p.&nbsp;300. 17). The citadel was on Mt. Silpius and the city lay mainly on the low ground to the north, fringing the river. Two great colonnaded streets intersected in the centre. Shortly afterwards a second quarter was laid out, probably on the east and by [[Antiochus I]], which, from an expression of [[Strabo]], appears to have been the native, as contrasted with the Greek, town. It was enclosed by a wall of its own.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\nIn the Orontes, north of the city, lay a large island, and on this [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] began a third walled \"city\", which was finished by [[Antiochus III]]. A fourth and last quarter was added by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (175\u2013164&nbsp;BC); thenceforth Antioch was known as ''Tetrapolis''. From west to east the whole was about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} in diameter and a little less from north to south. This area included many large gardens.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}\n\nThe new city was populated by a mix of local settlers that Athenians brought from the nearby city of Antigonia, Macedonians, and Jews (who were given full status from the beginning). The total free population of Antioch at its foundation has been estimated at between 17,000 and 25,000, not including slaves and native settlers.<ref name=\"ebd\"/> During the late Hellenistic period and Early Roman period, Antioch's population reached its peak of over 500,000 inhabitants (estimates generally are 200,000 250,000) and was the third largest city in the Empire after Rome and Alexandria. In the second half of the 4th century Libanius gives the figure 150,000 and John Chrysostom, 200,000 (without children and slaves counted)<ref>A.H.M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, Vol. II 1984 pp. 1040 and 1409 {{ISBN|0-8018-3354-X}}</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} west and beyond the suburb Heraclea lay the paradise of Daphne, a park of woods and waters, in the midst of which rose a great temple to the Pythian Apollo, also founded by Seleucus I and enriched with a cult-statue of the god, as Musagetes, by [[Bryaxis]]. A companion sanctuary of Hecate was constructed underground by [[Diocletian]]. The beauty and the lax morals of Daphne were celebrated all over the western world; and indeed Antioch as a whole shared in both these titles to fame.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|pp=130-131}}\n\nAntioch became the capital and court-city of the western Seleucid empire under [[Antiochus I]], its counterpart in the east being [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]; but its paramount importance dates from the battle of Ancyra (240&nbsp;BC), which shifted the Seleucid centre of gravity from Asia Minor, and led indirectly to the rise of [[Pergamum]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\nThe Seleucids reigned from Antioch. We know little of it in the [[Hellenistic period]], apart from [[Syria]], all our information coming from authors of the late Roman time. Among its great Greek buildings we hear only of the theatre, of which substructures still remain on the flank of Silpius, and of the royal palace, probably situated on the island. It enjoyed a reputation for being \"a populous city, full of most erudite men and rich in the most liberal studies\",<ref>[[Cicero]] ''[[Pro Archia]]'', 4</ref> but the only names of distinction in these pursuits during the Seleucid period that have come down to us are Apollophanes, the Stoic, and one Phoebus, a writer on dreams. The nicknames which they gave to their later kings were Aramaic; and, except [[Apollo]] and [[Daphne]], the great divinities of north Syria seem to have remained essentially native, such as the \"Persian Artemis\" of Meroe and [[Atargatis]] of [[Hierapolis Bambyce]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\nThe epithet \"Golden\" suggests that the external appearance of Antioch was impressive, but the city needed constant restoration owing to the [[earthquake|seismic disturbances]] to which the district has always been subjected. The first great earthquake in recorded history was related by the native chronicler [[John Malalas]]. It occurred in 148&nbsp;BC and did immense damage.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}<ref>[[John Malalas]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#207 Book 8, pp.207\u2013208]</ref>\n\nLocal politics were turbulent. In the many dissensions of the Seleucid house the population took sides, and frequently rose in rebellion, for example against [[Alexander Balas]] in 147&nbsp;BC, and [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]] in 129&nbsp;BC. The latter, enlisting a body of Jews, punished his capital with fire and sword. In the last struggles of the Seleucid house, Antioch turned against its feeble rulers, invited [[Tigranes the great|Tigranes of Armenia]] to occupy the city in 83&nbsp;BC, tried to unseat [[Antiochus XIII]] in 65&nbsp;BC, and petitioned Rome against his restoration in the following year. Antioch's wish prevailed, and it passed with Syria to the [[Roman Republic]] in 64&nbsp;BC, but remained a ''civitas libera''.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\n===Roman period===\n[[File:Ancient Roman road of Tall Aqibrin.jpg|thumb|250px|Ancient [[Roman road]] located in [[Syria]] which connected Antioch and [[Chalcis, Syria|Chalcis]].]]\n[[File:Argenteus-Constantius I-antioch RIC 033a.jpg|thumb|250px|This [[argenteus]] was struck in the Antioch mint, under [[Constantius Chlorus]].]]\n[[File:Domitian Tetradrachm 1.jpg|alt=Domitian Tetradrachm from Antioch Mint|thumb|250x250px|Rare Domitian Tetradrachm struck in the Antioch Mint.

To a certain extent they tried to make it an eastern Rome. [[Julius Caesar]] visited it in 47&nbsp;BC, and confirmed its freedom. A great temple to Jupiter Capitolinus rose on Silpius, probably at the insistence of [[Augustus|Octavian]], whose cause the city had espoused. A [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of Roman type was laid out. [[Tiberius]] built two long colonnades on the south towards Silpius.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\n[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and Tiberius enlarged the theatre, and [[Trajan]] finished their work. [[Antoninus Pius]] paved the great east to west artery with granite. [[Circus of Antioch|A circus]], other colonnades and great numbers of baths were built, and new [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]] to supply them bore the names of Caesars, the finest being the work of [[Hadrian]]. The Roman client, King Herod (most likely the great builder [[Herod the Great]]), erected a long ''[[stoa]]'' on the east, and Agrippa (c. 63&nbsp;BC{{snd}}12&nbsp;BC) encouraged the growth of a new suburb south of this.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}<!---whatever Herod needs linking (my strong guess is [[Herod the Great]], what other Herod had this power?, also the Agrippa time period is right)--->\n\nOne of the most famous urban additions to Antioch, done by the Romans probably under Augustus when the city had more than half a million inhabitants, was the '''Circus of Antioch''': it was a Roman [[hippodrome]].

Antioch had a mixed pagan and Christian population, which [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] implies lived quite harmoniously together. However Julian's visit began ominously as it coincided with a lament for [[Adonis]], the doomed lover of [[Aphrodite]]. Thus, Ammianus wrote, the emperor and his soldiers entered the city not to the sound of cheers but to wailing and screaming.\n\nAfter being advised that the bones of 3rd-century martyred bishop [[Babylas of Antioch|Babylas]] were suppressing the oracle of Apollo at Daphne,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |title=St John Chrysostom's homily on Saint Babylas |access-date=2012-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706194336/http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.12.8{{snd}}22.13.3</ref><ref>[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 3.18</ref>\n\nJulian found much else about which to criticize the Antiochene;  Julian had wanted the empire's cities to be more self-managing, as they had been some [[Antonines|200&nbsp;years before]]. However Antioch's [[Decurion (administrative)|city councilmen]] showed themselves unwilling to shore up Antioch's food shortage with their own resources, so dependent were they on the emperor. Ammianus wrote that the councilmen shirked their duties by bribing unwitting men in the marketplace to do the job for them.\n\nThe city's impiety to the old religion was clear to Julian when he attended the city's annual feast of Apollo. To his surprise and dismay the only Antiochene present was an old priest clutching a goose.\n\nThe Antiochenes in turn hated Julian for worsening the food shortage with the burden of his [[billet]]ed troops, wrote [[Ammianus]]. The soldiers were often to be found gorged on sacrificial meat, making a drunken nuisance of themselves on the streets while Antioch's hungry citizens looked on in disgust. The Christian Antiochenes and Julian's pagan [[Gauls|Gallic]] soldiers also never quite saw eye to eye.\n\nEven Julian's piety was distasteful to the Antiochenes even to those who kept the old religion. Julian's brand of paganism was very much unique to himself, with little support outside the most educated [[Neo Platonism|Neoplatonist]] circles.

Bohemond was outwitted by Alexius, who deployed his forces to cut the invaders' supply lines whilst avoiding direct confrontation. The Latins were weakened by hunger and proved unable to break Durazzo's defenses. Bohemond capitulated in September 1108 and was forced to accede to a peace accord, the [[Treaty of Devol]]. The terms of this agreement stipulated that Bohemond was to hold Antioch for the remainder of his life as the emperor's subject and the Greek patriarch was to be restored to power in the city. However Tancred refused to honor the Treaty of Devol in which Bohemond swore an oath, and it is not until 1158 that it truly became a [[vassal]] state of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>The Crusades The War For The Holy Land by Thomas Asbridge page 114 (p.3) to page 115</ref><ref>Ibn al-Athir vol. 2, p. 320; Hillenbrand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Antioch&f=false The Crusades: Islamic perspectives], pp. 175\u201385</ref> Six months after the [[Treaty of Devol]] Bohemond died, and Tancred remained regent of Antioch until his death during a typhoid epidemic in 1112.\n\nAfter the death of Tancred, the principality passed to [[Roger of Salerno]], who helped rebuild Antioch after an earthquake destroyed its foundations in 1114.

Alice was then expelled from Antioch. With the death of Balwin in 1131, Alice briefly took control of Antioch and allied herself with [[Pons of Tripoli]] and [[Joscelin II of Edessa]] in an attempt to prevent [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem]] from marching north in 1132, however this attempt failed and Fulk and Pons fought a brief battle before peace was made and Alice was exiled again.

The engagement lasted until 1137 when emperor John II arrived with an army before the walls of Antioch. Although the [[basileus]] did not enter the city, his banner was raised atop the citadel and Raymond was compelled to do homage. Raymond agreed with the emperor that if he was capable of capturing [[Aleppo]], [[Shaizar]], and [[Homs]], he would exchange Antioch for them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Annales Herbipolenses]]'', s.a. 1147: A Hostile View of the Crusade</ref>\n\nJohn went on to attack Aleppo with the aid of Antioch and Edessa, and failed to capture it, with the Franks withdrawing their support when he moved on to capture Shaizar. John returned to Antioch ahead of his army and entered Antioch, only to be forced to leave when [[Joscelin II, Count of Edessa]] rallied the citizens to oust him.

Zangi attacked Antioch in both 1147 and 1148 and succeeded during the second venture in occupying most of the territory east of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] including [[Artah]], [[Kafr Latah|Kafar Latha]], Basarfut, and Balat, but failing to capture Antioch itself. With the Second Crusades army previously nearly entirely defeated by the Turks and by sickness, [[Louis VII of France]] arrived in Antioch on March 19, 1148 after being delayed by storms. Louis was welcomed by the uncle of his spouse [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], Raymond of Poitiers.\n\nLouis refused to help Antioch defend against the Turks and to lead an expedition against Aleppo, and instead decided to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the Crusades. With Louis quickly leaving Antioch again and the Crusades returning home in 1149,<ref>The Crusades: A Documentary Survey Brundage</ref> Nur ad-Din launched an offensive against the territories which were dominated by the Castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the Orontes, after which Nur besieged the castle of Inag.

In 1152 [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] came of age, but from 1150 he had proposed three different but respectable suitors for Constance's hand in marriage, all of whom she rejected. In 1153 however, she chose [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] and married him in secret without consulting her first cousin and liege lord, Baldwin III, and neither Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges approved of her choice.<ref>Les Familles d'Outremer</ref>\n\nIn 1156 Raynald claimed that the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] had reneged on his promises to pay Raynald a sum of money, and vowed to attack the island of Cyprus in revenge. However Aimery refused to finance Raynald's expedition, so in turn Raynald had the Patriarch seized, beaten, stripped naked, covered in honey, and had him left in the burning sun on top of the citadel to be attacked by insects. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition.<ref>od's War: A New History of the Crusade</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Raynald had allied himself with the Armenian prince, [[Thoros II, Prince of Armenia|Thoros II]]. In 1156 Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island over a three-week period, with [[Wiktionary:rapine|rapine]], killing, and plundering its citizens. After which, [[Manuel I Comnenus]] raised an army and began their march towards Syria, as a result Raynald threw himself to the mercy of the emperor who insisted on the installation of a Greek Patriarch and the surrender of the citadel in Antioch. The following spring, Manuel made a triumphant entry into the city and established himself as the unquestioned [[suzerain]] of Antioch.\n\nIn 1160 Raynald was captured by Muslims during a plundering raid against the Syrian and Armenian peasants of the neighborhood of [[Marash]]. He was held captive for sixteen years, and as the stepfather of the Empress Maria, he was ransomed by Manuel for 120,000 [[gold dinar]]s in 1176 (about 500&nbsp;kg of gold, worth approximately \u00a316 million or US$26 million {{as of|2010|October|lc=y}}). With Raynald disposed of for a long time, the patriarch Aimery became the new regent, chosen by Baldwin III. To further consolidate his own claim over Antioch, Manuel chose [[Maria of Antioch]] as his bride, daughter of [[Constance of Antioch]] and [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. But the government of Antioch remained in crisis up until 1163, when Constance asked the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] to help maintain her rule, as a result the citizens of Antioch exiled her and installed her son [[Bohemond III]] and now brother-in-law to the emperor, as regent.<ref>Religious and Military Crusader Orders in Syria in the 12th and 13th Centuries.

Bohemond III was soon released, however [[Harem, Syria]] which Raynald had recaptured in 1158, was lost again and the frontier of Antioch was permanently placed west of the Orontes. Byzantine influence remained in Antioch and in 1165, Bohemond III married a niece of the emperor, [[Maria of Antioch]], and installed a Greek patriarch in the city, [[Athanasius II, Patriarch of Antioch]], who remained in his position until he died in an earthquake five years later.<ref>Seeing Islam as Others Saw\nAthanasius II</ref><ref>Earthquakes in Syria during the Crusades.

However Bohemond installed his younger, the future prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], as count of Tripoli. Shortly after the end of the Third Crusade, Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli married [[Alice of Armenia]], the niece of Leo II, or [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], and a vassal to Antioch. Alice bore Raymond IV a son in 1199, [[Raymond-Roupen]], after which Raymond IV died in the coming months. In 1194 Leo II tricked Bohemond III making him believe that the new born prince had been captured by the Roupenians. Leo made a failed attempt at capturing Antioch believing the city would be weakened with the absence of Bohemond.\n\n[[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] nephew to both Richard I and Philip II, travelled to [[Lesser Armenia]] and managed to persuade Leo that in exchange for Antioch, renouncing its overlordship to Lesser Armenia and to release Bohemond, who in 1201 died. With the death of Bohemond III there followed a 15-year struggle for power of Antioch, between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia. According to the rules of [[primogeniture]] Leo's great nephew Raymond-Roupen was the rightful heir of Antioch, and Leo's position was supported by the pope. However, on the other hand, the city commune of Antioch supported [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], on the grounds that he was the closest blood relative to the last ruling prince, Bohemond III. In 1207 Bohemond IV installed a Greek patriarch in Antioch, despite the [[East-West Schism]], under the help of Aleppo, Bohemond IV drove Leo out of Antioch.<ref>A short history of Antioch, 300&nbsp;B.C.-A.D. 1268 (1921)</ref><ref>Riley-Smith, Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</ref>\n\n====Fifth Crusade and afterwards====\n{{See also|Armeno-Mongol relations}}\nIn 1213 [[Pope Innocent III]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'' called for all of Christendom to lead a new (Fifth) crusade. This strengthened the support of [[sultan]] [[al-Adil I]] (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644), an [[Ayyubid]]-Egyptian general who supported Raymond-Roupen's claims in Antioch. In 1216 Leo installed Raymond-Roupen as prince of Antioch, and ending all military aspect of the struggle between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia, but the citizens again revolted against Raymond-Roupen in c. 1219 and Bohemond of Tripoli was recognised as the fourth prince of that name. Bohemond IV and his son Bohemond V remained neutral in the struggles of the [[Ghibellines|Guelphs and Ghibellines]] to the south which arose when Frederich II married Isabella II, and in 1233 Bohemond IV died.\n\nFrom 1233 onwards Antioch declined and appeared rarely in records for 30&nbsp;years, and in 1254 the altercations of the past between Antioch and Armenia were laid to rest when [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]] married the then 17\u2011year\u2011old [[Sibylla of Armenia]], and Bohemond VI became a vassal of the Armenian kingdom. Effectively, the Armenian kings ruled Antioch while the prince of Antioch resided in Tripoli. The Armenians drew up a treaty with the Mongols, who were now ravaging Muslim lands, and under protection they extended their territory into the lands of the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the north and the Aleppo territory to the south. Antioch was part of this Armeno-Mongol alliance. Bohemond VI managed to retake Lattakieh and reestablished the land bridge between Antioch and Tripoli, while the Mongols insisted he install the Greek patriarch there rather than a Latin one, due to the Mongols attempting to strengthen ties with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This earned Bohemond the enmity of the Latins of Acre, and Bohemond was excommunicated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Pope Urban IV]],<ref>Runciman, pp. 306\u2013307. \"To the Latins at Acre Bohemond's subservience seemed disgraceful, especially as it involved the humiliation of the Latin Church at Antioch...Bohemond was excommunicated by the Pope for this alliance (Urban IV, Registres, 26 May 1263)</ref> which was later suspended.<ref>Jean Richard, The Crusades: c. 1071{{snd}}c. 1291, pp 423\u2013426</ref><ref>\"Ghazan resumed his plans against Egypt in 1297: the Franco-Mongol cooperation had thus survived, in spite of the loss of Acre by the Franks, and the conversion of the Persian Mongols to Islam.

All previous buildings, including a necropolis, were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of [[Ramses II]].<ref name=lambert>{{cite book |title=Beloved and God: The Story of Hadrian and Antinous |last=Lambert |first=Royston |year=1984 |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location= |isbn= }}{{rp|149}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antino\u00f6polis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, [[Bes]], to continue to be worshipped in Antino\u00f6polis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antino\u00fcs.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|150}} He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|199}} The city was designed on a [[Gridiron plan|gridiron]] plan that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antino\u00fcs, as well as a temple devoted to the deity.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|200-2}}\n\nThe city of Antino\u00f6polis was the centre of the official cult of [[Antinous|Antino\u00fcs]]. The city exhibited the [[Graeco-Roman]] architecture of [[Hadrian]]'s age in immediate contrast with the [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian style]]. Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antino\u00fcs. Known as the ''Antinoeia'', they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|149; 205}} Divine honours were paid in the ''Antinoeion'' to Antino\u00fcs as a local deity, and games and chariot-races were annually exhibited in commemoration of his death and of [[Hadrian]]'s sorrow.

The senate was chosen from the members of the wards ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03af}}), of which we learn the name of one &ndash; {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u0390\u03c2}} &ndash; from inscriptions (Orelli, No. 4705); and its decrees, as well as those of the ''prytaneus'', were not, as usual, subject to the revision of the [[nome (Egypt)|nomarch]], but to that of the prefect ({{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}}) of the [[Thebaid]]. Antino\u00f6polis first belonged to the [[Heptanomis]], but under [[Diocletian]] (286 AD) Antino\u00f6polis became the capital of the [[Nome (Egypt)|''nome'']] of the [[Thebaid]].\n\nAntino\u00eb was the seat of a Christian bishop by the 4th century, originally a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Ptolemais Hermiou|Ptolemais in Thebaide]], but it became a metropolitan see itself in the 5th century, having as suffragans [[Damanhur|Herrmopolis Parva]], [[Cusae]], [[Lycopolis]], [[Thebaid#Episcopal sees|Hypselis]], [[Thebaid#Episcopal sees|Apollonopolis Parva]], [[Tjebu|Antaeopolis]], [[Panopolis]] and [[Theodosiopolis in Arcadia|Theodosiopolis]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 593-594</ref><ref>Gaetano Moroni, ''Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7QAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA168 Vol. 2], p.&nbsp;168</ref><ref>Klaas A.

A grotto, once inhabited by [[Christians|Christian]] [[anchorite]]s, probably marks the seat of the shrine and oracle, and [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]] tombs with inscriptions point to the [[necropolis]] of Antino\u00f6polis. The ruins of Antino\u00f6polis attest, by the area which they fill, the ancient grandeur of the city. The direction of the principal streets may still be traced.  The streets were built on a grid plan with roads intersecting at right angles, like the majority of Roman cities at this time, and Jomard, a member of Napoleon's ''Commission d\u2019Egypte'' found that the streets were divided into quarters and blocks, with each building being conveniently numbered.<ref name=bell>Bell, H. I. (1940).\"Antinoopolis: A Hadrianic Foundation in Egypt.\" The Journal of Roman Studies, 133-47. {{jstor|296979}}</ref>. One at least of them, which ran from north to south, had on either side of it a corridor supported by columns for the convenience of foot-passengers. The walls of the theatre near the southern gate, and those of the hippodrome without the walls to the east, are still extant. At the north-western extremity of the city was a portico, of which four columns remain, inscribed to Good Fortune, and bearing the date of the 14th and last year of the reign of [[Alexander Severus]], 235 AD.\n\nAs far as can be ascertained from the space covered with mounds of masonry, Antino\u00f6polis was about a mile and a half in length, and nearly half a mile broad. The remains of the city, having a three and a half mile circumference, suggests Roman and Hellenistic foundations and was surrounded by a brick wall on three sides, leaving the fourth side open to the Nile.<ref name=bell/>. Near the [[Hippodrome]] are a well and tanks appertaining to an ancient road, which leads from the eastern gate to a valley behind the town, ascends the mountains, and, passing through the desert by the W\u00e1dee Tarfa, joins the roads to the quarries of the ''Mons Porphyrites''.<ref>Wilkinson, ''Topography of Thebes'', p.&nbsp;382</ref> At the beginning of the 19th century, when [[Napoleon]]ic surveys were made, a theatre, many temples, a triumphal arch, two streets with double colonnades, (illustrated in ''[[Description de l'Egypte]]'') a circus, and a hippodrome nearby, were still to be seen.\n[[File:Antino\u00eb (Antino\u00f6polis) Vue des ruines de la ville, prise du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du sud-ouest.jpg|center|thumb|880x880px|View of the Antino\u00f6polis ruin-field from the south-west in 1809, from [[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]].]]\n\n===Albert Gayet===\n[[File:Antino\u00eb (Antino\u00f6polis).

Though there is much data of Antino\u00f6polis recorded from the Napoleonic ''Commission'', Gayet's report sheds a greater light on the ancient city. As Christianity began to spread through the Roman Empire, Antino\u00f6polis became a place of worship. Centuries after the city of Antino\u00fcs was established by the Roman emperor, Christianity became the way of life. The city was home to many nuns and monks and Christian sanctuaries were built. Many came to worship saints, such as Claudius and Colluthus, and monasteries were abundant.<ref>Donadoni, Sergio, and Peter Grossmann. (1991).

Retrieved 10/24/2012.</ref> Gayet's findings confirm the wide spread of Christianity. Gayet's excavations have revealed mummies, grave goods, and thousands of fabrics at the site of Antino\u00f6polis. Gayet uncovered a large cemetery, the burial place of numerous Coptic Christians. Mummification was prohibited by law in the fourth century A.D., and so the remains of deceased Christians were dressed in tunics and swaddled with other textiles before being buried.<ref>Hoskins, Nancy A.

In its place is El Sheikh Ibada, a small mud village surrounded by the crumbled ruins of what was once a city of worship. There is not much left of the ancient city, as many buildings had their materials taken to build newer structures, such as sugar factories for El-Rodah, but visitors can still see the remains of the Roman Circus and ruins of a few temples.<ref name=stillwell1976/> Unfortunately the local inhabitants are today (2015) bulldozing the circus to extend a Muslim cemetery.\nSome excavations were undertaken by the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], 1965\u201368, with [[Sergio Donadoni]].

All previous buildings, including a necropolis, were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of [[Ramses II]].<ref name=lambert>{{cite book |title=Beloved and God: The Story of Hadrian and Antinous |last=Lambert |first=Royston |year=1984 |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location= |isbn= }}{{rp|149}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antino\u00f6polis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, [[Bes]], to continue to be worshipped in Antino\u00f6polis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antino\u00fcs.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|150}} He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|199}} The city was designed on a [[Gridiron plan|gridiron]] plan that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antino\u00fcs, as well as a temple devoted to the deity.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|200-2}}\n\nThe city of Antino\u00f6polis was the centre of the official cult of [[Antinous|Antino\u00fcs]]. The city exhibited the [[Graeco-Roman]] architecture of [[Hadrian]]'s age in immediate contrast with the [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian style]]. Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antino\u00fcs. Known as the ''Antinoeia'', they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance.<ref name=lambert/>{{rp|149; 205}} Divine honours were paid in the ''Antinoeion'' to Antino\u00fcs as a local deity, and games and chariot-races were annually exhibited in commemoration of his death and of [[Hadrian]]'s sorrow.

A grotto, once inhabited by [[Christians|Christian]] [[anchorite]]s, probably marks the seat of the shrine and oracle, and [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]] tombs with inscriptions point to the [[necropolis]] of Antino\u00f6polis. The ruins of Antino\u00f6polis attest, by the area which they fill, the ancient grandeur of the city. The direction of the principal streets may still be traced.  The streets were built on a grid plan with roads intersecting at right angles, like the majority of Roman cities at this time, and Jomard, a member of Napoleon\u2019s ''Commission d\u2019Egypte'' found that the streets were divided into quarters and blocks, with each building being conveniently numbered.<ref name=bell>Bell, H. I. (1940).\"Antinoopolis: A Hadrianic Foundation in Egypt.\" The Journal of Roman Studies, 133-47. {{jstor|296979}}</ref>. One at least of them, which ran from north to south, had on either side of it a corridor supported by columns for the convenience of foot-passengers. The walls of the theatre near the southern gate, and those of the hippodrome without the walls to the east, are still extant. At the north-western extremity of the city was a portico, of which four columns remain, inscribed to Good Fortune, and bearing the date of the 14th and last year of the reign of [[Alexander Severus]], 235 AD.\n\nAs far as can be ascertained from the space covered with mounds of masonry, Antino\u00f6polis was about a mile and a half in length, and nearly half a mile broad. The remains of the city, having a three and a half mile circumference, suggests Roman and Hellenistic foundations and was surrounded by a brick wall on three sides, leaving the fourth side open to the Nile.<ref name=bell/>. Near the [[Hippodrome]] are a well and tanks appertaining to an ancient road, which leads from the eastern gate to a valley behind the town, ascends the mountains, and, passing through the desert by the W\u00e1dee Tarfa, joins the roads to the quarries of the ''Mons Porphyrites''.<ref>Wilkinson, ''Topography of Thebes'', p.&nbsp;382</ref> At the beginning of the 19th century, when [[Napoleon]]ic surveys were made, a theatre, many temples, a triumphal arch, two streets with double colonnades, (illustrated in ''[[Description de l'Egypte]]'') a circus, and a hippodrome nearby, were still to be seen.\n[[File:Antino\u00eb (Antino\u00f6polis) Vue des ruines de la ville, prise du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du sud-ouest.jpg|center|thumb|880x880px|View of the Antino\u00f6polis ruin-field from the south-west in 1809, from [[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]].]]\n\n===Albert Gayet===\n[[File:Antino\u00eb (Antino\u00f6polis).

Though there is much data of Antino\u00f6polis recorded from the Napoleonic ''Commission'', Gayet\u2019s report sheds a greater light on the ancient city. As Christianity began to spread through the Roman Empire, Antino\u00f6polis became a place of worship. Centuries after the city of Antino\u00fcs was established by the Roman emperor, Christianity became the way of life. The city was home to many nuns and monks and Christian sanctuaries were built. Many came to worship saints, such as Claudius and Colluthus, and monasteries were abundant.<ref>Donadoni, Sergio, and Peter Grossmann. (1991).

Gayet\u2019s excavations have revealed mummies, grave goods, and thousands of fabrics at the site of Antino\u00f6polis. Gayet uncovered a large cemetery, the burial place of numerous Coptic Christians. Mummification was prohibited by law in the fourth century A.D., and so the remains of deceased Christians were dressed in tunics and swaddled with other textiles before being buried.<ref>Hoskins, Nancy A.

In its place is El Sheikh Ibada, a small mud village surrounded by the crumbled ruins of what was once a city of worship. There is not much left of the ancient city, as many buildings had their materials taken to build newer structures, such as sugar factories for El-Rodah, but visitors can still see the remains of the Roman Circus and ruins of a few temples.<ref name=stillwell1976/> Unfortunately the local inhabitants are today (2015) bulldozing the circus to extend a Muslim cemetery.\nSome excavations were undertaken by the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], 1965-68, with [[Sergio Donadoni]].

Wheels of this type are used on many modern racing cars, including [[NASCAR]], [[Formula One]] and [[Sports car racing|racing sports cars]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/02/nascar-single-lug-nut-design-wheel-next-gen-car/|title=NASCAR moving to single lug-nut design for Next Gen car {{!}} NASCAR|last=Albert|first=Zack|date=2020-03-02|website=Official Site Of NASCAR|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-center-locking-wheels-nut/4711048/?nrt=119|title=NASCAR shifts to center-locking wheels for 2021|last=DeGroot|first=Nick|date=2 March 2020|website=us.motorsport.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2009_997_GT3_19-inch_wheel_with_central_locking_device.jpg|alt=A modern centerlock wheel mounted on a 2009 Porsche 997 GT3|thumb|A modern centerlock wheel mounted on a 2009 [[Porsche 997 GT3]], with Porsche-specific fastener]]\n\nSome variation among the design of the centerlock mechanism is seen among manufacturers.
