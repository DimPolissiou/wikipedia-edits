Schaefer batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nIn 2005, Schaefer received the Distinguished Alumni Award from UConn, primarily for his achievements on that College World Series team.\n\nHE IS ALSO A SUPER GRUMPY OLD FART AND A BAND TEACHER\n\n==Coaching and managing career==\nTwice, Schaefer has served as the interim pilot of the [[Kansas City Royals]]. In 1991, he was interim manager during the period between managers [[John Wathan]] and [[Hal McRae]]. In 2005, he succeeded [[Tony Pe\u00f1a]] on May 11 and served through May 30. On May 31, 2005, [[Buddy Bell]] took the reins as permanent manager and Schaefer returned to the bench coach position. Schaefer's position with the Royals was terminated at the end of the 2005 season, the worst in Royals history.\n\nHe began his managerial career in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], where he won numerous awards. He was twice named Manager of the Year (in 1980 and 1981) at Class A [[Greensboro Grasshoppers|Greensboro]], then a part of the [[New York Yankees]] organization. He also managed the [[New York Mets]]' Class AAA team in [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater]] to an [[International League]] championship in 1985.\n\nHe first joined the Royals organization in 1987, managing the Class AA [[Memphis Chicks]]. His first major-league job was as the Royals' [[Coach (baseball)|first base coach]] from 1988 to 1990, then he was the Royals' bench coach in 1991. He worked as a special assignment scout with the Royals in 1992.\n\nSchaefer then moved on to the [[Boston Red Sox]] organization, serving as a special assignment scout and later the director of player development from 1994 to the midseason of 1998. During that time, he hired [[Bob Geren]] as a manager in the Boston farm system; a decade later, when Geren was named the 2007 manager of the [[Oakland Athletics]], he brought Schaefer to Oakland as bench coach on his staff.\n\nAlthough Schaefer received positive notices for his work as the Red Sox' player development chief, he clashed with [[general manager]] [[Dan Duquette]] and was fired during the summer of 1998; several minor league managers and coaches, including Geren, departed the organization with Schaefer, who spent the next three years as a special assistant to the general manager of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] before returning to the Royals in 2001 as a bench coach and infielders coach.\n\nAfter his 2005 departure from Kansas City, he spent 2006 as a special assignment [[scout (sport)|scout]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]].

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public.

The USARS was intended to enhance [[Effectiveness#Usage|combat effectiveness]] by providing the opportunity for a regimental affiliation, thus obtaining some of the benefits of the traditional regimental system.\n\n==Overview==\nUSARS was developed to include the active Army (all combat arms battalions, separate companies, batteries, and troops; all combat support (CS), combat service support (CSS), and special branches, and appropriate training base battalions) and the reserve components (the [[Army National Guard]] and the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]).\n\nIt was developed to offer the opportunity for long-term identification with a regiment or corps, provide the potential for recurring assignments within a regiment or corps, provide the opportunity to further emphasize the history, customs, and traditions of the regiment or corps, and provide regiments that are structured as one or more continental United States (CONUS) units of like type linked with one or more units of like type outside the continental United States (OCONUS), or one or more units of like type located exclusively in either CONUS or OCONUS, including one or more training battalions or tactical armored cavalry or ranger regiments.\n\nUSARS is also designed to provide for CS, CSS, and special branches to operate on a \u201cwhole branch\u201d concept as a corps or special branch, carrying on the activities and traditions of a regiment, offer regimental affiliation to allow soldiers the opportunity for continuous identification with a combat arms regiment, a corps, or special branch throughout their careers. USARS provides (through regimental affiliation) different opportunities for soldiers, depending upon which combat arms regiment they choose to be affiliated with or whether they affiliate with a CS or CSS corps or special branch. In addition, the regimental affiliation process allows combat arms soldiers to select the regiment of choice (soldiers can change their affiliation at any time); provides that CS, CSS, and special branch soldiers will automatically be affiliated with their corps or special branch; specifies that all soldiers will belong to a regiment or corps; permits no limit to the number of soldiers who can be affiliated with a regiment or corps; and provides that DA civilians can automatically be affiliated with a regiment or corps by direction of the regiment or corps commander.\n\n== Combat arms ==\n\n=== Concept ===\nCombat arms is a rescinded doctrinal term, though colloquially it includes [[Air Defense Artillery Branch (United States Army)|air defense artillery]], [[armor]], [[aviation]], [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|field artillery]], [[infantry]], and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|special forces]] regiments. Combat arms soldiers may affiliate with any of the combat arms regiments consistent with their primary military occupational specialty (PMOS), specialty code, special qualification identifiers (SQI), or additional skill identifiers (ASI). Soldiers will have greater opportunities to serve recurring assignments in their regiments if regiments are chosen that have battalions in both CONUS and OCONUS locations. Since there is no ceiling on the number of soldiers who can affiliate with a particular regiment, the potential for recurring assignments to regiments is diminished where the number of affiliated soldiers exceeds the requirements.\n\n=== Affiliation policy ===\n\nQuoting from Chapter 3\u20132, page 7 of ''Army Regulation 600-82, U.S. Army Regimental System''\n(note: Army Regulation 600-82 has been superseded by Army Regulation 670-1):\n\n<blockquote>a. USARS regiments offered to active Army and USAR soldiers for affiliation are listed [below].\n\n: (1) All active Army soldiers are required to affiliate with a regiment. Although affiliation is mandatory, the choice of regiment is left up to the individual. Officers who are single-tracked in a Functional Area will affiliate with a regiment associated with their basic combat arms branch. Functional Area officers who have no basic branch will submit request for regimental affiliation using procedures outlined below. Regimental affiliation is based on the Army branch associated with a soldier\u2019s PMOS or specialty. AR 670\u20131 contains a listing of all PMOS and corresponding branches for each. Army recruiters who have been assigned the SQI\u201c4\u201d will affiliate with a regiment associated with their PMOS. Recruiters or retention noncommissioned officers (NCOs) will be affiliated with The Adjutant General Corps. Regimental affiliation may be changed at any time; however, the regimental selection must be associated with the soldier\u2019s PMOS or specialty.\n\n: (2) All combat arms officers and soldiers will affiliate with a regiment upon arrival at their first unit of assignment. These Soldiers will be affiliated with their regiment of assignment unless they voluntarily select another. Combat arms officers and soldiers whose initial Army assignment is not to a regimental unit may defer selection until they are so assigned.\n\n: (3) Enlisted soldiers may elect the Regiment of Choice Reenlistment Option under AR 601\u2013280.\n\n: (4) Soldiers who deliberately terminate [[Airborne forces|airborne]] status after affiliating with an airborne regiment will change their affiliation to a non-airborne regiment at the time of their termination. Those who are terminated for medical reasons may retain their regimental affiliation with an airborne regiment if they desire; however, such affiliation will be ceremonial and will not affect subsequent assignments.\n\n: (5) Regimental affiliation will be a primary assignment consideration for officers and enlisted soldiers. To the maximum extent possible, soldiers who are regimentally affiliated will be assigned to their regimental units. No assignment guarantees will be made, as Army requirements and soldier professional development needs must be met; however, it is incumbent upon commanders and the personnel community to make every effort to ensure that requisitions are submitted for and filled with affiliated regimental Soldiers and that soldiers are subsequently assigned within their regiments. (See AR 614\u2013100, and AR 614\u2013185 for officers, and AR 614\u2013200 for enlisted soldiers).\n\nb. Specific procedures for affiliation are below. These procedures permit affiliation and change of affiliation to be administered at the local Personnel Service Center (PSC) level.\n\nc. Active Army soldiers who are accessioned into the USAR will retain their regimental affiliation unless they elect to change their affiliation, which may be done at any time.</blockquote>\n\n== Combat arms regiments ==\n\nNote: There are currently 177 USARS regiments, with only 47 consisting of units at multiple locations. Only 27 of these regiments meet the USARS \"Conus/Oconus goal.\"\nAdditionally, the term \"Regiment\" was not officially appended to a USARS regiment's official name/ designation (and was not used unders CARS) until 2005.\n===Artillery regiments===\n\n====Air defense artillery ====\n\n*[[1st Air Defense Artillery (United States)|1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment]]\n** 1st Battalion, [[94th

The USARS was intended to enhance [[Effectiveness#Usage|combat effectiveness]] by providing the opportunity for a regimental affiliation, thus obtaining some of the benefits of the traditional regimental system.\n\n==Overview==\nUSARS was developed to include the active Army (all combat arms battalions, separate companies, batteries, and troops; all combat support (CS), combat service support (CSS), and special branches, and appropriate training base battalions) and the reserve components (the [[Army National Guard]] and the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]).\n\nIt was developed to offer the opportunity for long-term identification with a regiment or corps, provide the potential for recurring assignments within a regiment or corps, provide the opportunity to further emphasize the history, customs, and traditions of the regiment or corps, and provide regiments that are structured as one or more continental United States (CONUS) units of like type linked with one or more units of like type outside the continental United States (OCONUS), or one or more units of like type located exclusively in either CONUS or OCONUS, including one or more training battalions or tactical armored cavalry or ranger regiments.\n\nUSARS is also designed to provide for CS, CSS, and special branches to operate on a \u201cwhole branch\u201d concept as a corps or special branch, carrying on the activities and traditions of a regiment, offer regimental affiliation to allow soldiers the opportunity for continuous identification with a combat arms regiment, a corps, or special branch throughout their careers. USARS provides (through regimental affiliation) different opportunities for soldiers, depending upon which combat arms regiment they choose to be affiliated with or whether they affiliate with a CS or CSS corps or special branch. In addition, the regimental affiliation process allows combat arms soldiers to select the regiment of choice (soldiers can change their affiliation at any time); provides that CS, CSS, and special branch soldiers will automatically be affiliated with their corps or special branch; specifies that all soldiers will belong to a regiment or corps; permits no limit to the number of soldiers who can be affiliated with a regiment or corps; and provides that DA civilians can automatically be affiliated with a regiment or corps by direction of the regiment or corps commander.\n\n== Combat arms ==\n\n=== Concept ===\nCombat arms is a rescinded doctrinal term, though colloquially it includes [[Air Defense Artillery Branch (United States Army)|air defense artillery]], [[armor]], [[aviation]], [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|field artillery]], [[infantry]], and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|special forces]] regiments. Combat arms soldiers may affiliate with any of the combat arms regiments consistent with their primary military occupational specialty (PMOS), specialty code, special qualification identifiers (SQI), or additional skill identifiers (ASI). Soldiers will have greater opportunities to serve recurring assignments in their regiments if regiments are chosen that have battalions in both CONUS and OCONUS locations. Since there is no ceiling on the number of soldiers who can affiliate with a particular regiment, the potential for recurring assignments to regiments is diminished where the number of affiliated soldiers exceeds the requirements.\n\n=== Affiliation policy ===\n\nQuoting from Chapter 3\u20132, page 7 of ''Army Regulation 600-82, U.S. Army Regimental System''\n(note: Army Regulation 600-82 has been superseded by Army Regulation 670-1):\n\n<blockquote>a. USARS regiments offered to active Army and USAR soldiers for affiliation are listed [below].\n\n: (1) All active Army soldiers are required to affiliate with a regiment. Although affiliation is mandatory, the choice of regiment is left up to the individual. Officers who are single-tracked in a Functional Area will affiliate with a regiment associated with their basic combat arms branch. Functional Area officers who have no basic branch will submit request for regimental affiliation using procedures outlined below. Regimental affiliation is based on the Army branch associated with a soldier\u2019s PMOS or specialty. AR 670\u20131 contains a listing of all PMOS and corresponding branches for each. Army recruiters who have been assigned the SQI\u201c4\u201d will affiliate with a regiment associated with their PMOS. Recruiters or retention noncommissioned officers (NCOs) will be affiliated with The Adjutant General Corps. Regimental affiliation may be changed at any time; however, the regimental selection must be associated with the soldier\u2019s PMOS or specialty.\n\n: (2) All combat arms officers and soldiers will affiliate with a regiment upon arrival at their first unit of assignment. These Soldiers will be affiliated with their regiment of assignment unless they voluntarily select another. Combat arms officers and soldiers whose initial Army assignment is not to a regimental unit may defer selection until they are so assigned.\n\n: (3) Enlisted soldiers may elect the Regiment of Choice Reenlistment Option under AR 601\u2013280.\n\n: (4) Soldiers who deliberately terminate [[Airborne forces|airborne]] status after affiliating with an airborne regiment will change their affiliation to a non-airborne regiment at the time of their termination. Those who are terminated for medical reasons may retain their regimental affiliation with an airborne regiment if they desire; however, such affiliation will be ceremonial and will not affect subsequent assignments.\n\n: (5) Regimental affiliation will be a primary assignment consideration for officers and enlisted soldiers. To the maximum extent possible, soldiers who are regimentally affiliated will be assigned to their regimental units. No assignment guarantees will be made, as Army requirements and soldier professional development needs must be met; however, it is incumbent upon commanders and the personnel community to make every effort to ensure that requisitions are submitted for and filled with affiliated regimental Soldiers and that soldiers are subsequently assigned within their regiments. (See AR 614\u2013100, and AR 614\u2013185 for officers, and AR 614\u2013200 for enlisted soldiers).\n\nb. Specific procedures for affiliation are below. These procedures permit affiliation and change of affiliation to be administered at the local Personnel Service Center (PSC) level.\n\nc. Active Army soldiers who are accessioned into the USAR will retain their regimental affiliation unless they elect to change their affiliation, which may be done at any time.</blockquote>\n\n== Combat arms regiments ==\n\nNote: There are currently 177 USARS regiments, with only 47 consisting of units at multiple locations. Only 27 of these regiments meet the USARS \"Conus/Oconus goal.\"\nAdditionally, the term \"Regiment\" was not officially appended to a USARS regiment's official name/ designation (and was not used unders CARS) until 2005.\n===Artillery regiments===\n\n====Air defense artillery ====\n\n*[[1st Air Defense Artillery (United States)|1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment]]\n** 1st Battalion, [[94th

\"whole branch\" concept. It is the responsibility of all proponents to incorporate within their corps, the intent and spirit of the regimental system to provide soldiers the opportunity for affiliation.\n\nWhile this initiative mandates a uniform approach to regimental affiliation throughout the Army, it is a system that has no tradition within the Army and duplicates the sense of affiliation that CS, CSS, and special branch soldiers already had for their branch (Ordnance, Signal Corps, etc.)\n\n=== Branches ===\n====Combat support====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:U.S. Army Chemical Corps Regimental Insignia.gif|[[United States Army Chemical Corps|Chemical Corps]]\nFile:US-Engineers-Regimental Insignia.png|[[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]]\nFile:USArmyMilIntelCorpInsignia.png|[[Military Intelligence Corps]]\nFile:USAMPC-Regimental-Insignia.png|[[United States Army Military Police Corps|Military Police Corps]]\n\nFile:USArmySigCorRegInsignia.png|[[United States Army Signal Corps|Signal Corps]]\nFile:USArmyCivilAffairsCorpsRegI.png|[[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|Civil Affairs Corps]]\nFile:USArmyPsyOpsCorps-RegimentInsignia.png|[[Psychological Operations]] (2007)\n</gallery>\n\n====Combat service support====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:USAGBRRI.PNG|[[United States Army Adjutant General's Corps|Adjutant General's Corps]]\nFile:USArmyFinanceCorRegInsignia.png|[[Finance Corps]]\nFile:Ordnance Corps Regimental Insignia.gif|[[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]]\nFile:Quartermaster Corps Regimental Insignia.gif|[[U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps|Quartermaster Corps]]\nFile:Transportation Corps Regimental Insignia.gif|[[United States Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]]\nFile:USArmyAquisitionCorpsRegIns.png|Acquisition Corps (2008)\n</gallery>\n\n====Special====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:U.S. Army Medical Department Regimental Insignia.jpg|[[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]]\nFile:USArmyChapCorRegInsignia.png|[[Chaplain Corps (United States Army)|Chaplain Corps]]\nFile:USArmyJAGCorRegInsignia.png|[[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General's Corps]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* ''[http://www.17thinfantry.org/documents/dmor/AR%20600-82%20US%20ARMY%20Regimental%20System.pdf Army Regulation 600-82, U.S. Army Regimental System]'', 5 June 1990.

It is located on the south-eastern shores of the [[Manukau Harbour]], under authority of the [[Papakura District]] Council. The suburb makes up the southernmost part of the Auckland metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\n\nRecently, Pahurehure became recognised as an independent suburb. The previous area was referred to as a small area of greater [[Papakura]], but has now developed into a high class suburban area, stretching from north of Beach Road moving up to Ray Small Park on the eastern border and including the entire peninsula located on the western side of the [[Auckland Southern Motorway|southern motorway]].\n\nDuring the major reformation of local government in 1989, the Pahurehure area was included into the [[Papakura District]] boundaries.\n\nIn 2010, after a review of the [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]], the entire [[Auckland Region]] was amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as the former [[Papakura District]], all other territorial authorities were merged into a single [[Auckland Council]]. The suburb of Pahurehure is part of the [[Manurewa-Papakura ward]].\n\n==People==\n\nThe most common ethnic group in Pahurehure is [[Europe]]an as at 2006, with 75.6 percent. Maori residents only make up 10.6 percent of the suburb, and Asian residents consisting of 8.3 percent. According to the 2006 New Zealand census, (for residents aged 15 years and older) the most common occupational group in Pahurehure is 'Clerical and administrative workers', and the least common group is 'Machinery operators and drivers', with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent of the Pahurehure population.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Housing===\nPahurehure has several modern suburban styled houses. The area is similar to the nearby suburb of [[Rosehill, New Zealand|Rosehill]], and is known as the picturesque area of the district.

It is located on the south-eastern shores of the [[Manukau Harbour]], under authority of the [[Papakura District]] Council. The suburb makes up the southernmost part of the Auckland metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\n\nRecently Pahurehure became recognised as an independent suburb. The previous area was referred to as a small area of greater [[Papakura]], but has now developed into a high class suburban area, stretching from north of Beach Road moving up to Ray Small Park on the eastern border and including the entire peninsula located on the western side of the [[Auckland Southern Motorway|southern motorway]].\n\nDuring the major reformation of local government in 1989, the Pahurehure area was included into the [[Papakura District]] boundaries.\n\nIn 2010, after a review of the [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]], the entire [[Auckland Region]] was amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as the former [[Papakura District]], all other territorial authorities were merged into a single [[Auckland Council]]. The suburb of Pahurehure is part of the [[Manurewa-Papakura ward]].\n\n==People==\n\nThe most common ethnic group in Pahurehure is [[Europe]]an as at 2006, with 75.6 percent. Maori residents only make up 10.6 percent of the suburb, and Asian residents consisting of 8.3 percent. According to the 2006 New Zealand census, (for residents aged 15 years and older) the most common occupational group in Pahurehure is 'Clerical and administrative workers', and the least common group is 'Machinery operators and drivers', with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent of the Pahurehure population.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Housing===\nPahurehure has several modern suburban styled houses. The area is similar to the nearby suburb of [[Rosehill, New Zealand|Rosehill]], and is known as the picturesque area of the district. The surrounding areas in [[Hingaia]] and [[Karaka, New Zealand|Karaka]] has been heavily constructed into housing developments which has increased the local property values in Pahurehure.\n\n===Transport===\nAuckland's [[New Zealand State Highway 1|southern motorway]] runs straight through Pahurehure, with the main [[Papakura]] on and off ramps in the area also. Train and bus services provide the bulk of public transport in the [[Papakura]] Town Centre, a 5-minute drive away.\n\n===Recreation===\nRay Small Park serves the local children and sports teams in Pahurehure and [[Papakura]]. Also the Pahurehure Peninsula is right on the [[Manukau Harbour]], which has boat access in the local area.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.auckland.govt.nz Auckland Council]\n*[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/AboutAPlace/SnapShot.aspx?ParentID=1000002&type=au&tab=Income&id=3525540&p=y&printall=true Pahurehure Statistics]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n{{Coord|-37.067895|174.930662|display=title|format=dms}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Auckland]]\n[[Category:Populated places in the Auckland Region]]\n", "name_user": "Elanecadence", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahurehure"}

The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines the city of Bristol, Virginia, with neighboring [[Washington County, Virginia]], for statistical purposes. Bristol is a principal city of the [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]]\u2013[[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]]\u2013Bristol, TN-VA [[Kingsport-Bristol-Bristol, TN-VA MSA|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is a component of the [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]\u2013Kingsport\u2013Bristol, TN-VA [[Combined Statistical Area]] \u2013 commonly known as the \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" region. \n\n==History==\n\n[[Evan Shelby]] first appeared in what is now the Bristol area around 1765. In 1766, Shelby moved his family and settled at a place called Big Camp Meet (now Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia). It is said that [[Cherokee Indians]] once inhabited the area and the Indian village was named, according to legend, because numerous deer and buffalo met here to feast in the [[canebrakes]]. Shelby renamed the site Sapling Grove (which would later be changed to Bristol).  In 1774, Shelby erected a fort on a hill overlooking what is now downtown Bristol. It was an important stopping-off place for notables such as Daniel Boone and George Rogers Clark, as well as hundreds of pioneers\u2019 en route to the interior of the developing nation. This fort, known as Shelby's Station was actually a combination trading post, way station, and stockade.<ref name=discover>{{cite web|url=http://discoverbristol.org/history-of-bristol/|title=The History of Bristol|work=Discover Bristol|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, when surveyors projected a junction of two railroad lines at the Virginia-Tennessee state line, Reverend James King conveyed much of his acreage to his son-in-law, Joseph R. Anderson. Anderson laid out the original town of Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia and building began in 1853.<ref name=discover/>\n\nSamuel Goodson, who owned land that adjoined the original town of Bristol TN/VA at its northern boundary (Beaver Creek was the dividing line), started a development known as Goodsonville.  Anderson was unable to incorporate Bristol across the state lines of Tennessee and Virginia.  In 1856, Goodsonville and the original Bristol, Virginia were merged to form the composite town of Goodson, Virginia.<ref name=discover/>\n\nIncorporation for Bristol, Tennessee and Goodson, Virginia occurred in 1856. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroads reached the cities in the late summer of 1856. Due to having two different railroads companies, two depots served the cities; one in Bristol, Tenn. and the other in Goodson, Va. However, the depot located in Goodson continued to be referred to as Bristol, Virginia. In 1890, Goodson, Virginia once again took the name Bristol.<ref name=discover/>\n\n[[The Grove (Bristol, Virginia)|The Grove]], [[Solar Hill Historic District]], and [[Walnut Grove (Bristol, Virginia)|Walnut Grove]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBristol is located in southwestern Virginia at {{coord|36|36|N|82|11|W|type:city}} (36.6111, -82.1762).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the west, north, and east by [[Washington County, Virginia]], and to the south by the city of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]] in [[Sullivan County, Tennessee]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|34.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|33.7|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.4|km2|order=flip}}, or 1.07%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US5109816| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Bristol city, Virginia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 20, 2015}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Little Creek and Beaver Creek flow south through the city; Little Creek flows into Beaver Creek two blocks south of the state line in Tennessee.

By 2001, BVU had been granted approval by the city council for a full deployment of a [[Fiber to the premises]] (FTTP or FTTU, fiber to the user) project. This project was to offer competition to local incumbents and provide broadband Internet, cable TV, and telephone service to the residents of Bristol. This deployment was one of the first of its kind in the United States and was widely watched by the telecommunications industry. A system known as [[Passive optical network]] (PON) was successfully deployed to over 6,000 customers in a matter of two years.\n\nIn 2003, in the relatively isolated city of Bristol, Virginia, BVU, created a nonprofit division called \"Optinet\", a municipal broadband Internet service that covers Bristol as well as the Southwest portion of the state of Virginia.

The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines the city of Bristol, Virginia, with neighboring [[Washington County, Virginia]], for statistical purposes. Bristol is a principal city of the [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]]\u2013[[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]]\u2013Bristol, TN-VA [[Kingsport-Bristol-Bristol, TN-VA MSA|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is a component of the [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]\u2013Kingsport\u2013Bristol, TN-VA [[Combined Statistical Area]] \u2013 commonly known as the \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" region. \n\n==History==\n\n[[Evan Shelby]] first appeared in what is now the Bristol area around 1765. In 1766, Shelby moved his family and settled at a place called Big Camp Meet (now Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia). It is said that [[Cherokee Indians]] once inhabited the area and the Indian village was named, according to legend, because numerous deer and buffalo met here to feast in the [[canebrakes]]. Shelby renamed the site Sapling Grove (which would later be changed to Bristol).  In 1774, Shelby erected a fort on a hill overlooking what is now downtown Bristol. It was an important stopping-off place for notables such as Daniel Boone and George Rogers Clark, as well as hundreds of pioneers\u2019 en route to the interior of the developing nation. This fort, known as Shelby's Station was actually a combination trading post, way station, and stockade.<ref name=discover>{{cite web|url=http://discoverbristol.org/history-of-bristol/|title=The History of Bristol|work=Discover Bristol|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, when surveyors projected a junction of two railroad lines at the Virginia-Tennessee state line, Reverend James King conveyed much of his acreage to his son-in-law, Joseph R. Anderson. Anderson laid out the original town of Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia and building began in 1853.<ref name=discover/>\n\nSamuel Goodson, who owned land that adjoined the original town of Bristol TN/VA at its northern boundary (Beaver Creek was the dividing line), started a development known as Goodsonville.  Anderson was unable to incorporate Bristol across the state lines of Tennessee and Virginia.  In 1856, Goodsonville and the original Bristol, Virginia were merged to form the composite town of Goodson, Virginia.<ref name=discover/>\n\nIncorporation for Bristol, Tennessee and Goodson, Virginia occurred in 1856. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroads reached the cities in the late summer of 1856. Due to having two different railroads companies, two depots served the cities; one in Bristol, Tenn. and the other in Goodson, Va. However, the depot located in Goodson continued to be referred to as Bristol, Virginia. In 1890, Goodson, Virginia once again took the name Bristol.<ref name=discover/>\n\n[[The Grove (Bristol, Virginia)|The Grove]], [[Solar Hill Historic District]], and [[Walnut Grove (Bristol, Virginia)|Walnut Grove]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBristol is located in southwestern Virginia at {{coord|36|36|N|82|11|W|type:city}} (36.6111, -82.1762).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the west, north, and east by [[Washington County, Virginia]], and to the south by the city of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]] in [[Sullivan County, Tennessee]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|34.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|33.7|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.4|km2|order=flip}}, or 1.07%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US5109816| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Bristol city, Virginia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 20, 2015}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Little Creek and Beaver Creek flow south through the city; Little Creek flows into Beaver Creek two blocks south of the state line in Tennessee.

By 2001, BVU had been granted approval by the city council for a full deployment of a [[Fiber to the premises]] (FTTP or FTTU, fiber to the user) project. This project was to offer competition to local incumbents and provide broadband Internet, cable TV, and telephone service to the residents of Bristol. This deployment was one of the first of its kind in the United States and was widely watched by the telecommunications industry. A system known as [[Passive optical network]] (PON) was successfully deployed to over 6,000 customers in a matter of two years.\n\nIn 2003, in the relatively isolated city of Bristol, Virginia, BVU, created a nonprofit division called \"Optinet\", a municipal broadband Internet service that covers Bristol as well as the Southwest portion of the state of Virginia.

The scenes utilising [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] (or [[model animation]]), those featuring creatures on the island or Kong, were the work of pioneer model animator [[Willis H. O'Brien|Willis O'Brien]]. His work in ''King Kong'' inspired Harryhausen, and a friend arranged a meeting with O'Brien for him. O'Brien critiqued Harryhausen's early models and urged him to take classes in graphic arts and sculpture to hone his skills. Meanwhile, Harryhausen became friends with an aspiring writer, [[Ray Bradbury]], with similar enthusiasms.<ref>''The Harryhausen Chronicles'', documentary written and directed by Richard Schickel, 1997.</ref> Bradbury and Harryhausen joined the Los Angeles-area [[Science Fiction League]] formed by [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in 1939, and the three became lifelong friends.\n\nHarryhausen secured his first commercial model-animation job, on [[George Pal|George Pal's]] ''[[Puppetoons]]'' shorts, based on viewing his first formal demo reel of fighting dinosaurs from a project called ''Evolution of the World'', which was never finished.<ref>url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ray-harryhausen-pioneer-of-special-effects-hailed-as-the-master-of-stop-motion-animation-8608340.html |title=Ray Harryhausen: Pioneer of special effects hailed as the master of stop-motion animation</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, Harryhausen served in the United States Army [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] Division under Colonel [[Frank Capra]], as a loader, clapper boy, gofer and later camera assistant, whilst working at home animating short films about the use and development of military equipment. During this time, he also worked with composer [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] and Ted Geisel (\"[[Dr. Seuss]]\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/58/58harryhauseniv.html | title=Monsters, Inc.

The filmmakers learned that a long-time friend of Harryhausen, writer [[Ray Bradbury]], had sold a short story called \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (later re-titled \"[[The Fog Horn]]\") to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', about a dinosaur drawn to a lone lighthouse by its foghorn. Because the story for Harryhausen's film featured a similar scene, the film studio bought the rights to Bradbury's story to avoid any potential legal problems. Also, the title was changed back to ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms''. Under that title, it became Harryhausen's first solo feature film effort, and a major international box-office hit for [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]].\n\nIt was on ''The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'' that Harryhausen first used a technique he created called \"[[Dynamation]]\" that split the background and foreground of pre-shot live action footage into two separate images into which he would animate a model or models, seemingly integrating the live-action with the models. The background would be used as a miniature rear-screen with his models animated in front of it, re-photographed with an animation-capable camera to combine those two elements together, the foreground element matted out to leave a black space. Then the film was rewound, and everything except the foreground element matted out so that the foreground element would now photograph in the previously blacked out area. This created the effect that the animated model was \"sandwiched\" in between the two live action elements, right into the final live action scene.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dalton |first1=Tony |last2=Harryhausen |first2=Ray |title=A Century of Stop Motion: From M\u00e9li\u00e8s to Aardman |date=2008 |publisher=Watson Guptill}}</ref>\n\nIn most of Harryhausen's films, model animated characters interact with, and are a part of, the live action world, with the idea that they will cease to call attention to themselves as only \"animation.\" Most of the effects shots in his earliest films were created via Harryhausen's careful frame-by-frame control of the lighting of both the set and the projector. This dramatically reduced much of degradation common in the use of back-projection or the creation of dupe negatives via the use of an [[optical printer]]. Harryhausen's use of diffused glass to soften the sharpness of light on the animated elements allowed the matching of the soft background plates far more successfully than Willis O'Brien had achieved in his early films, allowing Harryhausen to match live and miniature elements seamlessly in most of his shots. By developing and executing most of this miniature work himself, Harryhausen saved money, while maintaining full technical control.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Cyclops vs Dragon.png|thumb|The [[Cyclops]] and [[Dragon]] battle sequence from ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958).]]\n\nA few years later, when Harryhausen began working with color film to make ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', he experimented extensively with color film stocks to overcome the color-balance-shift problems.

Schneer]] coined the word Dynamation as a \"merchandising term\" (modifying it to \"SuperDynaMation\" and then \"Dynarama\" for some subsequent films).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayharryhausen.com/dynamation.php |title=Dynamation |work=Ray Harryhausen: the official website |publisher=Rayharryhausen.com |year=2009 |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223005306/http://www.rayharryhausen.com/dynamation.php |archivedate=2012-02-23 }}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen was always heavily involved in the pre-production conceptualizing of each film's story, script development, art-direction, design, storyboards, and general tone of his films, as much as any ''[[Auteur theory|auteur]]'' director would have on any other film, which any \"director\" of Harryhausen's films had to understand and agree to work under. The complexities of the [[Directors Guild of America]]'s rules prevented Harryhausen from being credited as the director of his films, resulting in the more modest credits he had in most of his films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThroughout most of his career, Harryhausen's work was a sort of family affair. His father did the machining of the metal armatures (based on his son's designs) that were the skeletons for the models and allowed them to keep their position, while his mother assisted with some miniature costumes. After Harryhausen's father died in 1973, Harryhausen contracted his armature work out to another machinist. An occasional assistant, [[George Lofgren]], a taxidermist, assisted Harryhausen with the creation of furred creatures. Another associate, [[Willis Cook]], built some of Harryhausen's miniature sets. Other than that, Harryhausen worked generally alone to produce almost all of the animation for his films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe same year that ''Beast'' was released, 1953, fledgling film producer [[Irwin Allen]] released a live action documentary about life in the oceans titled ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', which won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best documentary feature film of that year. Allen's and Harryhausen's paths would cross three years later, on Allen's sequel to this film.\n\nHarryhausen soon met and began a fruitful partnership with producer [[Charles H. Schneer]], who was working with the [[Sam Katzman]] B-picture unit of [[Columbia Pictures]]. Their first tandem project was ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (a.k.a. ''Monster from Beneath the Sea'', 1955), about a giant octopus attacking San Francisco. It was a box-office success, quickly followed by ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956), set in Washington D.C. \u2013 one of the best of the alien invasion films of the 1950s, and also a box office hit.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1954, Irwin Allen had started work on a second feature-length documentary film, this one about animal life on land called ''[[The Animal World (film)|The Animal World]]'' (completed in 1956). Needing an opening sequence about dinosaurs, Allen hired premier model animator Willis O'Brien to animate the dinosaurs, but then gave him an impossibly short production schedule. O'Brien again hired Harryhausen to help with animation to complete the eight-minute sequence. It was Harryhausen's and O'Brien's first and only professional full-color work. Most viewers agree that the dinosaur sequence of ''Animal World'' was the best part of the entire movie{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} (''Animal World'' is available on the DVD release of O'Brien's 1957 film ''[[The Black Scorpion (film)|The Black Scorpion]]'').\n\nHarryhausen then returned to Columbia and Charles Schneer to make ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' (1957), about an American spaceship returning from Venus. The spaceship crashes into the sea near [[Sicily]], releasing an on-board alien egg specimen which washes up on shore. The egg soon hatches a creature that, in Earth's atmosphere, rapidly grows to gigantic size and terrifies the citizens of Rome. Harryhausen refined and improved his already-considerable ability at establishing emotional characterizations in the face of his Venusian ''Ymir'' model, creating yet another international box office hit.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSchneer was eager to graduate to full-color films. Reluctant at first, Harryhausen managed to develop the systems necessary to maintain proper color balances for his DynaMation process, resulting in his biggest hit of the 1950s, ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958). The top-grossing film of that summer, and one of the top-grossing films of that year, Schneer and Harryhausen signed another deal with Columbia for four more color films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Jason and the Argonauts (1963) Hydra fight.png|thumb|right|The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] battle sequence in ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963).]]\nAfter ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'' (1960) and ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1961), both great artistic and technical successes, and successful at the box office, according to Harryhausen, who stated in the DVD and Blu-ray featurette about the making of ''Mysterious Island'': \"''Mysterious Island'' was one of the most successful films that we made and I am glad people are still enjoying it today\". And ''Gulliver'' \" made its' profits\"{{Verify quote|date=April 2018}} as Ray is quoted in [[Jeff Rovin]]'s bio-book ''From The Land Beyond Beyond: The Making of the Movie Monsters You've Known and Loved - The Films of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen''.  His next film is considered by film historians{{who|date=April 2018}} and fans as Harryhausen's masterwork, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). Among the film's several celebrated animation sequences is an extended fight between three actors and seven living skeletons, a considerable advance on the single-skeleton fight scene in ''Sinbad''. This stop-motion sequence took over four months to complete.\n[[File:Harryhausen Allosaurus Talos NMM.jpg|thumb|left|Models for the Allosaur in ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966) and Talos from ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963) at the [[National Media Museum]].]]\nHarryhausen next made ''[[First Men in the Moon (1964 film)|First Men in the Moon]]'' (1964), his only film made in the 2.35:1 [[widescreen]] (a.k.a. \"[[CinemaScope]]\") format, based on the novel by [[H. G. Wells]]. ''Jason'' and ''First Men in the Moon'' were box office disappointments at the time of their original theatrical release. That, plus changes of management at Columbia Pictures, resulted in his contract with Columbia Picture not being renewed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Also, as the 1960s counter-culture came to influence more and more and younger filmmakers, and failing studios struggled to find material that was popular with the new \"[[Baby boomer|Boomer-generation]]\" audience, Harryhausen's love of the past, setting his stories in ancient fantasy worlds or previous centuries, kept him from keeping pace with changing tastes in the 1960s. Only a handful of Harryhausen's features have been set in then-present time, and none in the future. As this revolution in the traditional Hollywood movie studio system, and the influx of a new generation of film makers sorted itself out, Harryhausen became a free agent.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nHarryhausen was then hired by [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] to animate the dinosaurs for ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966).  It was a success at the box office, helped in part by the presence of [[Raquel Welch]] in her second film. Harryhausen next went on to make another dinosaur film, ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' with Schneer. The project had been developed for Columbia, who declined. Schneer then made a deal with [[Warner Brothers]] instead. It was a personal project to Harryhausen, which he had wanted to do for many years, as it was storyboarded by his original mentor, Willis O'Brien for a 1939 film, ''Gwangi'', that was never completed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Set in Mexico, ''The Valley of Gwangi'' is a parallel ''Kong'' story\u2014cowboys capture a living ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and bring him to the nearest Mexican town for exhibition. Sabotage releases the creature, and it wreaks havoc on the town. The film features a roping scene reminiscent of 1949's ''Mighty Joe Young'' (which was itself recycled from the old ''Gwangi'' storyboards), and a spectacular fire and animation sequence inside a cathedral toward the end of the film.\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nAfter a few lean years, Harryhausen and Schneer talked Columbia Pictures into reviving the Sinbad character, resulting in ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'', often remembered for the sword fight involving a statue of the six-armed Hindu goddess Kali. It was first released in Los Angeles in the Christmas season of 1973, but garnered its main audience in the spring and summer of 1974. It was followed by ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977), which disappointed some fans because of its tongue-in-cheek approach. Both films were, however, box office successes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSchneer and Harryhausen finally were allowed by [[MGM]] to produce a big budget film with name actors and an expanded effects budget. The film started out smaller, but then MGM increased the budget to hire stars such as [[Laurence Olivier]]. It became the last feature film to showcase his effects work, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981), for which he was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Special Effects. For this film, he hired prot\u00e9g\u00e9 model animators Steve Archer and two-time Oscar-nominated [[Jim Danforth]] to assist with major animation sequences. Harryhausen fans will readily discern that the armed-and-finned Kraken (a name borrowed from medieval Scandinavian folklore) he invented for ''Clash of the Titans'' has similar facial qualities to the Venusian Ymir he created 25 years earlier for ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''.\n\nPerhaps because of his hermetic production style and the fact that he produced half of his films outside of Hollywood (living in London since 1960), reducing his day-to-day kinship with other more traditional, but still influential Hollywood effects artists, none of Harryhausen's films were nominated for a special effects Oscar. Harryhausen himself says the reason was that he worked in Europe, but this oversight by the AMPAS visual-effects committee also occurred throughout the 1950s when Harryhausen lived in Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn spite of the very successful box office returns of ''Clash of the Titans'', more sophisticated computer-assisted technology developed by ILM and others began to eclipse Harryhausen's production techniques, and so MGM and other studios passed on funding his planned sequel, ''Force of the Trojans'', causing Harryhausen and Schneer to retire from active filmmaking.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, Harryhausen had also concentrated his efforts on authoring a book, ''Film Fantasy Scrapbook'' (produced in three editions as his last three films were released) and supervising the restoration and release of (eventually all) his films to VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and currently Blu-ray. A second book followed, ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life'', written with author and friend [[Tony Dalton]], which details his techniques and history.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview16 \"Model Heroes: ...

In 2011, Harryhausen and Dalton's last volume, called ''Ray Harryhausen's Fantasy Scrapbook'', was also published.\n\nHarryhausen continued his lifelong friendship with [[Ray Bradbury]] until Bradbury's death in 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Another long-time close friend was ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine editor, book writer, and sci-fi collector [[Forrest J Ackerman]], who loaned Harryhausen his photos of ''King Kong'' in 1933, right after Harryhausen had seen the film for the first time.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Harryhausen also maintained his friendships with his long-time producer, [[Charles H. Schneer]], who lived next door to him in a suburb of London until Schneer moved full-time to the U.S. (a few years later, in early 2009, Schneer died at 88 in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]);<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/movies/27schneer.html \"Charles H.

He also appears as a bar patron in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'', and as a doctor in the John Landis film ''[[Spies Like Us]]''. In 2010, Harryhausen had a brief cameo in ''[[Burke & Hare (2010 film)|Burke & Hare]]'', a British film also directed by Landis.\n\nIn 1986, Harryhausen formed the Ray & Diana Harryhausen Foundation, a registered charity in the U.K. and U.S., which preserves all of his collection and promotes the art of stop-motion animation and Harryhausen's contributions to the genre.\n\n===2000s\u20132010s===\nIn 2002, young animators Seamus Walsh and Mark Caballero helped Harryhausen complete ''The Story of the Tortoise and the Hare''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This was the sixth and final installment of the Harryhausen fairy tales.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The film was started in 1952 and completed in 2002, 50 years later.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Caballero and Walsh refurbished the original puppets and, under Harryhausen's direction and guidance, completed the film.

His last film was ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981), after which he retired.\n\nHarryhausen moved to the United Kingdom, became a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen and lived in London from 1960 until his death in 2013. During his life, his innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers.

(n\u00e9e Reske) and Frederick W. Harryhausen. Of [[German people|German]] descent, the family surname was originally spelled \"Herrenhausen\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mandell, Paul |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1254069131/of-genies-and-dragons-the-career-of-ray-harryhausen |title=Of Genies and Dragons: The Career of Ray Harryhausen|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=73|issue=12|date=December 1992 |publisher=via Questia.com |accessdate=2013-05-10}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1930s and 1940s===\nAfter having seen ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) on its initial release for the first of many times, Harryhausen spent his early years experimenting in the production of animated shorts, inspired by the burgeoning science fiction literary genre of the period. The scenes utilising [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] (or [[model animation]]), those featuring creatures on the island or Kong, were the work of pioneer model animator [[Willis H. O'Brien|Willis O'Brien]]. His work in ''King Kong'' inspired Harryhausen, and a friend arranged a meeting with O'Brien for him. O'Brien critiqued Harryhausen's early models and urged him to take classes in graphic arts and sculpture to hone his skills. Meanwhile, Harryhausen became friends with an aspiring writer, [[Ray Bradbury]], with similar enthusiasms.<ref>''The Harryhausen Chronicles'', documentary written and directed by Richard Schickel, 1997.</ref> Bradbury and Harryhausen joined the Los Angeles-area [[Science Fiction League]] formed by [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in 1939, and the three became lifelong friends.\n\nHarryhausen secured his first commercial model-animation job, on [[George Pal|George Pal's]] ''[[Puppetoons]]'' shorts, based on viewing his first formal demo reel of fighting dinosaurs from a project called ''Evolution of the World'', which was never finished.<ref>url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ray-harryhausen-pioneer-of-special-effects-hailed-as-the-master-of-stop-motion-animation-8608340.html |title=Ray Harryhausen: Pioneer of special effects hailed as the master of stop-motion animation</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, Harryhausen served in the United States Army [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] Division under Colonel [[Frank Capra]], as a loader, clapper boy, gofer and later camera assistant, whilst working at home animating short films about the use and development of military equipment. During this time, he also worked with composer [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] and Ted Geisel (\"[[Dr. Seuss]]\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/58/58harryhauseniv.html | title=Monsters, Inc.

The filmmakers learned that a long-time friend of Harryhausen, writer [[Ray Bradbury]], had sold a short story called \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (later re-titled \"[[The Fog Horn]]\") to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', about a dinosaur drawn to a lone lighthouse by its foghorn. Because the story for Harryhausen's film featured a similar scene, the film studio bought the rights to Bradbury's story to avoid any potential legal problems. Also, the title was changed back to ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms''. Under that title, it became Harryhausen's first solo feature film effort, and a major international box-office hit for [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]].\n\nIt was on ''The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'' that Harryhausen first used a technique he created called \"[[Dynamation]]\" that split the background and foreground of pre-shot live action footage into two separate images into which he would animate a model or models, seemingly integrating the live-action with the models. The background would be used as a miniature rear-screen with his models animated in front of it, re-photographed with an animation-capable camera to combine those two elements together, the foreground element matted out to leave a black space. Then the film was rewound, and everything except the foreground element matted out so that the foreground element would now photograph in the previously blacked out area. This created the effect that the animated model was \"sandwiched\" in between the two live action elements, right into the final live action scene.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dalton |first1=Tony |last2=Harryhausen |first2=Ray |title=A Century of Stop Motion: From M\u00e9li\u00e8s to Aardman |date=2008 |publisher=Watson Guptill}}</ref>\n\nIn most of Harryhausen's films, model animated characters interact with, and are a part of, the live action world, with the idea that they will cease to call attention to themselves as only \"animation.\" Most of the effects shots in his earliest films were created via Harryhausen's careful frame-by-frame control of the lighting of both the set and the projector. This dramatically reduced much of degradation common in the use of back-projection or the creation of dupe negatives via the use of an [[optical printer]]. Harryhausen's use of diffused glass to soften the sharpness of light on the animated elements allowed the matching of the soft background plates far more successfully than Willis O'Brien had achieved in his early films, allowing Harryhausen to match live and miniature elements seamlessly in most of his shots. By developing and executing most of this miniature work himself, Harryhausen saved money, while maintaining full technical control.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Cyclops vs Dragon.png|thumb|The [[Cyclops]] and [[Dragon]] battle sequence from ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958).]]\n\nA few years later, when Harryhausen began working with color film to make ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', he experimented extensively with color film stocks to overcome the color-balance-shift problems. Ray's producer/partner [[Charles H. Schneer]] coined the word Dynamation as a \"merchandising term\" (modifying it to \"SuperDynaMation\" and then \"Dynarama\" for some subsequent films).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayharryhausen.com/dynamation.php |title=Dynamation |work=Ray Harryhausen: the official website |publisher=Rayharryhausen.com |year=2009 |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223005306/http://www.rayharryhausen.com/dynamation.php |archivedate=2012-02-23 }}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen was always heavily involved in the pre-production conceptualizing of each film's story, script development, art-direction, design, storyboards, and general tone of his films, as much as any ''[[Auteur theory|auteur]]'' director would have on any other film, which any \"director\" of Harryhausen's films had to understand and agree to work under. The complexities of the [[Directors Guild of America]]'s rules prevented Harryhausen from being credited as the director of his films, resulting in the more modest credits he had in most of his films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThroughout most of his career, Harryhausen's work was a sort of family affair. His father did the machining of the metal armatures (based on his son's designs) that were the skeletons for the models and allowed them to keep their position, while his mother assisted with some miniature costumes. After Harryhausen's father died in 1973, Harryhausen contracted his armature work out to another machinist. An occasional assistant, [[George Lofgren]], a taxidermist, assisted Harryhausen with the creation of furred creatures. Another associate, [[Willis Cook]], built some of Harryhausen's miniature sets. Other than that, Harryhausen worked generally alone to produce almost all of the animation for his films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe same year that ''Beast'' was released, 1953, fledgling film producer [[Irwin Allen]] released a live action documentary about life in the oceans titled ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', which won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best documentary feature film of that year. Allen's and Harryhausen's paths would cross three years later, on Allen's sequel to this film.\n\nHarryhausen soon met and began a fruitful partnership with producer [[Charles H. Schneer]], who was working with the [[Sam Katzman]] B-picture unit of [[Columbia Pictures]]. Their first tandem project was ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (a.k.a. ''Monster from Beneath the Sea'', 1955), about a giant octopus attacking San Francisco. It was a box-office success, quickly followed by ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956), set in Washington D.C. \u2013 one of the best of the alien invasion films of the 1950s, and also a box office hit.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1954, Irwin Allen had started work on a second feature-length documentary film, this one about animal life on land called ''[[The Animal World (film)|The Animal World]]'' (completed in 1956). Needing an opening sequence about dinosaurs, Allen hired premier model animator Willis O'Brien to animate the dinosaurs, but then gave him an impossibly short production schedule. O'Brien again hired Harryhausen to help with animation to complete the eight-minute sequence. It was Harryhausen's and O'Brien's first and only professional full-color work. Most viewers agree that the dinosaur sequence of ''Animal World'' was the best part of the entire movie{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} (''Animal World'' is available on the DVD release of O'Brien's 1957 film ''[[The Black Scorpion (film)|The Black Scorpion]]'').\n\nHarryhausen then returned to Columbia and Charles Schneer to make ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' (1957), about an American spaceship returning from Venus. The spaceship crashes into the sea near [[Sicily]], releasing an on-board alien egg specimen which washes up on shore. The egg soon hatches a creature that, in Earth's atmosphere, rapidly grows to gigantic size and terrifies the citizens of Rome. Harryhausen refined and improved his already-considerable ability at establishing emotional characterizations in the face of his Venusian ''Ymir'' model, creating yet another international box office hit.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSchneer was eager to graduate to full-color films. Reluctant at first, Harryhausen managed to develop the systems necessary to maintain proper color balances for his DynaMation process, resulting in his biggest hit of the 1950s, ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958). The top-grossing film of that summer, and one of the top-grossing films of that year, Schneer and Harryhausen signed another deal with Columbia for four more color films.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Jason and the Argonauts (1963) Hydra fight.png|thumb|right|The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] battle sequence in ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963).]]\nAfter ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'' (1960) and ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1961), both great artistic and technical successes, and successful at the box office, according to Harryhausen, who stated in the DVD and Blu-ray featurette about the making of ''Mysterious Island'': \"''Mysterious Island'' was one of the most successful films that we made and I am glad people are still enjoying it today\". And ''Gulliver'' \" made its' profits\"{{Verify quote|date=April 2018}} as Ray is quoted in [[Jeff Rovin]]'s bio-book ''From The Land Beyond Beyond: The Making of the Movie Monsters You've Known and Loved - The Films of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen''.  His next film is considered by film historians{{who|date=April 2018}} and fans as Harryhausen's masterwork, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). Among the film's several celebrated animation sequences is an extended fight between three actors and seven living skeletons, a considerable advance on the single-skeleton fight scene in ''Sinbad''. This stop-motion sequence took over four months to complete.\n[[File:Harryhausen Allosaurus Talos NMM.jpg|thumb|left|Models for the Allosaur in ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966) and Talos from ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963) at the [[National Media Museum]].]]\nHarryhausen next made ''[[First Men in the Moon (1964 film)|First Men in the Moon]]'' (1964), his only film made in the 2.35:1 [[widescreen]] (a.k.a. \"[[CinemaScope]]\") format, based on the novel by [[H. G. Wells]]. ''Jason'' and ''First Men in the Moon'' were box office disappointments at the time of their original theatrical release. That, plus changes of management at Columbia Pictures, resulted in his contract with Columbia Picture not being renewed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Also, as the 1960s counter-culture came to influence more and more and younger filmmakers, and failing studios struggled to find material that was popular with the new \"[[Baby boomer|Boomer-generation]]\" audience, Harryhausen's love of the past, setting his stories in ancient fantasy worlds or previous centuries, kept him from keeping pace with changing tastes in the 1960s. Only a handful of Harryhausen's features have been set in then-present time, and none in the future. As this revolution in the traditional Hollywood movie studio system, and the influx of a new generation of film makers sorted itself out, Harryhausen became a free agent.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nHarryhausen was then hired by [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] to animate the dinosaurs for ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966).  It was a success at the box office, helped in part by the presence of [[Raquel Welch]] in her second film. Harryhausen next went on to make another dinosaur film, ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' with Schneer. The project had been developed for Columbia, who declined. Schneer then made a deal with [[Warner Brothers]] instead. It was a personal project to Harryhausen, which he had wanted to do for many years, as it was storyboarded by his original mentor, Willis O'Brien for a 1939 film, ''Gwangi'', that was never completed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Set in Mexico, ''The Valley of Gwangi'' is a parallel ''Kong'' story\u2014cowboys capture a living ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and bring him to the nearest Mexican town for exhibition. Sabotage releases the creature, and it wreaks havoc on the town. The film features a roping scene reminiscent of 1949's ''Mighty Joe Young'' (which was itself recycled from the old ''Gwangi'' storyboards), and a spectacular fire and animation sequence inside a cathedral toward the end of the film.\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nAfter a few lean years, Harryhausen and Schneer talked Columbia Pictures into reviving the Sinbad character, resulting in ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'', often remembered for the sword fight involving a statue of the six-armed Hindu goddess Kali. It was first released in Los Angeles in the Christmas season of 1973, but garnered its main audience in the spring and summer of 1974. It was followed by ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977), which disappointed some fans because of its tongue-in-cheek approach. Both films were, however, box office successes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSchneer and Harryhausen finally were allowed by [[MGM]] to produce a big budget film with name actors and an expanded effects budget. The film started out smaller, but then MGM increased the budget to hire stars such as [[Laurence Olivier]]. It became the last feature film to showcase his effects work, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981), for which he was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Special Effects. For this film, he hired prot\u00e9g\u00e9 model animators Steve Archer and two-time Oscar-nominated [[Jim Danforth]] to assist with major animation sequences. Harryhausen fans will readily discern that the armed-and-finned Kraken (a name borrowed from medieval Scandinavian folklore) he invented for ''Clash of the Titans'' has similar facial qualities to the Venusian Ymir he created 25 years earlier for ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''.\n\nPerhaps because of his hermetic production style and the fact that he produced half of his films outside of Hollywood (living in London since 1960), reducing his day-to-day kinship with other more traditional, but still influential Hollywood effects artists, none of Harryhausen's films were nominated for a special effects Oscar.

These are common in [[Scotland]]. In the medieval [[Old Town, Edinburgh]], tenements were developed with each apartment treated as a separate house, built on top of each other (such as [[Gladstone's Land]]). Over hundreds of years, custom grew to become law concerning maintenance and repairs, as first formally discussed in [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Stair]]'s 1681 writings on [[Scots property law]].<ref name=\"ReidZimmermann2000\">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth G.

Tenements with one or two room flats provided popular rented accommodation for workers, but in some inner-city areas, overcrowding and maintenance problems led to [[slum]]s, which have been cleared and redeveloped. In more affluent areas, tenement flats form spacious privately owned houses, some with up to six bedrooms, which continue to be desirable properties.<ref name=\"Hyndland 2018\" />\n\n[[File:Yard_of_a_tenement_at_Park_Ave._LOC_det.4a28182.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tenements at [[Park Avenue]] and 107th Street, [[New York City]], circa 1898\u20131910]]\nIn the United States, the term ''tenement'' initially meant a large building with multiple small spaces to rent. As cities grew in the nineteenth century, there was increasing separation between rich and poor.

The New York State legislature defined it in the Tenement House Act of 1867 in terms of rental occupancy by multiple households, as\n\n{{quote|Any house, building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased, let, or hired out to be occupied or is occupied, as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another and doing their own cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon a floor, so living and cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them.<ref>Quoted in Plunz, p. 167.</ref>|}}\n\nIn Scotland, it continues to be the most common word for a [[Apartment#Scotland|multiple-occupancy building]], but elsewhere it is used as a pejorative in contrast to ''[[apartment|apartment building]]'' or ''block of flats''.<ref>For example, Heller, Vivian.

Glasgow tenements were built to provide high-density housing for the large number of people immigrating to the city in the 19th and early 20th century as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]], when the city's population boomed to more than 1&nbsp;million people. Edinburgh's tenements are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ|title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824, including an account of the great fire of November, 1824 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Smith |year=1824 |last=Chambers |first=Robert |oclc=54265692 |page=11}}</ref> Glasgow tenements were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3&ndash;5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow tenements were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive.\n\nIn Edinburgh, residential dwellings in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]] of the [[medieval]] [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[Georgian era|Georgian]] [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (as well as the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] city centre districts immediately surrounding them) are almost exclusively tenements.\nThe [[Tenement House (Glasgow)|Tenement House]] [[historic house museum]] in the [[Garnethill]] area of Glasgow preserves the interior, fittings and equipment of an  ordinary middle-class tenement from the late 19th century.  \n\nA large number of the tenements in Glasgow were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s because of slum conditions, overcrowding and poor maintenance of the buildings. Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the [[Gorbals]] district, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, which in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is a relatively small area and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions; now the population is roughly 10,000.\n\nTenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible. Largely, such clearances were limited to pre-Victorian buildings outwith the New Town area and were precipitated by the so-called \"Penny Tenement\" incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/entertainment/the-penny-tenement-collapse-that-changed-edinburgh-forever-1-4386368|title=The 'Penny Tenement' collapse that changed Edinburgh forever|website=scotsman.com}}</ref>\n\nApartments in tenement buildings in both cities are now highly sought after, due to their locations and often large rooms, high ceilings, ornamentation and period features.\n\n===Berlin===\n[[File:Meyers Hof.jpg|thumb|left|Meyers Hof in Berlin, 1910]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-69536-0010, Berlin, Marienstra\u00dfe, Wohnhaus, Altbau.jpg|thumb|Members of a tenants' collective in front of their tenement building in [[East Berlin]] in 1959 (the fa\u00e7ade still pockmarked with [[battle in Berlin|1945 battle damage]])]]\nIn German, the term corresponding to ''tenement'' is ''Mietskaserne'', \"rental barracks\", and the city especially known for them is Berlin.

The passages and stairs are common and the rooms all open directly either off the passages or landings.\n\nMost of these houses have yards at the back, some of which are a fair size, while others are very small, and some few houses have no yards at all. Generally, the only water supply of the house is furnished by a single water tap, which is in the yard. The yard is common and the closet accommodation [''toilet''] is to be found there, except in some few cases in which there is no yard, when it is to be found in the basement where there is little light or ventilation.\n\nThe closet accommodation is common not only to the occupants of the house, but to anyone who likes to come in off the street, and is, of course, common to both sexes.

A frequent practice is for the kitchen to also serve as a bedroom for a newly married couple in order to give them some degree of privacy.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:Square Wroc\u0142aw 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Kamienice'' in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] Old Town, [[Market Square, Wroc\u0142aw|Market Square]]]]\n[[File:Warszawa -Star\u00f3wka - Rynek - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Tenements in Warsaw Old Town, Market Square]]\n'''''Kamienica''''' (plural ''kamienice'') is a [[Polish language|Polish]] term describing a type of residential tenement building made of brick or [[Masonry|stone]], with at least two floors. There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until ca. 1800 (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street [[frontage]], in the manner of a [[terraced house]]. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments. Kamienice have windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together.  The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centres of historical cities such as [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], and [[Toru\u0144]], whereas the second type is most prominent in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The name derives from the Polish word ''kamie\u0144'' (stone) and dates from the 15th century.<ref>Maria Bogdani-Czepita and Zbigniew Zuziak, ''Managing Historic Cities'', Krak\u00f3w: International Cultural Centre, 1993, {{ISBN|9788385739074}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuGAAAAIAAJ&q=building+called+kamienica&dq=building+called+kamienica p.&nbsp;194] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514170145/https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuGAAAAIAAJ&q=building+called+kamienica&dq=building+called+kamienica |date=2018-05-14 }}.</ref><ref>Tomasz Torbus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq1NW-9-3dsC&pg=PA164&dq=building+called+kamienica&sig=ACfU3U0ev4KtUsNWFS0mFtkmEVzTRcM0Jw ''Poland''], Nelles guides, Munich: Nelles, 2001, {{ISBN|9783886180882}}.</ref>\n\nNotable examples include:\n* [[Korniakt Palace|Royal Kamienica]] in Lwow, now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]\n* [[Black Kamienica]], also in Lviv\n* [[:pl:Kamienica pod Gutenbergiem|Kamienica pod Gutenbergiem]] on [[Piotrkowska Street]] in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]\n* [[:pl:Kamienica Pod Gwiazd\u0105|Star Kamienica]] in [[Toru\u0144]]\n\n==See also==\n* {{portal-inline|Housing}}\n* [[Corti\u00e7o]], tenements in Portuguese-speaking countries\n* [[Urban decay]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Bauman, John F. \"Introduction: The Eternal War on the Slums,\" ''From Tenements to the Taylor Homes: In Search of an Urban Housing Policy in Twentieth-Century America'', ed.

These are common in [[Scotland]]. In the medieval [[Old Town, Edinburgh]], tenements were developed with each apartment treated as a separate house, built on top of each other (such as [[Gladstone's Land]]). Over hundreds of years, custom grew to become law concerning maintenance and repairs, as first formally discussed in [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Stair]]'s 1681 writings on [[Scots property law]].<ref name=\"ReidZimmermann2000\">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth G.

Tenements with one or two room flats provided popular rented accommodation for workers, but in some inner-city areas, overcrowding and maintenance problems led to [[slum]]s, which have been cleared and redeveloped. In more affluent areas, tenement flats form spacious privately owned houses, some with up to six bedrooms, which continue to be desirable properties.<ref name=\"Hyndland 2018\" />\n\n[[File:Yard_of_a_tenement_at_Park_Ave._LOC_det.4a28182.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tenements at [[Park Avenue]] and 107th Street, [[New York City]], circa 1898\u20131910]]\nIn the United States, the term ''tenement'' initially meant a large building with multiple small spaces to rent.

The New York State legislature defined it in the Tenement House Act of 1867 in terms of rental occupancy by multiple households, as\n\n{{quote|Any house, building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased, let, or hired out to be occupied or is occupied, as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another and doing their own cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon a floor, so living and cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them.<ref>Quoted in Plunz, p. 167.</ref>|}}\n\nIn Scotland, it continues to be the most common word for a [[Apartment#Scotland|multiple-occupancy building]], but elsewhere it is used as a pejorative in contrast to ''[[apartment|apartment building]]'' or ''block of flats''.<ref>For example, Heller, Vivian.

Edinburgh's tenements are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ|title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824, including an account of the great fire of November, 1824 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Smith |year=1824 |last=Chambers |first=Robert |oclc=54265692 |page=11}}</ref> Glasgow tenements were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3&ndash;5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow tenements were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive.\n\nIn Edinburgh, residential dwellings in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]] of the [[medieval]] [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[Georgian era|Georgian]] [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (as well as the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] city centre districts immediately surrounding them) are almost exclusively tenements.\nThe [[Tenement House (Glasgow)|Tenement House]] [[historic house museum]] in the [[Garnethill]] area of Glasgow preserves the interior, fittings and equipment of an  ordinary middle-class tenement from the late 19th century.  \n\nA large number of the tenements in Glasgow were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s because of slum conditions, overcrowding and poor maintenance of the buildings. Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the [[Gorbals]] district, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, which in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is a relatively small area and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions; now the population is roughly 10,000.\n\nTenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible. Largely, such clearances were limited to pre-Victorian buildings outwith the New Town area and were precipitated by the so-called \"Penny Tenement\" incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/entertainment/the-penny-tenement-collapse-that-changed-edinburgh-forever-1-4386368|title=The 'Penny Tenement' collapse that changed Edinburgh forever|website=scotsman.com}}</ref>\n\nApartments in tenement buildings in both cities are now highly sought after, due to their locations and often large rooms, high ceilings, ornamentation and period features.\n\n===Berlin===\n[[File:Meyers Hof.jpg|thumb|left|Meyers Hof in Berlin, 1910]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-69536-0010, Berlin, Marienstra\u00dfe, Wohnhaus, Altbau.jpg|thumb|Members of a tenants' collective in front of their tenement building in [[East Berlin]] in 1959 (the fa\u00e7ade still pockmarked with [[battle in Berlin|1945 battle damage]])]]\nIn German, the term corresponding to ''tenement'' is ''Mietskaserne'', \"rental barracks\", and the city especially known for them is Berlin.

We have visited one house that we found to be occupied by 98 persons, another by 74 and a third by 73.\n\nThe entrance to all tenement houses is by a common door off either a street, lane or alley, and, in most cases, the door is never shut, day or night. The passages and stairs are common and the rooms all open directly either off the passages or landings.\n\nMost of these houses have yards at the back, some of which are a fair size, while others are very small, and some few houses have no yards at all. Generally, the only water supply of the house is furnished by a single water tap, which is in the yard. The yard is common and the closet accommodation [''toilet''] is to be found there, except in some few cases in which there is no yard, when it is to be found in the basement where there is little light or ventilation.\n\nThe closet accommodation is common not only to the occupants of the house, but to anyone who likes to come in off the street, and is, of course, common to both sexes. The roofs of the tenement houses are, as a rule, bad . . .\n\nHaving visited a large number of these houses in all parts of the city, we have no hesitation in saying that it is no uncommon thing to find halls and landings, yards and closets of the houses in a filthy condition, and, in nearly every case, human excreta is to be found scattered about the yards and in the floors of the closets and, in some cases, even in the passages of the house itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/life-in-the-tenements-was-hard-and-brutal-29780548.html|title=Life in the tenements was hard and brutal|website=independent}}</ref>}}\n\nTenement life often appeared in fiction, such as the \"Dublin trilogy\" of plays by [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]'s play ''[[Blight (play)|Blight]]'', and [[James Plunkett]]'s novel ''[[Strumpet City]]'' ([[Strumpet City (miniseries)|adapted for television]] in 1980).

These were long and narrow, three to six times as long as they were wide, and the size of the patios was reduced until as many as 350 people could be living on a lot that had originally housed 25. Purpose-built tenements copied their form. By 1907 there were some 2,500 conventillos, with 150,000 occupants.<ref>Girouard, p. 338.</ref> El conventillo de la Paloma was particularly famous and is the title of a play by [[Alberto Vaccarezza]].\n\n===Mumbai===\n[[File:Chawl - Mumbai 2006.jpg|thumb|A ''[[chawl]]'' in [[Mumbai]]]]\n{{main|Chawl}}\n\"Chawls\" are found in [[India]].

Many chawl buildings can be found in [[Mumbai]], where chawls were constructed by the thousands to house people migrating to the large city because of its booming cotton mills and overall strong economy.\n\nA typical chawl tenement consists of one all-purpose room, which functions both as a living and sleeping space, and a kitchen which also serves as a dining room. A frequent practice is for the kitchen to also serve as a bedroom for a newly married couple in order to give them some degree of privacy.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:Square Wroc\u0142aw 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Kamienice'' in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] Old Town, [[Market Square, Wroc\u0142aw|Market Square]]]]\n[[File:Warszawa -Star\u00f3wka - Rynek - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Tenements in Warsaw Old Town, Market Square]]\n'''''Kamienica''''' (plural ''kamienice'') is a [[Polish language|Polish]] term describing a type of residential tenement building made of brick or [[Masonry|stone]], with at least two floors. There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until ca. 1800 (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street [[frontage]], in the manner of a [[terraced house]]. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments. Kamienice have windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together.  The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centres of historical cities such as [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], and [[Toru\u0144]], whereas the second type is most prominent in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The name derives from the Polish word ''kamie\u0144'' (stone) and dates from the 15th century.<ref>Maria Bogdani-Czepita and Zbigniew Zuziak, ''Managing Historic Cities'', Krak\u00f3w: International Cultural Centre, 1993, {{ISBN|9788385739074}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuGAAAAIAAJ&q=building+called+kamienica&dq=building+called+kamienica p.&nbsp;194] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514170145/https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuGAAAAIAAJ&q=building+called+kamienica&dq=building+called+kamienica |date=2018-05-14 }}.</ref><ref>Tomasz Torbus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq1NW-9-3dsC&pg=PA164&dq=building+called+kamienica&sig=ACfU3U0ev4KtUsNWFS0mFtkmEVzTRcM0Jw ''Poland''], Nelles guides, Munich: Nelles, 2001, {{ISBN|9783886180882}}.</ref>\n\nNotable examples include:\n* [[Korniakt Palace|Royal Kamienica]] in Lwow, now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]\n* [[Black Kamienica]], also in Lviv\n* [[:pl:Kamienica pod Gutenbergiem|Kamienica pod Gutenbergiem]] on [[Piotrkowska Street]] in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]\n* [[:pl:Kamienica Pod Gwiazd\u0105|Star Kamienica]] in [[Toru\u0144]]\n\n==See also==\n* {{portal-inline|Housing}}\n* [[Corti\u00e7o]], tenements in Portuguese-speaking countries\n* [[Urban decay]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Bauman, John F. \"Introduction: The Eternal War on the Slums,\" ''From Tenements to the Taylor Homes: In Search of an Urban Housing Policy in Twentieth-Century America'', ed.

Meanwhile, two bank robbers are escorting two hostages, Sylvia and her child back from a local diner to her home. A busboy from the diner returns a toy the child left behind, notices the two men, and engages them diffusing the situation by killing one of the men and chasing away the other. Before Sylvia can dial 911 the busboy disappears. Danny finds Steve at John's, Steve's fathers, grave. Steve reveals to Danny that the letter Doris left is only a [[cipher]], confiding in Danny how much things have changed in the ten-years since his father died, that he doesn't plan on solving the cipher because he doesn't need another mystery in his life.\n\nFive-0 begins looking for the two men along with the mysterious busboy who is found to be living under an assumed identity of a person who's been dead for three years. Adam searches the busboy's hotel room and finds DNA which matches to Lincoln Cole, a former marine who went [[Desertion#United States|AWOL]]. McGarrett and Junior go to see Lee Phillips, a former [[Commanding Officer]] of Cole's. They find Cole and take him into custody. The brother of the man Cole killed takes Sylvia and her child hostage again and orders Five-0 to give Cole up or he will kill Sylvia and her child. [[United States Military Police|Military Police]] arrive to take Cole into their custody for going AWOL, with no other options McGarrett releases Cole into their custody. While in transport, Cole manages to break free. Cole exchanges himself for Sylvia and her child, the man's brother is about to shoot Cole but Five-0, who suspected Cole's next move, engages him and his men in a gun battle saving everyone.\n\nMcGarrett arranges for Cole's charges to be dropped. In McGarrett's office Cole notices the cipher and offers to reach out to his contacts to have it solved and McGarrett takes him up on the offer.

It was written and composed, as a collaboration among all the members of the band, for their second album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. Built around a piano [[riff]], the song features cryptic lyrics concerning themes of contrast and urgency. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].\n\nThe record debuted to critical and commercial success, with critics mainly commenting on the song's piano melody, and winning the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. It was released in the United Kingdom as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', where it reached number nine in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was released in the United States as the album's second single, it reached number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Considered to be one of Coldplay's [[signature song]]s, \"Clocks\" continues to garner critical acclaim, and is often placed on lists ranking the greatest songs of the 2000s and of all time, including being ranked 490th on [[Rolling Stone]]'s \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" list in 2010.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/coldplay-clocks-19691231|title=Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Songs' List|accessdate=7 September 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed during the late stages of production of [[Coldplay]]'s second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. A [[riff]] popped into [[Chris Martin]]'s mind late one night in Liverpool when he came into the studio, where he then developed it on piano.

However, Martin felt it was \"rubbish\"; they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release.<ref name=\"Webb\"/> After a headlining tour, Coldplay went on working \"Songs for #3\".

It was released in the United Kingdom as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', where it reached number nine in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was released in the United States as the album's second single, it reached number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Considered to be one of Coldplay's [[signature song]]s, \"Clocks\" continues to garner critical acclaim, and is often placed on lists ranking the greatest songs of the 2000s and of all time, including being ranked 490th on [[Rolling Stone]]'s \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" list in 2010.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/coldplay-clocks-19691231|title=Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Songs' List|accessdate=7 September 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed during the late stages of production of [[Coldplay]]'s second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''.
