He defeated [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]], 7\u20136(2), 6\u20134, 6\u20134, in the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] final, [[Rafael Nadal]], 7\u20136(7), 4\u20136, 7\u20136(3), 2\u20136, 6\u20132, in the final at [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], and [[Novak Djokovic]], 7\u20136(4), 7\u20136(2), 6\u20134, at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. However, Federer lost the [[2007 French Open]] final to Nadal, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 4\u20136. Federer made five ATP Masters Series 1000 Finals in 2007, but only won two of those, in Hamburg and Cincinnati. Federer won 1 ATP 500 series event in Dubai and at the US open he started wearing the traditional RF logo. He ended the year by winning the year-end championships for the fourth time. In December 2011 Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2007 season as the sixth greatest season of all-time during the open era.<ref>http://www.tennis.com/articles/templates/features.aspx?articleid=15346&zoneid=9</ref>\n\n==Year summary==\n\n===Early Hard Court Season===\nFederer entered the Australian Open with a 29 match winning streak dating back to [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]]. In the fourth round Federer faced future world no. 1 and multi-slam winner [[Novak Djokovic]] for the first time in a major, defeating him in straight sets. In the semifinals Federer faced American [[Andy Roddick]] in a highly anticipated rematch of the 2006 US Open final. Federer delivered a masterclass, crushing the American and delivering the most one sided match of their rivalry 6\u20134, 6\u20130, 6\u20132. Federer won his third [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and 10th Grand Slam singles title, defeating [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]] of [[Chile]] in the final. He became the first man since [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] in 1980 to win a Grand Slam singles tournament [[Tennis statistics#Winning a Grand Slam singles title without losing a set|without losing a set]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=55 |title=Bj\u00f6rn Borg-Tennis Hall of Fame |accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227175302/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=55 |archivedate=2007-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the end of the tournament Federer's winning streak stood at 36 consecutive matches, besting his previous career best 35 match winning streak in 2005.\n\nFederer next played in [[2007 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]] where he was a three time former champion. Federer again played Djokovic in the quarterfinals and prevailed in a tight three set match. He defeated [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the finals to capture his fourth Dubai title in the last five years. After his victory Federer's winning streak stood at 41 consecutive matches, just five shy of the all-time record held by [[Guillermo Vilas]] in 1977.\n\nEntering [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]], Federer was the three-time defending champion. He needed only to make the finals to tie Vilas' all-time record and if he won would have set a new all-time record for consecutive victories at 47.  His winning streak of 41 consecutive matches, however, ended when he lost to [[Guillermo Ca\u00f1as]] in the second round of the [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|Pacific Life Open]]. This was a surprising loss and the first time he had suffered a defeat in six months.\n\nThe following week at the [[2007 Sony Ericsson Open|Sony Ericsson Open]] in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], he entered as the two-time defending champion. This tournament was disappointing as Federer again lost to Ca\u00f1as, this time in the fourth round in three sets. However, he was awarded four [[ATP Awards]] during a ceremony at the tournament, making him the first player to receive four awards during the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/awards/default.asp |title=Federer claims record 4 ATP awards |accessdate=2007-03-28 |date=2007-03-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326170018/http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/awards/default.asp |archivedate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Federer scoops record four awards |date=2007-03-26 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/6497835.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2007-03-28 |language=}}</ref>\n\n===Clay Court Season===\n[[File:Federer Monte Carlo 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Federer during the 2007 clay season.]]\nFederer started his clay-court season by reaching his second consecutive final of the [[Monte Carlo Masters]]. He did not drop a set until the finals, but lost again to second seed Nadal.\n\nFederer also lost in the third round of the [[2007 Rome Masters|Internazionali d'Italia]] in Rome to [[Filippo Volandri]].<ref name=\"clay\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2872730 |title=Federer still has time to salvage a poor clay season |accessdate=2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614143319/http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2872730| archivedate= 14 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> It was the first time that he had lost to anyone other than Nadal on clay since the [[2005 Monte Carlo Masters]]. This defeat meant he had gone four tournaments without a title, his longest stretch since becoming world no. 1.<ref name=\"clay\" />\n\nFederer rebounded, however, to defeat Nadal on clay for the first time, winning his fourth [[2007 Hamburg Masters|Hamburg Masters]] title, and ending Nadal's clay court streak of 81 consecutive matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2876658 |title=Nadal's clay win streak comes to end at 81 |accessdate=2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622173322/http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2876658| archivedate= 22 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAfter his victory over Nadal on clay two weeks earlier in Hamburg, speculation started on whether Federer could become the first man since [[Rod Laver]] to hold all four major titles simultaneously. Entering [[2007 French Open|Roland Garros]] he was reigning champion of [[2006 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and a victory at the French would mark a historical non-calendar year Grand Slam. At the French Open, Federer raced through the tournament, dropping only one set before reaching the final for the second consecutive year. Entering the final Federer had a 27 match winning streak at the majors and was seeking revenge for his 4 set loss to Nadal in the [[2006 French Open|2006]] final. Federer played well in the final, but could not convert on the many opportunities he had to break the Nadal serve.  Federer was 0 for 10 on break point chances in the first set, and only 1 for 17 overall. The result was a defeat at the hands of his arch-rival for the second straight year at the French finals, in four sets.\n\n===Grass Court Season===\nOne day after the loss, Federer announced that he was withdrawing from his usual warm-up tournament in [[Gerry Weber Open|Halle]], which he had won the last four years, citing fatigue and fear of getting an injury.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.rogerfederer.com/en/rogers/news/newsdetail.cfm?uNewsID=569| title= Off Court&nbsp;\u2014 Roger Withdraws From Halle| publisher= Roger Federer Official Website| accessdate= 2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625064921/http://www.rogerfederer.com/en/rogers/news/newsdetail.cfm?uNewsID=569| archivedate= 2007-06-25| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Federer vs. Safin-Crop.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Federer serving during the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships]], where he won his record fifth consecutive title.]]\nHe, therefore, entered [[2007 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for the first time without having played a warm-up grass-court tournament. Federer, nevertheless, reached the finals of Wimbledon for the fifth time, only dropping one set. The final was a rematch of [[2006 Wimbledon|2006]] as Federer again faced his nemesis Rafael Nadal. The final would prove to be an epic, delivering the first five set final at Wimbledon since 2001. Federer won the first set in a tight tiebreaker which he won 9\u20137. Nadal responded in the second and took it 6\u20134, leveling the match at one set apiece. A pivotal third set was decided by another tiebreaker which Federer claimed 7\u20133. After the first three sets Federer was only one set away from his fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship. Nadal, however, refused to go down quietly and took the fourth set decisively by a score of 6\u20132. As they entered the ultimate fifth set both players knew the value of a single break. Federer faced two early fifth set crises when he found himself down double break point in the third and fifth games. Federer, however, saved all four break points to take a 3\u20132 lead. In the sixth game Federer finally broke the Nadal serve and closed out the championship 6\u20132 in the final set. This match marked the first time in Federer's career that he was pushed to a fifth set in the finals of a Slam and remained his only five set final victory at a major until [[2009 Wimbledon]]. With this victory Federer tied [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]]'s open-era men's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. He also tied Rod Laver and Borg Borg with 11 Grand Slam titles, moving into third place all-time.\n\n===Summer Hard Court Season===\nFederer began the hard-court season in August in Montreal at the [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]] as the defending champion. Federer advanced through the tournament without dropping a set and faced the young world no. 4 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the finals. Entering the final Federer had never lost to the young Serbian, holding a 4\u20130 record against him. The first set was a back and forth affair with Federer squandering triple set point on his own serve and losing the tiebreaker. Federer, however, ran away with the second set and forced a final set for the championship. Djokovic prevailed in a final-set tiebreaker, defeating Federer for the first time.\n\n[[File:The Mighty Federer Cropped 2.jpg|thumb|165px|Federer at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]], where he won his fourth consecutive title.]]\nThe following week Federer entered the [[2007 Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati Masters]]. He reached the final, surviving a final-set tiebreaker scare against [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the semifinals. Federer won the Cincinnati title for the second time, defeating [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] in the final. The victory was Federer's 50th career singles title, his 14th ATP Masters Series title, and made him the winner of the [[U.S. Open Series|2007 US Open Series]] points race.\n\nAs the winner of U.S. Open Series, Federer had never entered the [[2007 U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] in a stronger position. Federer lost the opening set in his third and fourth round matches before recovering to defeat [[John Isner]] and [[Feliciano L\u00f3pez]] respectively. His quarterfinal match was especially compelling since it was a rematch of the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 final]] against [[Andy Roddick]]. Federer defeated Roddick in straight sets in a match that featured two tiebreakers. Federer reached the finals and faced rising star and world no. 3 [[Novak Djokovic]] who had defeated Federer just a few weeks prior in the finals of Montreal. Djokovic started the match hot and quickly found himself at triple set point on his own serve. Federer saved all set points and snatched the first set in a close tiebreaker (it was an exact reversal of the first set just weeks before in Montreal). Djokovic would not yield, however, and again took Federer to a tiebreaker in the second set. Federer again prevailed in the tiebreaker and capitalized on this by taking a close third set as well. Federer's victory over the third seed Djokovic delivered his 12th Grand Slam singles title, and fourth consecutive US Open title. This victory moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of Grand Slam champions. As champion of the [[US Open Series]] points race, Federer received a bonus of $1 million, in addition to the $1.4 million prize for winning the US Open singles title. He became the only player in history to win three Grand Slams in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |title=Australian Open Men's Singles Champions |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=2009-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064147/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |archivedate=2010-01-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |title=Roland Garros Men's Singles Past Winners 1891\u20132011 |publisher=Roland Garros |accessdate=2012-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |title=Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals |publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |title=US Open Men's Singles Finals |publisher=US Open |accessdate=2009-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190523/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |archivedate=2009-02-22 }}</ref> Throughout the tournament the American press labeled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire and the tournament played [[The Imperial March]] from [[Star Wars]] when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.<ref>http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2007-09-09/297.php</ref> The Imperial March was also played by the tournament officials after the final match point, in honor of Federer's achievement.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljJLPKSeSAo</ref>\n\n===Fall Indoor Season===\nFederer began the indoor season as the defending champion at the [[2007 Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Masters Madrid|Madrid Masters]]. Fresh off wins at the Cincinnati Masters and the US Open, Federer was the clear favorite to win the tournament. He advanced to the finals without dropping a set and faced his early career nemesis [[David Nalbandian]]. Federer took the first set easily but was defeated in three sets by the red-hot Argentine. Notably, Nalbandian had consecutively beaten Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer in Madrid to claim his first masters title.\n\nFederer next entered his home-town tournament in [[2007 Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Basel]] as the defending champion. He dropped only one set en route to his second Basel title and his third title in his native Switzerland.\n\nThe last masters tournament of the year at [[2007 BNP Paribas Masters|Bercy]] was a brief affair for Federer who fell again to Nalbandian, this time in the third round. The streaking Argentine would go on to defeat Nadal in the finals of Bercy.\n\nFederer then finished the season at the year-end [[Tennis Masters Cup]]. Despite losing for the first time in the round-robin group to [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]], he regrouped against Roddick and Davydenko to advance. Federer went on to defeat Nadal in the semifinals and [[David Ferrer]] in the tournament finals to win his fourth [[Tennis Masters Cup]] title, finishing the season in style.\n\n==Season Accomplishments==\nFederer finished the year as the world no. 1 player for the fourth consecutive time, compiling an impressive 68\u20139 record. Due to his performance on the court and off-court personality, in 2007, Time magazine named him as one of the 100 most important persons in the world. [[Rod Laver]], one of the greatest players ever himself, described him as follows: \"One thing is for sure: he's the best player of his time and one of the most admirable champions on the planet. That's certainly something worth crowing over. The beauty is, Roger Federer won't.\".<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1615754_1615743,00.html |publisher=Time |accessdate=2007-05-03 |title=The Time 100 |date=2007-05-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505051242/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0%2C28804%2C1595326_1615754_1615743%2C00.html |archivedate=5 May 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Matches===\n\n====Grand Slam performance====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Federer again played Djokovic in the quarterfinals and prevailed in a tight three set match. He defeated [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the finals to capture his fourth Dubai title in the last five years. After his victory Federer's winning streak stood at 41 consecutive matches, just five shy of the all-time record held by [[Guillermo Vilas]] in 1977.\n\nEntering [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]], Federer was the three-time defending champion. He needed only to make the finals to tie Vilas' all-time record and if he won would have set a new all-time record for consecutive victories at 47.  His winning streak of 41 consecutive matches, however, ended when he lost to [[Guillermo Ca\u00f1as]] in the second round of the [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|Pacific Life Open]]. This was a surprising loss and the first time he had suffered a defeat in six months.\n\nThe following week at the [[2007 Sony Ericsson Open|Sony Ericsson Open]] in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], he entered as the two-time defending champion. This tournament was disappointing as Federer again lost to Ca\u00f1as, this time in the fourth round in three sets. However, he was awarded four [[ATP Awards]] during a ceremony at the tournament, making him the first player to receive four awards during the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/awards/default.asp |title=Federer claims record 4 ATP awards |accessdate=2007-03-28 |date=2007-03-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326170018/http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/awards/default.asp |archivedate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Federer scoops record four awards |date=2007-03-26 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/6497835.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2007-03-28 |language=}}</ref>\n\n===Clay Court Season===\n[[File:Federer Monte Carlo 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Federer during the 2007 clay season.]]\nFederer started his clay-court season by reaching his second consecutive final of the [[Monte Carlo Masters]]. He did not drop a set until the finals, but lost again to second seed Nadal.\n\nFederer also lost in the third round of the [[2007 Rome Masters|Internazionali d'Italia]] in Rome to [[Filippo Volandri]].<ref name=\"clay\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2872730 |title=Federer still has time to salvage a poor clay season |accessdate=2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614143319/http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2872730| archivedate= 14 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> It was the first time that he had lost to anyone other than Nadal on clay since the [[2005 Monte Carlo Masters]].

Entering [[2007 French Open|Roland Garros]] he was reigning champion of [[2006 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and a victory at the French would mark a historical non-calendar year Grand Slam. At the French Open, Federer raced through the tournament, dropping only one set before reaching the final for the second consecutive year. Entering the final Federer had a 27 match winning streak at the majors and was seeking revenge for his 4 set loss to Nadal in the [[2006 French Open|2006]] final. Federer played well in the final, but could not convert on the many opportunities he had to break the Nadal serve.  Federer was 0 for 10 on break point chances in the first set, and only 1 for 17 overall. The result was a defeat at the hands of his arch-rival for the second straight year at the French finals, in four sets.\n\n===Grass Court Season===\nOne day after the loss, Federer announced that he was withdrawing from his usual warm-up tournament in [[Gerry Weber Open|Halle]], which he had won the last four years, citing fatigue and fear of getting an injury.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.rogerfederer.com/en/rogers/news/newsdetail.cfm?uNewsID=569| title= Off Court&nbsp;\u2014 Roger Withdraws From Halle| publisher= Roger Federer Official Website| accessdate= 2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625064921/http://www.rogerfederer.com/en/rogers/news/newsdetail.cfm?uNewsID=569| archivedate= 2007-06-25| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Federer vs. Safin-Crop.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Federer serving during the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships]], where he won his record fifth consecutive title.]]\nHe, therefore, entered [[2007 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for the first time without having played a warm-up grass-court tournament. Federer, nevertheless, reached the finals of Wimbledon for the fifth time, only dropping one set. The final was a rematch of [[2006 Wimbledon|2006]] as Federer again faced his nemesis Rafael Nadal. The final would prove to be an epic, delivering the first five set final at Wimbledon since 2001. Federer won the first set in a tight tiebreaker which he won 9\u20137. Nadal responded in the second and took it 6\u20134, leveling the match at one set apiece. A pivotal third set was decided by another tiebreaker which Federer claimed 7\u20133. After the first three sets Federer was only one set away from his fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship. Nadal, however, refused to go down quietly and took the fourth set decisively by a score of 6\u20132. As they entered the ultimate fifth set both players knew the value of a single break. Federer faced two early fifth set crises when he found himself down double break point in the third and fifth games. Federer, however, saved all four break points to take a 3\u20132 lead. In the sixth game Federer finally broke the Nadal serve and closed out the championship 6\u20132 in the final set. This match marked the first time in Federer's career that he was pushed to a fifth set in the finals of a Slam and remained his only five set final victory at a major until [[2009 Wimbledon]]. With this victory Federer tied [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]]'s open-era men's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. He also tied Rod Laver and Borg Borg with 11 Grand Slam titles, moving into third place all-time.\n\n===Summer Hard Court Season===\nFederer began the hard-court season in August in Montreal at the [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]] as the defending champion. Federer advanced through the tournament without dropping a set and faced the young world no. 4 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the finals. Entering the final Federer had never lost to the young Serbian, holding a 4\u20130 record against him. The first set was a back and forth affair with Federer squandering triple set point on his own serve and losing the tiebreaker. Federer, however, ran away with the second set and forced a final set for the championship. Djokovic prevailed in a final-set tiebreaker, defeating Federer for the first time.\n\n[[File:The Mighty Federer Cropped 2.jpg|thumb|165px|Federer at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]], where he won his fourth consecutive title.]]\nThe following week Federer entered the [[2007 Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati Masters]]. He reached the final, surviving a final-set tiebreaker scare against [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the semifinals. Federer won the Cincinnati title for the second time, defeating [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] in the final. The victory was Federer's 50th career singles title, his 14th ATP Masters Series title, and made him the winner of the [[U.S. Open Series|2007 US Open Series]] points race.\n\nAs the winner of U.S. Open Series, Federer had never entered the [[2007 U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] in a stronger position. Federer lost the opening set in his third and fourth round matches before recovering to defeat [[John Isner]] and [[Feliciano L\u00f3pez]] respectively. His quarterfinal match was especially compelling since it was a rematch of the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 final]] against [[Andy Roddick]]. Federer defeated Roddick in straight sets in a match that featured two tiebreakers. Federer reached the finals and faced rising star and world no. 3 [[Novak Djokovic]] who had defeated Federer just a few weeks prior in the finals of Montreal. Djokovic started the match hot and quickly found himself at triple set point on his own serve. Federer saved all set points and snatched the first set in a close tiebreaker (it was an exact reversal of the first set just weeks before in Montreal). Djokovic would not yield, however, and again took Federer to a tiebreaker in the second set. Federer again prevailed in the tiebreaker and capitalized on this by taking a close third set as well. Federer's victory over the third seed Djokovic delivered his 12th Grand Slam singles title, and fourth consecutive US Open title. This victory moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of Grand Slam champions. As champion of the [[US Open Series]] points race, Federer received a bonus of $1 million, in addition to the $1.4 million prize for winning the US Open singles title. He became the only player in history to win three Grand Slams in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |title=Australian Open Men's Singles Champions |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=2009-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064147/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |archivedate=2010-01-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |title=Roland Garros Men's Singles Past Winners 1891\u20132011 |publisher=Roland Garros |accessdate=2012-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |title=Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals |publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |title=US Open Men's Singles Finals |publisher=US Open |accessdate=2009-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190523/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |archivedate=2009-02-22 }}</ref> Throughout the tournament the American press labeled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire and the tournament played [[The Imperial March]] from [[Star Wars]] when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.<ref>http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2007-09-09/297.php</ref> The Imperial March was also played by the tournament officials after the final match point, in honor of Federer's achievement.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljJLPKSeSAo</ref>\n\n===Fall Indoor Season===\nFederer began the indoor season as the defending champion at the [[2007 Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Masters Madrid|Madrid Masters]]. Fresh off wins at the Cincinnati Masters and the US Open, Federer was the clear favorite to win the tournament. He advanced to the finals without dropping a set and faced his early career nemesis [[David Nalbandian]]. Federer took the first set easily but was defeated in three sets by the red-hot Argentine. Notably, Nalbandian had consecutively beaten Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer in Madrid to claim his first masters title.\n\nFederer next entered his home-town tournament in [[2007 Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Basel]] as the defending champion. He dropped only one set en route to his second Basel title and his third title in his native Switzerland.\n\nThe last masters tournament of the year at [[2007 BNP Paribas Masters|Bercy]] was a brief affair for Federer who fell again to Nalbandian, this time in the third round. The streaking Argentine would go on to defeat Nadal in the finals of Bercy.\n\nFederer then finished the season at the year-end [[Tennis Masters Cup]]. Despite losing for the first time in the round-robin group to [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]], he regrouped against Roddick and Davydenko to advance. Federer went on to defeat Nadal in the semifinals and [[David Ferrer]] in the tournament finals to win his fourth [[Tennis Masters Cup]] title, finishing the season in style.\n\n==Season Accomplishments==\nFederer finished the year as the world no. 1 player for the fourth consecutive time, compiling an impressive 68\u20139 record. Due to his performance on the court and off-court personality, in 2007, Time magazine named him as one of the 100 most important persons in the world. [[Rod Laver]], one of the greatest players ever himself, described him as follows: \"One thing is for sure: he's the best player of his time and one of the most admirable champions on the planet. That's certainly something worth crowing over. The beauty is, Roger Federer won't.\".<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1615754_1615743,00.html |publisher=Time |accessdate=2007-05-03 |title=The Time 100 |date=2007-05-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505051242/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0%2C28804%2C1595326_1615754_1615743%2C00.html |archivedate=5 May 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Matches===\n\n====Grand Slam performance====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
