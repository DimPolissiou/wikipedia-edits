Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE. The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] travelled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish...to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character...but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming...I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-39|F|1}} on December 21, 1871.<ref name=\"December 1871\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Peterborough ([[Trent University]]), 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes

In addition, Highway 115 crosses the river near the southern edge of the city. There are also numerous other bridges which cross the Trent Canal (notably the crossing at the lift lock which actually passes under the canal), Jackson Creek and the other minor creeks in the city. There are also numerous other river crossings throughout the CMA, the longest of which is the [[James A. Gifford Causeway]], which crosses Chemong Lake linking Bridgenorth with Ennismore.\n\n[[Public transit]] in the city of Peterborough is currently run by [[Peterborough Transit]], providing a total of 12 regular and 5 express routes throughout the city. Peterborough Transit's hub is a central terminal located on Simcoe Street in the city's downtown core.

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128\n| title = Film crew jumps around the city\n|website = mykawartha.com\n|date = September 5, 2006\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish...to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character...but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming...I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128\n| title = Film crew jumps around the city\n|website = mykawartha.com\n|date = September 5, 2006\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

{"title_page": "Contact electrification", "text_new": "'''Contact electrification''' was an erroneous scientific theory from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that attempted to account for all the sources of [[Electrical charge|electric charge]] known at the time.<ref>Willem Hackmann,  \"[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's \"Contact Tension\" and the Development of the \"Dry Pile\"]\", appearing in ''[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times] Volume 3'' (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000) pp. 103-119</ref> It has since been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]] by more modern notions.  In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as [[Electrostatics|electrostatic charge]] imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or ''contact tension'',  was quickly discovered. \n\nWhen two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, [[Voltaic pile]]s, could also produce charge differences.  Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - [[triboelectricity]], the Volta effect, differing [[work function]]s of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called 'frictional' [[electrostatic generator]]s such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to the development of useful devices such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s, [[electroplating]], [[thermocouple]]s. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including [[crystal radio receiver|radio detector diodes]], [[solar cell|photocell]]s, [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, and [[thermoelectric cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe theory held that static electricity was generated by means of contact between dissimilar materials, and was in close agreement with the principles of [[static electricity]] as then understood. It was eventually replaced by the current theory of [[electrochemistry]], namely, that electricity is generated by the action of [[chemistry]] and the exchange of [[electron]]s between [[atom]]s making up the battery.  An important fact leading to the rejection of the theory of contact tension was the observation that [[corrosion]], that is, the chemical degradation of the battery, seemed unavoidable with its use, and that the more electricity was drawn from the battery, the faster the corrosion proceeded.\n\nThe Volta effect (described below) corresponds to a weak [[electric potential]] difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a [[contact potential difference]]. This effect was first discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]], and can be measured using a [[capacitance electroscope]] comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries.\n\nA number of [[high voltage]] [[dry pile]]s were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the answer to this question, and specifically to support Volta\u2019s hypothesis of contact tension. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] is one example. [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact, even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Triboelectric contact==\n{{main|Triboelectric effect}}\nIf two different [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] are touched together, such as when a piece of rubber is touched against a piece of glass, then the surface of the rubber will acquire an excess negative charge, and the glass will acquire an equal positive charge.  If the surfaces are then pulled apart, a very [[high voltage]] is produced.  This so-called \"tribo\" or \"rubbing\" effect is not well understood.  It may be caused by electron-stealing via [[quantum tunneling]], or by transfer of surface ions.  Friction is not required, although in many situations it greatly increases the phenomenon.  Certain phenomena related to frictionally generated electrostatic charges have been known since antiquity, though of course the modern theory of electricity was developed after the [[Scientific Revolution]].\n\n===Solid-solid contact===\nThe mechanism of contact electrification (CE) between solid-solid has been debated for more than 2600 years. A most controversial topic in CE is the identity of the charge carriers: electron transfer, ion transfer or even materials species transfer. Recent studies by using Kelvin probe force microscopy suggest that electron transfer is the dominating charge carrier in CE for solid-solid cases.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z.L. |last2=Wang |first2=A.C. |title=On the origin of contact electrification |journal=Materials Today |date=2019 |volume=30 |page=34 |doi=10.1016/j.mattod.2019.05.016}}</ref> When the interatomic distance between two atoms belonging to two materials is shorter than the normal bonding length (typically ~0.2 nm), the electrons will transfer at the interface. It implies that a strong electron cloud overlap (or wave function overlap) between the two atoms/molecules in the repulsive region will reduce the interatomic potential barrier (Fig. 1), and result in electron transition between the atoms/molecules. The contact/friction force in CE is to induce strong overlap between the electron clouds (or wave function in physics, bonding in chemistry).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=C. |last2=Zi |first2=Y. |last3=Wang |first3=A.C. |last4=Zou |first4=H. |last5=Dai |first5=Y. |last6=He |first6=X. |last7=Wang |first7=P. |last8=Wang |first8=C. |last9=Feng |first9=P. |last10=Li |first10=D. |last11=Wang |first11=Z.L. |title=On Electron Transfer Mechanism in Contact-Electrification Effect |journal=Advanced Materials |date=2018 |volume=30 |page=1706790 |doi=10.1002/adma.201706790}}</ref>\n[[File:Overlapped electron-cloud model.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1 The overlapped electron-cloud (OEC) model for general case contact-electrification.]]\n\n===Liquid-solid contact===\nBesides ion transfer at liquid-solid interface, electron transfer occurs as well. As for the liquid-solid case, molecules in the liquid would have electron cloud overlap with the atoms on the solid surface at the very first contact with a virginal solid surface,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lin |first1=S.Q. |last2=Xu |first2=L. |last3=Wang |first3=A.C. |last4=Wang |first4=Z.L. |title=Quantifying electron-transfer and ion-transfer in liquid-solid contact electrification and the formation mechanism of electric double-layer |journal=Nature Communication |date=2020 |volume=11 |page=399 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-14278-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nie |first1=J.H. |last2=Ren |first2=Z. |last3=Xu |first3=L. |last4=Lin |first4=S.Q. |last5=Zhan |first5=F. |last6=Chen |first6=X.Y. |last7=Wang |first7=Z.L. |title=Probing Contact Electrification Induced Electron and Ion Transfers at a Liquid-Solid Interface |journal=Advanced Materials |date=2019 |volume=31 |page=1905696 |doi=10.1002/adma.201905696}}</ref> and electron transfer is required in order to create the first layer of electrostatic charges on the solid surface. Then, ion transfer is the second step, which is a redistribution of the ions in solution considering electrostatic interactions with the charged solid surface (Fig. 2). Both electron transfer and ion transfer co-exist at liquid-solid interface.\n[[File:Two-step model for EDL.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2 The \"two-step\" model (Wang model) for the formation of electric double-layer (EDL) at a liquid-solid interface, in which the electron transfer plays a dominate role in the first step.]]\n\n==Electrolytic-metallic contact==\nIf a piece of metal is touched against an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] material, the metal will spontaneously become charged, while the electrolyte will acquire an equal and opposite charge.  Upon first contact, a chemical reaction called a '[[half-cell reaction]]' occurs on the metal surface.  As metal ions are transferred to or from the electrolyte, and as the metal and electrolyte become oppositely charged, the increasing voltage at the thin insulating [[electrical double layer|layer]] between metal and electrolyte will oppose the motion of the flowing ions, causing the chemical reaction to come to a stop.  If a second piece of a different type of metal is placed in the same electrolyte bath, it will charge up and rise to a different voltage.  If the first metal piece is touched against the second, the voltage on the two metal pieces will be forced closer together, and the chemical reactions will run constantly.  In this way the 'contact electrification' becomes continuous.  At the same time, an electric current will appear, with the path forming a closed loop which leads from one metal part to the other, through the chemical reactions on the first metal surface, through the electrolyte, then back through the chemical reactions on the second metal surface.  In this way, contact electrification leads to the invention of the [[Galvanic cell]] or [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. ''See also: [[Dry pile]]''\n\n==Metallic contact==\n{{main|Galvani potential}}\n{{main|Volta potential}}\nIf two metals having differing [[work function]]s are touched together, one steals electrons from the other, and the opposite net charges grow larger and larger; this is the Volta effect.  The process is halted when the difference in [[electric potential]] (electrostatic potential) between the two metals reaches a particular value, namely the difference in work function values - usually less than one volt.  At this point, the Fermi levels for the two metals are equal, and there is no voltage difference between them. [If there were a voltage difference between them, then a current would flow between them:  so \"zero current\" implies \"zero voltage difference\".]\n\n==Semiconductor contact==\nIf a metal touches a semiconductor material, or if two different semiconductors are placed into contact, one becomes charged slightly positive and the other slightly negative.  It is found that if this junction between semiconductors is connected to a power supply, and if the power supply is set to a voltage slightly higher than the natural voltage appearing because of contact electrification, then for one polarity of voltage there will be a current between the two semiconductor parts, but if the polarity is reversed, the current stops.  Thus contact between materials lead to the invention of the semiconductor [[diode]] or [[rectifier]] and triggered the revolution in [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronics]] and [[Semiconductor physics|physics]].\n\nIn materials with a [[direct band gap]], if bright light is aimed at one part of the contact area between the two semiconductors, the voltage at that spot will rise, and an electric current will appear.  When considering light in the context of contact electrification{{what|date=April 2014}}, the light energy is changed directly into electrical energy, allowing creation of [[solar cell]]s.  Later it was found that the same process can be reversed, and if a current is forced backwards across the contact region between the semiconductors, sometimes light will be emitted, allowing creation of the [[light-emitting diode]] (LED).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Contact Electrification}}\n[[Category:Electrical phenomena]]\n[[Category:History of physics]]\n[[Category:Obsolete scientific theories]]\n", "text_old": "'''Contact electrification''' was an erroneous scientific theory from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that attempted to account for all the sources of [[Electrical charge|electric charge]] known at the time.<ref>Willem Hackmann,  \"[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's \"Contact Tension\" and the Development of the \"Dry Pile\"]\", appearing in ''[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times] Volume 3'' (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000) pp. 103-119</ref> It has since been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]] by more modern notions.

In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour\", rather it is \"interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the \u2013 subject labourers\".<ref name=\"Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin\">{{cite web|author=Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin|url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ|publisher=Infoshop.org|accessdate=2010-09-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6|archivedate=2010-11-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]\n[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.<ref name=\"Woodcock, George p. 100\">Woodcock, George.

He thus saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\".

While both groups argued against [[capitalism]], the anarcho-communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. As Errico Malatesta put it, \"instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common.

Ironically, the \"collectivist\" label then became more commonly associated with [[Marxism|Marxist]] state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of [[wage system]] during the transition to full [[communism]]. Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay, \"The Collectivist Wages System\", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892. Cafiero explains in ''[[Anarchy and Communism]]'' (1880) that private property in the product of labor will lead to unequal [[accumulation of capital]] and therefore the reappearance of [[social class]]es and their antagonisms; and thus the resurrection of the state: \"If we preserve the individual appropriation of the products of labour, we would be forced to preserve money, leaving more or less accumulation of wealth according to more or less merit rather than need of individuals\".<ref name=\"Graham-2005\">Robert Graham, ''Anarchism \u2013 A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas \u2013 Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005</ref> At the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International in 1876, held in a forest outside [[Florence]] due to [[police]] activity, they declared the principles of anarcho-communism.\n\n=== Anarchism economics in practice: the Spanish Revolution ===\n{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Anarchist Catalonia}}\nIn the strong [[anarchism in Spain|anarchist movement in Spain]], the debate between collectivism and anarcho-communism was revived: \"This double base, both industrial and rural, had turned the [[libertarian communism]] of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] in somewhat divergent directions, the one communalist, the other syndicalist. The communalism was expressed in a more local, more rural spirit, one might almost say: more southern, for one of its principal bastions was in [[Andalusia]]. Syndicalism, on the other hand, was more urban and unitarian in spirit \u2013 more northerly, too, since its main center was [[Catalonia]]\".<ref name=\"libcom1970\">[http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-daniel-guerin-3c ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''] by [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]].

A section of them had given their hearts to Peter Kropotkin and his erudite yet simplistic idealization of the [[commune]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] which they identified with the Spanish tradition of the primitive peasant community. Their favorite slogan was the \"free commune\". Mikhail Bakunin was the founder of the Spanish collectivist, syndicalist and internationalist workers' movement. Those anarchists tended to follow him and his disciple [[Ricardo Mella]].<ref name=\"libcom1970\"/> They were concerned with economic unification and believed that a long transitional period would be necessary during which it would be wiser to reward labor according to the hours worked and not according to need.

The land, the factories, the mines, the means of transport are the product of the work of all and must be at the service of all.

The factories were largely taken over by the workers and run by C.N.T. committees, while hundreds of villages either shared out or collectivized the land, and many of them attempted to set up libertarian communes of the kind advocated by Kropotkin\".\n:The beginnings of collectivization seem to have been similar in villages and factories. The landlords in the villages had fled, the Civil Guards had been killed or chased away, and the village syndicate would transform itself into a popular assembly in which every villager could participate directly in the affairs of the community. An administrative committee would be elected, but this would operate under the constant supervision of the population, meeting at least once a week in full assembly to hasten the achievement of free communism. In the factories the process was similar, with a workers' committee becoming responsible to the general assembly of the syndicate, and technicians (in a few cases the former owners or managers) planning production in accordance with the workers' views.<ref name=\"autogenerated1962\"/>\n\n== Theoretical economic systems ==\n=== Classical theoretical economic systems ===\nIn a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical\u2014those created throughout the 19th century\u2014and post-classical anarchist schools\u2013those created since the mid-20th century and after.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with [[trade]] representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

Also in 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a \"mutualist township\" by Joshua King Ingalls<ref>Joshua King Ingalls, \"A Practical Movement for Transition\", Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202\u201304.</ref> and Albert Brisbane,<ref>Albert Brisbane, \"The Mutualist Township\", The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179\u201383.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200\u201302.</ref> together with works by Proudhon,<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \"The Coming Era of Mutualism\", ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107\u201308.</ref> Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]] and others.\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent...that [[Proudhonian]] Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the [[Individualist anarchism|Individualist Anarchism]] of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...William B.

Mutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in Owenite circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the Time Store of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and individualist anarchist Josiah Warren. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with William Batchelder Greene, but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]] and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.\n\nMutualists argue that [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|association]] is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other; and without association, they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave. An operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form, and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs, etc.\n\nMutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist and author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Kevin Carson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415135834/http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=2011-04-15}}.

Mikhail Bakunin wrote that \"we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism\", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian (\"Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism\", 1867).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\nThe dispute between Bakunin and Marx highlighted the differences between anarchism and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued\u2014against certain ideas of a number of Marxists\u2014that not all revolutions need be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\", a concept that [[Vanguardism|vanguardist socialism]] including [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] would use to justify [[one-party rule]] from above by a party claiming to represent the [[proletariat]].<ref name=GW158>Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.</ref> Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any \"enlightened elite\" must only exert influence by remaining \"[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance\".<ref name=\"Struggle.ws\">{{citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.<ref name=GW158/> Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the \"[[new class]]\", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat\u2014but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the \"[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls \u2013 or, if you will, rises \u2013 to the position of a machine\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such, \"[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the [[lumpenproletariat]] (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/marxism-and-anarchism-the-philosophical-roots-of-the-marx-bakunin-conflict/|title=Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict - WorkersCompass.org - Published by Workers Action|date=21 June 2002|publisher=}}</ref> Bakunin \"considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form \u2013 the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat\".<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. \"The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable\" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics'']</ref>\n\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that \"the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government\" in which each worker will have the \"right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting\". This revolutionary transformation could \"only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes\".<ref name=\"blackrosebooks.net\"/> A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by anarchist veteran of the First International Jose Llunas Pujols in his essay, \"Collectivism\".<ref name=\"blackrosebooks.net\"/>\n\nThe difference between collectivist anarchism and anarcho-communism is that collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while anarcho-communism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group.<ref name=\"proudhon395\">Proudhon. ''What is Property'', pp. 395\u201396</ref><ref>Berkman, Alexander.

''Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets'', p. 162</ref> Thus it could be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.\n\nThe ''[[An Anarchist FAQ|Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with communist anarchism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of \"money\" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, \"[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself.\"<ref>[Anarchism, p. 295]</ref> Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed.

They further argue that markets and systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical values to an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption and distribution. They argue that money restricts an individual's ability to consume the products of their labor by limiting their intake with prices and wages.\n\nAnarcho-communists recognize money as fundamentally quantitative in nature, rather than qualitative. They believe production should be a qualitative matter and that consumption and distribution should be self-determined by each individual without arbitrary value assigned to labor, goods and services by others. In place of a market, most anarcho-communists support a [[currency]]-less [[gift economy]] where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as \"payment\" for their production of goods and services.\n\nA gift economy does not necessarily involve an immediate return (such as with remuneration) as compensation comes in the form of whatever the person decides is of equal value to their products of labor (what is commonly called [[barter]]ing). Any limits on production and distribution would be determined by the individuals within the groups involved, rather than by capitalist owners, corporations, investors, banks or other artificial market pressures. Crucially, the abstract relationship of \"landlord\" and \"tenant\" would no longer exist as such titles are held to occur under conditional legal coercion and are not absolutely necessary to occupy buildings or spaces ([[intellectual property]] rights would also cease since they are a form of private property).\n\n===== Evolution and role in early 20th century revolutions =====\n[[File:La conqu\u00eate du pain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, an influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\nAnarcho-communism developed out of radical [[Socialism|socialist]] currents after the [[French Revolution]],<ref name=\"Graham-2005\" /><ref>[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__The_Great_French_Revolution_1789-1793.html#toc42 \"Chapter 41: The \"Anarchists\"\" in ''The Great French Revolution 1789\u20131793'' by Peter Kropotkin]</ref> but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111\u201313\">Nunzio Pernicone, \"Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892\", pp. 111\u201313, AK Press 2009.</ref> An early anarcho-communist was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]], the first person to describe himself as \"[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]\".<ref name=\"Dejacque\"/> Unlike Proudhon, he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\".<ref name=\"Graham-2005\" /><ref name=\"joseph.dejacque.free.fr\"/>\n\nAnarcho-communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]] by [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], Errico Malatesta, [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex Mazzinian republicans.<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111\u201313\"/> Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/> The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to extend the concept of collective ownership to the products of labor as well.\n\nWhile both groups argued against capitalism, the anarchist communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production.

Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist [[market economy|market economies]] and also an alternative to [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[socialism]], it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\"<ref>Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016053719/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm |date=October 16, 2008 }} Chapter 19 Individuals / Society</ref> and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers.\n\nThe underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[social solidarity|solidarity]], diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency (efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:\n* [[Workers' council|Workers']] and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making\n* [[Balanced job complex]]es\n* [[Remuneration]] according to effort and sacrifice\n* [[Parecon#Participatory planning|Participatory planning]]\n\nAlbert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of [[politics]], [[culture]] and [[kinship]]. The authors have also discussed elements of anarchism in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture and [[feminism]] in the field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. [[Stephen R. Shalom]] has begun work on a participatory political vision he calls \"[[participatory politics|parpolity]]\".\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\nAccording to the Inclusive Democracy (ID) project, economic democracy is the authority of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] (community) in the economic sphere, which requires equal distribution of economic power. As with the case of [[direct democracy]], [[economic democracy]] today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the demos. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power: capitalist and \"socialist\" [[Economic growth|growth]] economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as [[workers' control]] and milder versions suggested by [[post-Keynesian]] [[Social democracy|social democrats]]. The demos therefore becomes the authentic unit of economic life.\n\nThe main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of: (a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens\u2014which requires that basic macro-economic decisions have to be made democratically; and (b) securing freedom of choice\u2014which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume and so on).\n\nTherefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly; and (2) an artificial market using personal vouchers, which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]], but it avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system \"a form of money based on the labour theory of value\",<ref>David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996, p. 321</ref> it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, parecon guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only to the extent they are characterized public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.<ref>Michael Albert, ''[http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231141221/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm |date=2009-12-31 }}'', Verso Books, 2003, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\n==== Free-market anarchism ====\n{{main|Free-market anarchism}}\n{{see also|Anarcho-capitalism|Left-wing market anarchism}}\n{{further|Anarchism and capitalism}}\nFree-market anarchism, based on the economic theories of mutualism and individualist anarchism, is a revival of such free-market anarchist theories.<ref>Zwolinski, Matt (9 January 2013).

Indeed, capitalists prefer centralised, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population. Capitalism was born under such states and as well as backing fascist movements, they made high profits in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues.

As such, \"anarchists can often be found advocating for mass refusal and the withdrawal of our participation-sometimes in the form of [[general strike]]s; sometimes as in the case of the [[Illegalism|illegalists]], in the forms of direct expropriations \u2013 with the support and participation of social movements or not; sometimes in the forms of occupations and the taking of space; and still other times in advocating for creating alternatives to capitalist relations in the here and now; and so on\".<ref>Various Authors.

However, Warren reached different conclusions as he believed that goods and services should trade according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to how individuals believed them to be [[subjective theory of value|subjectively worth]]. Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\".<ref name=Slate/> To charge more labor for something that entailed less labor was \"cannibalism\", according to him.<ref>\"If a priest is required to get a soul out of purgatory, he sets his price according to the value which the relatives set upon his prayers, instead of their cost to the priest. This, again, is cannibalism. The same amount of labor equally disagreeable, with equal wear and tear, performed by his customers, would be a just remuneration\". Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''</ref> Moreover, he believed that trading according to \"cost the limit of price\" would promote increasing efficiency in an economy, as he explains in ''Equitable Commerce'': {{quote|text=If cost is made the limit of price, every one becomes interested in reducing COST, by bringing in all the economies, all the facilities to their aid. But, on the contrary, if cost does not govern the price, but every thing is priced at what it will bring, there are no such co-operating interests.\n\nIf I am to have my supply of flour at cost, then, any facility I can afford to the wheat grower, reduces the cost to me, and it does the same for all who have any portion of the wheat, I am promoting all their interests while pursuing my own...Now if the wheat were NOT TO BE SOLD TO us AT COST, but at \"whatever it would bring\" according to our necessities, then none of us would have any interest in affording facilities, repairing breaches, nor in any other way co-operating with the producer of it. The same motive would act in the production, preservation, and use of every thing.\"<ref>Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''. pp. 77\u201378.</ref>}}\n\nHe put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store at the corner of 5th and Elm Streets in what is now downtown Cincinnati, where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor: \"All the goods offered for sale in Warren's store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them, plus a small surcharge, in the neighborhood of 4 to 7 percent, to cover store overhead\".<ref name=Mises>Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-02-25) [https://mises.org/daily/5067/Josiah-Warren-The-First-American-Anarchist Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist], ''[[Mises Institute]]''</ref> The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.<ref name=\"Charles A. Madison 1945 p. 53\"/>\n\n==== Energy credits ====\nThe theory that all values can be evaluated in terms of [[joules]]. In the same vein as the labor theory of value, this is an attempt to make a normative basis for value by accounting for [[embodied energy]]. Accounting for such a system would be vastly more complex than current or other theoretical currency systems because all energy output of workers and energy expenditure on goods/services must be tracked (something that is thought impossible and useless by many anarchists).\n\nOne group that has advocated a system using energy is the [[technocracy movement]] with a system based on [[energy accounting]] where energy is used to \"buy\" a product or service without being exchanged, so the effect is that products or services are distributed to the user without gain by the provider (who has the same amount of energy in his or her account regardless) so allegedly making profit impossible.\n\n=== Workers issues and anarcho-syndicalism ===\n{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\nAnarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism which focuses on the [[Labor rights|labour movement]].<ref>Georges Sorel in Stuart Isaacs & Chris Sparks, ''Political Theorists in Context'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 248. {{ISBN|0-415-20126-8}}</ref> ''Syndicalisme'' is a French word, ultimately derived from the Greek, meaning \"[[trade unionism]]\"\u2014hence, the \"[[syndicalism]]\" qualification. Syndicalism is an alternative [[co-operative economics|co-operative economic system]]. Adherents view it as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.\n\n[[File:Manifestaci\u00f3n CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|250px|2010 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[trade union]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]\nThe basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system, regarding it as \"[[wage slavery]]\" and state or private ownership of the [[means of production]], which they believe lead to class divisions. Not all seek to abolish money per se. [[Ralph Chaplin]] states that \"the ultimate aim of the General Strike as regards wages is to give to each producer the full product of his labor. The demand for better wages becomes revolutionary only when it is coupled with the demand that the exploitation of labor must cease\".<ref>Chaplin, Ralph, 1933, ''The General Strike for Industrial Freedom'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, anarcho-syndicalists regard the state as a profoundly anti-worker institution. They view the primary purpose of the state as being the defence of private property and therefore of economic, social and political privilege, even when such defence denies its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy which springs from it.<ref>''Anarchosyndicalism.net'': {{cite web |url=http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618075029/http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |archivedate=2013-06-18 }}</ref> In contrast to other bodies of thought ([[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] being a prime example), anarcho-syndicalists deny that there can be any kind of [[workers' state]], or a state which acts in the interests of workers, as opposed to those of the rich and powerful.

It has been variously advocated by anarchists, [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Communism|communists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and has been combined with various [[socialist economics|socialist]] and [[mixed economy]] systems. [[Workers' council]]s are a form of workers' control.\n\nFor Proudhon, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] involved creating \"industrial democracy\", a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic\".<ref>Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62</ref> He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". This would result in \"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\".<ref>''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277,  281</ref> Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.[[Council communism]], such as in the early Soviet Union advocated workers' control through workers councils and [[factory committee]]s. [[Syndicalism]] advocates workers' control through [[trade unions]]. [[Guild socialism]] advocates workers' control through a revival of the [[guild]] system. [[Participatory economics]] represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.\n\nWorkers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state such as [[nationalisation]] and [[central planning]] (see [[state socialism]]) and private control of the means of production as found in capitalism. A worker cooperative is a [[cooperative]] owned and democratically managed by its worker-owners. This control may be exercised in a number of ways. A cooperative enterprise may mean a firm where every worker-owner participates in [[decision making]] in a democratic fashion, or it may refer to one in which managers and administration is elected by every worker-owner and finally it can refer to a situation in which managers are considered and treated as, workers of the firm.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk\">[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/57/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2009) \"Cooperative Social Enterprises: Company Rules, Access to Finance and Management Practice\", ''Social Enterprise Journal'', 5(1), forthcoming]</ref>\n\nIn traditional forms of worker cooperative, all shares are held by the workforce with no outside or consumer owners and each member has one voting share. In practice, control by worker owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis).<ref name=\"digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk\"/> A worker cooperative therefore has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce own shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce.<ref name=\"ICA\">[http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/live/images/cme_resources/Public/governance/Worker%20co-op%20governance/ICA.pdf ICA (2005) World Declaration on Worker Cooperatives, Approved by the ICA General Assembly in Cartagena, Colombia, 23 September 2005].</ref>\n\nNevertheless, anarcho-communism has been critical of workers ownership of large means of production for the following reasons: \"Whereas the syndicalist alternative re-privatizes the economy into \"self-managed\" collectives and opens the way to their degeneration into traditional forms of private property \u2013 whether \"collectively\" owned or not \u2013 [[libertarian municipalism]] politicizes the economy and dissolves it into the civic domain. Neither factory or land appear as separate interests within the communal collective. Nor can workers, farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals, and the like perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies. \"Property\" is integrated into the commune as a material constituent of its libertarian institutional framework, indeed as a part of a larger whole that is controlled by the citizen body in assembly as citizens \u2013 not as vocationally oriented interest groups\".<ref name=Bookchin />\n\n=== Forms of exchange ===\nAnarchist economist Kevin Carson manifests that \"[l]ocal currencies, barter networks and mutual credit\u2010clearing systems are a solution to a basic problem: a world in which there is a lot of work to be done, but there is simply no money around to bring the people and the work together\".<ref>Kevin Carson. ''The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low\u2010Overhead Manifesto''. BOOSURGE. 2010. p. 274</ref>\n\n==== Alternate currency ====\n{{main|alternative currency}}\nAn alternative currency is any [[currency]] used as an alternative to the dominant national or multinational currency systems (usually referred to as national or [[Fiat currency|fiat money]]). Alternative currencies can be created by an individual, corporation, or organization, they can be created by national, state, or local governments, or they can arise naturally as people begin to use a certain commodity as a currency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency.\n\nWhen used in combination with or when designed to work in combination with national or multinational fiat currencies they can be referred to as [[complementary currency]]. Most complementary currencies are also [[local currency|local currencies]] and are limited to a certain region. Barters are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which only trade items; thus without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[local exchange trading system]] is a special form of barter which trades points for items. One point stands for one man-hour of work and often there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country as some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==== Labor notes and local exchange trading systems ====\n{{main|Labor notes (currency)|Local exchange trading system}}\nLabour notes are an [[alternative currency]] based on exchange of hours of labor. Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Josiah Warren termed the phrase \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\", with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with labour notes indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\".<ref name=Slate/>\n\nHe put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism.

For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.\n\n=== Credit and banking ===\n{{main|Mutual credit|free banking}}\n[[File:Wbg-masonicportrait.png|thumb|[[William Batchelder Greene]], [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchist]] activist and theorist for [[free banking]]]]\nAnarchist mutualists argued that free banking should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[mutual savings bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Batchelder Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are LETS and the [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple monetary system]] project.\n\nIn a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, which was turned down by the legislature.<ref>Anderson, Edwin Robert. 1911.

''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. p 46.</ref>\n\nAmerican mutualist William Batchelder Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system. In 1850 and 1851, he organized citizens of Brookfield, Warren and Ware, [[Massachusetts]], to petition the state's General Court for a charter to establish a [[mutual savings bank|mutual bank]]: \"Upon all the petitions, the Committee on Banks and Banking, after hearing the arguments of the petitioners, reported simply, \"Leave to withdraw!\" (''The Radical Deficiency of the Existing Circulating Medium'' 1857). Similar attempts by the New England Labor Reform League in the 1870s met with similar results. Greene's mutualist banking ideas resembled those of Proudhon as well as the \"land banks\" of the colonial period. He had an important influence on Benjamin Tucker, the editor of the anarchist journal ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]''.\n\nDuring the episode known as the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], contemporary anarchist theorist [[Peter Gelderloos]] reports the following: {{cquote|[...] For better or worse, the Spanish revolutionaries also experimented with Peasant Banks, Labor Banks, and Councils of Credit and Exchange. The Levant Federation of Peasant Collectives started a bank organized by the Bank Workers Union to help farmers draw from a broad pool of social resources needed for certain infrastructure- or resource-intensive types of farming. The Central Labor Bank of Barcelona moved credit from more prosperous collectives to socially useful collectives in need. Cash transactions were kept to a minimum, and credit was transferred as credit. The Labor Bank also arranged foreign exchange, and importation and purchase of raw materials. Where possible, payment was made in commodities, not in cash. The bank was not a for-profit enterprise; it charged only 1% interest to defray expenses. [[Diego Abad de Santillan]], the anarchist economist, said in 1936: \"Credit will be a social function and not a private speculation or usury... Credit will be based on the economic possibilities of society and not on interests or profit... The Council of Credit and Exchange will be like a thermometer of the products and needs of the country.\"[52] In this experiment, money functioned as a symbol of social support and not as a symbol of ownership  \u2013  it signified resources being transferred between unions of producers rather than investments by speculators. Within a complex industrial economy such banks make exchange and production more efficient, though they also present the risk of centralization or the reemergence of capital as a social force. Furthermore, efficient production and exchange as a value should be viewed with suspicion, at the least, by people interested in liberation. There are a number of methods that could prevent institutions such as labor banks from facilitating the return of capitalism, though unfortunately the onslaught of totalitarianism from both the fascists and Communists deprived Spanish anarchists of the chance to develop them. These might include rotating and mixing tasks to prevent the emergence of a new managing class, developing fragmented structures that cannot be controlled at a central or national level, promoting as much decentralization and simplicity as possible, and maintaining a firm tradition that common resources and instruments of social wealth are never for sale.|author=[[Peter Gelderloos]], ''Anarchy Works''<ref>Peter Gelderloos.

Engineers, scientists and software developers create [[open-source software]] projects. The [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include [[file-sharing]], [[the commons]] and [[open access]].\n\nAnarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning.

Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook</ref> Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] in his 2011 book ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' argues that with the advent of the great [[Axial Age]] civilizations the nexus between coinage and the calculability of economic values was concomitant with the disrupt of what Graeber calls \"human economies\" as found among the [[Iroquois]], [[Celts]], [[Inuit]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] among other groups, which according to Graeber held a radically different conception of debt and social relations based on the radical incalculability of human life and the constant creation and recreation of social bonds through gifts, marriages and general sociability.\n\nThe author postulates the growth of a \"military-coinage-slave complex\" around this time, through which mercenary armies looted cities and human beings were cut from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome and elsewhere in the Eurasian continent. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India and the Mediterranean was in this way connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers, together with the obligation enforced by the state for its subjects to pay its taxes in currency. This was also the same time that the great religions spread out and the general questions of philosophical enquiry emerged on world history\u2014many of those directly related, as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', with the nature of debt and its relation to ethics.\n\n==== Free shops ====\n{{main|Give away shop}}\n[[File:Give away shop utrecht inside.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside [[Utrecht]] [[Giveaway shop]], where the banner reads: \"The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed\"]]\nGive-away shops, freeshops, or free stores are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items\u2014only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a monetary framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy.\n\nThe anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[The Diggers]]<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112\u2013}}</ref> opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.<ref name=\"Lytle_2006_213215\">{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.</ref> The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]<ref name=\"Digger Archives\">{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}</ref> and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].<ref name=\"American Experience doc\">{{cite video|people=[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco|date=2007|title=American Experience: The Summer of Love|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>\n\nAlthough free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.\n\n==== Peer-to-peer (P2P) ====\n{{main|Infoanarchism|Digital commons (economics)|Social peer-to-peer processes|Knowledge commons}}\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) is not restricted to technology, but covers every social process with a peer-to-peer dynamic, whether these peers are humans or computers. [[Peer-to-peer]] as a term originated from the popular concept of P2P distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.\n\nThe concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option. Anarchist scholar [[Uri Gordon]] has said that \"the collaborative development of [[free software]] like the [[Linux]] operating system and applications such as [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] clearly approximate an informational anarchist communism. Moreover, for anarchists it is precisely the logic of [[expropriation]] and [[Copyright infringement|electronic piracy]] that enables a radical political extension of the cultural ideals of the free manipulation, circulation and use of information associated with the \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] ethic\" (Himanen 2001). The space of illegality created by [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing]] opens up the possibility, not only of the open circulation of freely-given information and software as it is on the Internet today, but also of conscious copyright violation. The Internet, then, enables not only communist relations around information, but also the militant contamination and erosion of non-communist regimes of knowledge\u2014a technological \"weapon\" to equalise access to information, eating away at intellectual property rights by rendering them unenforceable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/uri-gordon-anarchism-and-political-theory-contemporary-problems|author=[[Uri Gordon]]|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=Aug 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nP2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision-making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network. There are three fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:\n# [[Peer production]]: the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |title=Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm |first=Yochai |last=Benkler |publisher=The Yale Law Journal |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-10 }}</ref>\n# Peer governance: production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy.\n# Peer property: the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).\n\nPeer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive\u2014its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly as possible.\n\nWhile many anarcho-communists are opposed to trade, some post-left, post-scarcity anarcho-communists and ones with syndicalist sympathies are not opposed to trade. Some support a non-monetary form of trade in the form of post-monetary [[trade unions]] and [[commons]]. Others such as Tiziana Terranova easily see anarcho-communism being compatible with a non-hierarchical, open access, free association, post-monetary form of trade such as [[peer-to-peer (meme)|P2P]].<ref>Terranova, Tiziana [http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary \"Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy\"]. 07-26-2005</ref>\n\n=== Coexistence of economic systems and economic pluralism ===\n{{see also|Anarchism without adjectives}}\nFrench [[anarchist without adjectives]] [[Max Nettlau]] addressed the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems as follows: {{quote|Let me imagine myself for a moment living in a free society. I should certainly have different occupations, manual and mental, requiring strength or skill. It would be very monotonous if the three or four groups with whom I would work (for I hope there will be no Syndicates then!) would be organized on exactly the same lines; I rather think that different degrees or forms of Communism will prevail in them. But might I not become tired of this, and wish for a spell of relative isolation, of Individualism? So I might turn to one of the many possible forms of \"equal exchange\" Individualism. Perhaps people will do one thing when they are young and another thing when they grow older. Those who are but indifferent workers may continue with their groups; those who are efficient will lose patience at always working with beginners and will go ahead by themselves, unless a very altruist disposition makes it a pleasure to them to act as teachers or advisers to younger people. I also think that at the beginning I should adopt Communism with friends and Individualism with strangers, and shape my future life according to experience. Thus, a free and easy change from one variety of Communism to another, thence to any variety of Individualism, and so on, would be the most obvious and elementary thing in a really free society; and if any group of people tried to check this, to make one system predominant, they would be as bitterly fought as revolutionists fight the present system.<ref>Max Nettlau.

[[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports the following:\n:\"Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called \"[[affinity group]]s.\" There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, \"unsuited to industrialization.\" As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Commune, federalism and economic democracy ===\n{{main|Economic democracy|Commune|Federalism#Federalism as the anarchist and libertarian socialist mode of political organization|Libertarian municipalism|Socialization (economics)|Communisation}}\nAnarcho-communism has been critical of a simple call for worker's ownership of workplaces and their administration as cooperatives. [[Murray Bookchin]] has put it this way \"what of the [[Revolutionary syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideal of \"collectivized\" self-managed enterprises that are coordinated by like occupations on a national level and coordinated geographically by \"collectives\" on a local level?...Here, the traditional socialist criticism of this syndicalist form of economic management is not without its point: the corporate or private capitalist, \"worker-controlled\" or not \u2013 ironically, a technique in the repertoire of industrial management that is coming very much into vogue today as \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership\" and constitutes no threat whatever to private property and capitalism...In any case, \"economic democracy\" has not simply meant \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership.\" Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply \"participate\" in \"planning\" their own misery. What \"[[economic democracy]]\" meant in its profoundest sense was free, \"democratic\" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want. It is a dirty bourgeois trick, in which many radicals unknowingly participate, that \"economic democracy\" has been re-interpreted as \"employee ownership\" and \"workplace democracy\" and has come to mean workers' \"participation\" in profit sharing and industrial management rather than freedom from the tyranny of the factory, rationalized labor, and \"planned production\", which is usually exploitative production with the complicity of the workers\".<ref name=Bookchin>[http://libcom.org/library/municipalization-murray-bookchin \"Municipalization: Community Ownership of the Economy\"] by Murray Bookchin</ref>\n\nA common call within anarchism is for a [[Federalism#Federalism as the Anarchist Mode of Political Organization|confederal]] form in relationships of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] and [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] between communes as an alternative to the [[centralism]] of the [[nation-state]]. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested: \"Representative government has accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life \u2013 private property \u2013 without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered as attributes of the State\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles|title=Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and Principles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs such, \"no community can hope to achieve economic autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become self-enclosed and parochial, not only \"self-sufficient.\" Hence the confederation of communes\u2014the Commune of communes\u2014is reworked economically as well as politically into a shared universe of publicly managed resources. The management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to speak of self-serving bourgeois \"cooperatives\", it is through a municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well\".<ref name=Bookchin />\n\nEconomic democracy as proposed by [[Takis Fotopoulos]]<ref>\"This leads to the proposal for a new conception of social welfare \u2013 the third aim of the paper \u2013 which is based on a conception of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy.\"[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol5/fotopoulos_welfare.htm Welfare State or Economic Democracy?] by Takis Fotopoulos</ref> and Bookchin<ref>\"In any case, \"economic democracy\" has not simply meant \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership.\" Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply \"participate\" in \"planning\" their own misery.

The collectives were formed under the influence of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Trade union|union]] (the CNT) in rural and urban areas and successfully practised [[workers' self-management]] and [[collectivist anarchism]] for a number of years in extremely difficult economic and political circumstances. Other examples of self-management include the factory committee movement during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the workplace occupations in Argentina during its crisis at the turn of the 21st century. Attempts at forming co-operatives also appeared during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and the [[Biennio Rosso|Italian factory occupations of 1920]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Autonomism]]\n* [[Community-based economics]]\n* [[Decentrally planned economy]]\n* [[Distributism]]\n* [[Gandhian economics]]\n* [[Political economy]]\n* [[Prosumer]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further research ==\n=== Anarchist economics bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author1=Michael Albert|author2=Robin Hahnel|title=A Quiet Revolution in Welfare Economics|url=https://zcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/zbooks/www/books/quiet.htm|authorlink1=Michael Albert|authorlink2=Robin Hahnel}}\n* [[Michael Albert|Albert, Michael]], ''Parecon: Life After Capitalism'' (W.

In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour\", rather it is \"interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the \u2013 subject labourers\".<ref name=\"Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin\">{{cite web|author=Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin|url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ|publisher=Infoshop.org|accessdate=2010-09-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6|archivedate=2010-11-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]\n[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.<ref name=\"Woodcock, George p. 100\">Woodcock, George.

What is Mutualism?</ref> Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests as well as the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few.\n\nProudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. He thus saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\n[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josiah Warren]]]]\n[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchist]]<ref name=Slate>Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''</ref> and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published.<ref name=\"bailie20\">William Bailie, [http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist \u2013 A Sociological Study''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204155505/http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |date=February 4, 2012 }}, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20</ref> Warren termed the phrase \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\", with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">\"A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''.

Cafiero explains in ''[[Anarchy and Communism]]'' (1880) that private property in the product of labor will lead to unequal [[accumulation of capital]] and therefore the reappearance of [[social class]]es and their antagonisms; and thus the resurrection of the state: \"If we preserve the individual appropriation of the products of labour, we would be forced to preserve money, leaving more or less accumulation of wealth according to more or less merit rather than need of individuals\".<ref name=\"Graham-2005\">Robert Graham, ''Anarchism \u2013 A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas \u2013 Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005</ref> At the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International in 1876, held in a forest outside [[Florence]] due to [[police]] activity, they declared the principles of anarcho-communism.\n\n=== Anarchism economics in practice: the Spanish Revolution ===\n{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Anarchist Catalonia}}\nIn the strong [[anarchism in Spain|anarchist movement in Spain]], the debate between collectivism and anarcho-communism was revived: \"This double base, both industrial and rural, had turned the [[libertarian communism]] of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] in somewhat divergent directions, the one communalist, the other syndicalist.

A section of them had given their hearts to Peter Kropotkin and his erudite yet simplistic idealization of the [[commune]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] which they identified with the Spanish tradition of the primitive peasant community. Their favorite slogan was the \"free commune\". Mikhail Bakunin was the founder of the Spanish collectivist, syndicalist and internationalist workers' movement. Those anarchists tended to follow him and his disciple [[Ricardo Mella]].<ref name=\"libcom1970\"/> They were concerned with economic unification and believed that a long transitional period would be necessary during which it would be wiser to reward labor according to the hours worked and not according to need.

The landlords in the villages had fled, the Civil Guards had been killed or chased away, and the village syndicate would transform itself into a popular assembly in which every villager could participate directly in the affairs of the community. An administrative committee would be elected, but this would operate under the constant supervision of the population, meeting at least once a week in full assembly to hasten the achievement of free communism. In the factories the process was similar, with a workers' committee becoming responsible to the general assembly of the syndicate, and technicians (in a few cases the former owners or managers) planning production in accordance with the workers' views.<ref name=\"autogenerated1962\"/>\n\n== Theoretical economic systems ==\n=== Classical theoretical economic systems ===\nIn a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical\u2014those created throughout the 19th century\u2014and post-classical anarchist schools\u2013those created since the mid-20th century and after.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with [[trade]] representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

[[Charles Fourier]] first used the French term ''mutualisme'' in 1822,<ref>Fourier, Charles, ''Trait\u00e9'' (1822), cited in Arthur E.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.<ref name=\"Woodcock, George p. 100\"/>\n\nIn ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that \"[t]he word \"mutualism\" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> When John Gray's 1825 ''Lecture on Human Happiness'' was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the ''Preamble and Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests'', located at Valley Forge. 1826 also saw the publication of the ''Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests'' at [[Kendal, Ohio]].\n\nBy 1846, Proudhon was speaking of ''mutualit\u00e9'' in his writings and used the term ''mutuellisme'' at least as early as 1848 in his \"Programme R\u00e9volutionnaire\". In 1850, [[William Batchelder Greene]] used the term \"mutualism\" to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. Also in 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a \"mutualist township\" by Joshua King Ingalls<ref>Joshua King Ingalls, \"A Practical Movement for Transition\", Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202\u201304.</ref> and Albert Brisbane,<ref>Albert Brisbane, \"The Mutualist Township\", The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179\u201383.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200\u201302.</ref> together with works by Proudhon,<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \"The Coming Era of Mutualism\", ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107\u201308.</ref> Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]] and others.\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent...that [[Proudhonian]] Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the [[Individualist anarchism|Individualist Anarchism]] of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...William B.

Mutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in Owenite circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the Time Store of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and individualist anarchist Josiah Warren. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with William Batchelder Greene, but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]] and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.\n\nMutualists argue that [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|association]] is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other; and without association, they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave. An operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form, and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs, etc.\n\nMutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist and author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Kevin Carson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415135834/http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=2011-04-15}}.

Mikhail Bakunin wrote that \"we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism\", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian (\"Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism\", 1867).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\nThe dispute between Bakunin and Marx highlighted the differences between anarchism and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued\u2014against certain ideas of a number of Marxists\u2014that not all revolutions need be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\", a concept that [[Vanguardism|vanguardist socialism]] including [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] would use to justify [[one-party rule]] from above by a party claiming to represent the [[proletariat]].<ref name=GW158>Woodcock, George (1962, 1975).

As such, \"[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the [[lumpenproletariat]] (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/marxism-and-anarchism-the-philosophical-roots-of-the-marx-bakunin-conflict/|title=Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict - WorkersCompass.org - Published by Workers Action|date=21 June 2002|publisher=}}</ref> Bakunin \"considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form \u2013 the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat\".<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. \"The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable\" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics'']</ref>\n\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that \"the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government\" in which each worker will have the \"right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting\".

''Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets'', p. 162</ref> Thus it could be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.\n\nThe ''[[An Anarchist FAQ|Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with communist anarchism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of \"money\" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, \"[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself.\"<ref>[Anarchism, p. 295]</ref> Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed.

[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html#toc24  ''What Is Communist Anarchism?'']</ref>\n\nAnarcho-communists argue that any economic system based on wage labor and private property requires a coercive state apparatus to enforce [[property rights]] and to maintain unequal economic relationships that inevitably arise from differences in wages or amount of property. They further argue that markets and systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical values to an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption and distribution. They argue that money restricts an individual's ability to consume the products of their labor by limiting their intake with prices and wages.\n\nAnarcho-communists recognize money as fundamentally quantitative in nature, rather than qualitative. They believe production should be a qualitative matter and that consumption and distribution should be self-determined by each individual without arbitrary value assigned to labor, goods and services by others. In place of a market, most anarcho-communists support a [[currency]]-less [[gift economy]] where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as \"payment\" for their production of goods and services.\n\nA gift economy does not necessarily involve an immediate return (such as with remuneration) as compensation comes in the form of whatever the person decides is of equal value to their products of labor (what is commonly called [[barter]]ing). Any limits on production and distribution would be determined by the individuals within the groups involved, rather than by capitalist owners, corporations, investors, banks or other artificial market pressures. Crucially, the abstract relationship of \"landlord\" and \"tenant\" would no longer exist as such titles are held to occur under conditional legal coercion and are not absolutely necessary to occupy buildings or spaces ([[intellectual property]] rights would also cease since they are a form of private property).\n\n===== Evolution and role in early 20th century revolutions =====\n[[File:La conqu\u00eate du pain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, an influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\nAnarcho-communism developed out of radical [[Socialism|socialist]] currents after the [[French Revolution]],<ref name=\"Graham-2005\" /><ref>[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__The_Great_French_Revolution_1789-1793.html#toc42 \"Chapter 41: The \"Anarchists\"\" in ''The Great French Revolution 1789\u20131793'' by Peter Kropotkin]</ref> but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111\u201313\">Nunzio Pernicone, \"Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892\", pp. 111\u201313, AK Press 2009.</ref> An early anarcho-communist was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]], the first person to describe himself as \"[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]\".<ref name=\"Dejacque\"/> Unlike Proudhon, he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\".<ref name=\"Graham-2005\" /><ref name=\"joseph.dejacque.free.fr\"/>\n\nAnarcho-communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]] by [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], Errico Malatesta, [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex Mazzinian republicans.<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111\u201313\"/> Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/> The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to extend the concept of collective ownership to the products of labor as well.\n\nWhile both groups argued against capitalism, the anarchist communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. As Malatesta put it, \"instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common.

Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist [[market economy|market economies]] and also an alternative to [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[socialism]], it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\"<ref>Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016053719/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm |date=October 16, 2008 }} Chapter 19 Individuals / Society</ref> and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers.\n\nThe underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[social solidarity|solidarity]], diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency (efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:\n* [[Workers' council|Workers']] and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making\n* [[Balanced job complex]]es\n* [[Remuneration]] according to effort and sacrifice\n* [[Parecon#Participatory planning|Participatory planning]]\n\nAlbert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of [[politics]], [[culture]] and [[kinship]]. The authors have also discussed elements of anarchism in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture and [[feminism]] in the field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. [[Stephen R. Shalom]] has begun work on a participatory political vision he calls \"[[participatory politics|parpolity]]\".\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\nAccording to the Inclusive Democracy (ID) project, economic democracy is the authority of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] (community) in the economic sphere, which requires equal distribution of economic power. As with the case of [[direct democracy]], [[economic democracy]] today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the demos. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power: capitalist and \"socialist\" [[Economic growth|growth]] economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as [[workers' control]] and milder versions suggested by [[post-Keynesian]] [[Social democracy|social democrats]]. The demos therefore becomes the authentic unit of economic life.\n\nThe main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of: (a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens\u2014which requires that basic macro-economic decisions have to be made democratically; and (b) securing freedom of choice\u2014which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume and so on).\n\nTherefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly; and (2) an artificial market using personal vouchers, which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]], but it avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system \"a form of money based on the labour theory of value\",<ref>David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996, p. 321</ref> it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, parecon guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only to the extent they are characterized public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.<ref>Michael Albert, ''[http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231141221/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm |date=2009-12-31 }}'', Verso Books, 2003, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\n==== Free-market anarchism ====\n{{main|Free-market anarchism}}\n{{see also|Anarcho-capitalism|Left-wing market anarchism}}\n{{further|Anarchism and capitalism}}\nFree-market anarchism, based on the economic theories of mutualism and individualist anarchism, is a revival of such free-market anarchist theories.<ref>Zwolinski, Matt (9 January 2013).

Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human.

From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralised, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population. Capitalism was born under such states and as well as backing fascist movements, they made high profits in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Today many corporations \"regularly do business with totalitarian and authoritarian regimes \u2013 again, because it is profitable to do so.\" Indeed, there is a \"trend by US corporations to invest in\" such countries...

In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour\", rather it is \"interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the \u2013 subject labourers\".<ref name=\"Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin\"/> [[French anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests as well as the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] sees \"capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State\".<ref name=\"Igualada\">\"el capitalismo es s\u00f3lo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo \u00fanico que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida.

However, Warren reached different conclusions as he believed that goods and services should trade according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to how individuals believed them to be [[subjective theory of value|subjectively worth]]. Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\".<ref name=Slate/> To charge more labor for something that entailed less labor was \"cannibalism\", according to him.<ref>\"If a priest is required to get a soul out of purgatory, he sets his price according to the value which the relatives set upon his prayers, instead of their cost to the priest. This, again, is cannibalism. The same amount of labor equally disagreeable, with equal wear and tear, performed by his customers, would be a just remuneration\". Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''</ref> Moreover, he believed that trading according to \"cost the limit of price\" would promote increasing efficiency in an economy, as he explains in ''Equitable Commerce'': {{quote|text=If cost is made the limit of price, every one becomes interested in reducing COST, by bringing in all the economies, all the facilities to their aid. But, on the contrary, if cost does not govern the price, but every thing is priced at what it will bring, there are no such co-operating interests.\n\nIf I am to have my supply of flour at cost, then, any facility I can afford to the wheat grower, reduces the cost to me, and it does the same for all who have any portion of the wheat, I am promoting all their interests while pursuing my own...Now if the wheat were NOT TO BE SOLD TO us AT COST, but at \"whatever it would bring\" according to our necessities, then none of us would have any interest in affording facilities, repairing breaches, nor in any other way co-operating with the producer of it. The same motive would act in the production, preservation, and use of every thing.\"<ref>Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''. pp. 77\u201378.</ref>}}\n\nHe put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store at the corner of 5th and Elm Streets in what is now downtown Cincinnati, where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor: \"All the goods offered for sale in Warren's store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them, plus a small surcharge, in the neighborhood of 4 to 7 percent, to cover store overhead\".<ref name=Mises>Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-02-25) [https://mises.org/daily/5067/Josiah-Warren-The-First-American-Anarchist Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist], ''[[Mises Institute]]''</ref> The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.<ref name=\"Charles A. Madison 1945 p. 53\"/>\n\n==== Energy credits ====\nThe theory that all values can be evaluated in terms of [[joules]]. In the same vein as the labor theory of value, this is an attempt to make a normative basis for value by accounting for [[embodied energy]]. Accounting for such a system would be vastly more complex than current or other theoretical currency systems because all energy output of workers and energy expenditure on goods/services must be tracked (something that is thought impossible and useless by many anarchists).\n\nOne group that has advocated a system using energy is the [[technocracy movement]] with a system based on [[energy accounting]] where energy is used to \"buy\" a product or service without being exchanged, so the effect is that products or services are distributed to the user without gain by the provider (who has the same amount of energy in his or her account regardless) so allegedly making profit impossible.\n\n=== Workers issues and anarcho-syndicalism ===\n{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\nAnarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism which focuses on the [[Labor rights|labour movement]].<ref>Georges Sorel in Stuart Isaacs & Chris Sparks, ''Political Theorists in Context'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 248. {{ISBN|0-415-20126-8}}</ref> ''Syndicalisme'' is a French word, ultimately derived from the Greek, meaning \"[[trade unionism]]\"\u2014hence, the \"[[syndicalism]]\" qualification. Syndicalism is an alternative [[co-operative economics|co-operative economic system]]. Adherents view it as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.\n\n[[File:Manifestaci\u00f3n CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|250px|2010 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[trade union]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]\nThe basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]].

'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system, regarding it as \"[[wage slavery]]\" and state or private ownership of the [[means of production]], which they believe lead to class divisions. Not all seek to abolish money per se. [[Ralph Chaplin]] states that \"the ultimate aim of the General Strike as regards wages is to give to each producer the full product of his labor. The demand for better wages becomes revolutionary only when it is coupled with the demand that the exploitation of labor must cease\".<ref>Chaplin, Ralph, 1933, ''The General Strike for Industrial Freedom'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, anarcho-syndicalists regard the state as a profoundly anti-worker institution. They view the primary purpose of the state as being the defence of private property and therefore of economic, social and political privilege, even when such defence denies its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy which springs from it.<ref>''Anarchosyndicalism.net'': {{cite web |url=http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618075029/http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |archivedate=2013-06-18 }}</ref> In contrast to other bodies of thought ([[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] being a prime example), anarcho-syndicalists deny that there can be any kind of [[workers' state]], or a state which acts in the interests of workers, as opposed to those of the rich and powerful.

It has been variously advocated by anarchists, [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Communism|communists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and has been combined with various [[socialist economics|socialist]] and [[mixed economy]] systems. [[Workers' council]]s are a form of workers' control.\n\nFor Proudhon, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] involved creating \"industrial democracy\", a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic\".<ref>Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62</ref> He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". This would result in \"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\".<ref>''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277,  281</ref> Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.[[Council communism]], such as in the early Soviet Union advocated workers' control through workers councils and [[factory committee]]s. [[Syndicalism]] advocates workers' control through [[trade unions]]. [[Guild socialism]] advocates workers' control through a revival of the [[guild]] system. [[Participatory economics]] represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.\n\nWorkers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state such as [[nationalisation]] and [[central planning]] (see [[state socialism]]) and private control of the means of production as found in capitalism. A worker cooperative is a [[cooperative]] owned and democratically managed by its worker-owners. This control may be exercised in a number of ways. A cooperative enterprise may mean a firm where every worker-owner participates in [[decision making]] in a democratic fashion, or it may refer to one in which managers and administration is elected by every worker-owner and finally it can refer to a situation in which managers are considered and treated as, workers of the firm.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk\">[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/57/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2009) \"Cooperative Social Enterprises: Company Rules, Access to Finance and Management Practice\", ''Social Enterprise Journal'', 5(1), forthcoming]</ref>\n\nIn traditional forms of worker cooperative, all shares are held by the workforce with no outside or consumer owners and each member has one voting share. In practice, control by worker owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis).<ref name=\"digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk\"/> A worker cooperative therefore has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce own shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce.<ref name=\"ICA\">[http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/live/images/cme_resources/Public/governance/Worker%20co-op%20governance/ICA.pdf ICA (2005) World Declaration on Worker Cooperatives, Approved by the ICA General Assembly in Cartagena, Colombia, 23 September 2005].</ref>\n\nNevertheless, anarcho-communism has been critical of workers ownership of large means of production for the following reasons: \"Whereas the syndicalist alternative re-privatizes the economy into \"self-managed\" collectives and opens the way to their degeneration into traditional forms of private property \u2013 whether \"collectively\" owned or not \u2013 [[libertarian municipalism]] politicizes the economy and dissolves it into the civic domain. Neither factory or land appear as separate interests within the communal collective. Nor can workers, farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals, and the like perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies. \"Property\" is integrated into the commune as a material constituent of its libertarian institutional framework, indeed as a part of a larger whole that is controlled by the citizen body in assembly as citizens \u2013 not as vocationally oriented interest groups\".<ref name=Bookchin />\n\n=== Forms of exchange ===\nAnarchist economist Kevin Carson manifests that \"[l]ocal currencies, barter networks and mutual credit\u2010clearing systems are a solution to a basic problem: a world in which there is a lot of work to be done, but there is simply no money around to bring the people and the work together\".<ref>Kevin Carson. ''The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low\u2010Overhead Manifesto''. BOOSURGE. 2010. p. 274</ref>\n\n==== Alternate currency ====\n{{main|alternative currency}}\nAn alternative currency is any [[currency]] used as an alternative to the dominant national or multinational currency systems (usually referred to as national or [[Fiat currency|fiat money]]). Alternative currencies can be created by an individual, corporation, or organization, they can be created by national, state, or local governments, or they can arise naturally as people begin to use a certain commodity as a currency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency.\n\nWhen used in combination with or when designed to work in combination with national or multinational fiat currencies they can be referred to as [[complementary currency]]. Most complementary currencies are also [[local currency|local currencies]] and are limited to a certain region. Barters are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which only trade items; thus without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[local exchange trading system]] is a special form of barter which trades points for items. One point stands for one man-hour of work and often there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country as some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==== Labor notes and local exchange trading systems ====\n{{main|Labor notes (currency)|Local exchange trading system}}\nLabour notes are an [[alternative currency]] based on exchange of hours of labor. Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Josiah Warren termed the phrase \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\", with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with labour notes indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\".<ref name=Slate/>\n\nHe put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]].\n\nA local exchange trading system (also local employment and trading system or local energy transfer system; abbreviated to LETS or LETSystem) is a locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprise that provides a community information service and record transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using the currency of locally created LETS Credits.<ref name=trainingpack>\"LETSystems Training Pack\", (1990) W.A. Government.</ref> LETS networks use [[interest]]-free [[community-based economics|local]] [[credit (accounting)|credit]] so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.\n\n=== Credit and banking ===\n{{main|Mutual credit|free banking}}\n[[File:Wbg-masonicportrait.png|thumb|[[William Batchelder Greene]], [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchist]] activist and theorist for [[free banking]]]]\nAnarchist mutualists argued that free banking should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[mutual savings bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Batchelder Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are LETS and the [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple monetary system]] project.\n\nIn a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, which was turned down by the legislature.<ref>Anderson, Edwin Robert. 1911.

Economists in Parliament in the Liberal Age. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 123</ref> In his debates with Bastiat, Proudhon did once propose funding a national bank with a voluntary tax of 1%.<ref>\"Suppose that all the producers in the republic, numbering more than ten millions, tax themselves, each one, to the amount of only one per cent of their capital... . Suppose that by means of this tax a bank be founded, in Competition with the Bank (miscalled) of France, discounting and giving credit on mortgages at the rate of one-half of one per cent.\" Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. pp 118\u201319.</ref> Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.<ref>Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. p 46.</ref>\n\nAmerican mutualist William Batchelder Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system. In 1850 and 1851, he organized citizens of Brookfield, Warren and Ware, [[Massachusetts]], to petition the state's General Court for a charter to establish a [[mutual savings bank|mutual bank]]: \"Upon all the petitions, the Committee on Banks and Banking, after hearing the arguments of the petitioners, reported simply, \"Leave to withdraw!\" (''The Radical Deficiency of the Existing Circulating Medium'' 1857). Similar attempts by the New England Labor Reform League in the 1870s met with similar results. Greene's mutualist banking ideas resembled those of Proudhon as well as the \"land banks\" of the colonial period. He had an important influence on Benjamin Tucker, the editor of the anarchist journal ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]''.\n\nDuring the episode known as the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], contemporary anarchist theorist [[Peter Gelderloos]] reports the following: {{cquote|[...] For better or worse, the Spanish revolutionaries also experimented with Peasant Banks, Labor Banks, and Councils of Credit and Exchange. The Levant Federation of Peasant Collectives started a bank organized by the Bank Workers Union to help farmers draw from a broad pool of social resources needed for certain infrastructure- or resource-intensive types of farming. The Central Labor Bank of Barcelona moved credit from more prosperous collectives to socially useful collectives in need. Cash transactions were kept to a minimum, and credit was transferred as credit. The Labor Bank also arranged foreign exchange, and importation and purchase of raw materials. Where possible, payment was made in commodities, not in cash. The bank was not a for-profit enterprise; it charged only 1% interest to defray expenses. [[Diego Abad de Santillan]], the anarchist economist, said in 1936: \"Credit will be a social function and not a private speculation or usury... Credit will be based on the economic possibilities of society and not on interests or profit... The Council of Credit and Exchange will be like a thermometer of the products and needs of the country.\"[52] In this experiment, money functioned as a symbol of social support and not as a symbol of ownership  \u2013  it signified resources being transferred between unions of producers rather than investments by speculators. Within a complex industrial economy such banks make exchange and production more efficient, though they also present the risk of centralization or the reemergence of capital as a social force. Furthermore, efficient production and exchange as a value should be viewed with suspicion, at the least, by people interested in liberation. There are a number of methods that could prevent institutions such as labor banks from facilitating the return of capitalism, though unfortunately the onslaught of totalitarianism from both the fascists and Communists deprived Spanish anarchists of the chance to develop them. These might include rotating and mixing tasks to prevent the emergence of a new managing class, developing fragmented structures that cannot be controlled at a central or national level, promoting as much decentralization and simplicity as possible, and maintaining a firm tradition that common resources and instruments of social wealth are never for sale.|author=[[Peter Gelderloos]], ''Anarchy Works''<ref>Peter Gelderloos.

Engineers, scientists and software developers create [[open-source software]] projects. The [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include [[file-sharing]], [[the commons]] and [[open access]].\n\nAnarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to [[Peter Kropotkin]], who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of \"[[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]\".<ref>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by Ashley Montagu, and The Struggle for Existence, by Thomas H.

Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook</ref> Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] in his 2011 book ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' argues that with the advent of the great [[Axial Age]] civilizations the nexus between coinage and the calculability of economic values was concomitant with the disrupt of what Graeber calls \"human economies\" as found among the [[Iroquois]], [[Celts]], [[Inuit]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] among other groups, which according to Graeber held a radically different conception of debt and social relations based on the radical incalculability of human life and the constant creation and recreation of social bonds through gifts, marriages and general sociability.\n\nThe author postulates the growth of a \"military-coinage-slave complex\" around this time, through which mercenary armies looted cities and human beings were cut from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome and elsewhere in the Eurasian continent. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India and the Mediterranean was in this way connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers, together with the obligation enforced by the state for its subjects to pay its taxes in currency. This was also the same time that the great religions spread out and the general questions of philosophical enquiry emerged on world history\u2014many of those directly related, as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', with the nature of debt and its relation to ethics.\n\n==== Free shops ====\n{{main|Give away shop}}\n[[File:Give away shop utrecht inside.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside [[Utrecht]] [[Giveaway shop]], where the banner reads: \"The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed\"]]\nGive-away shops, freeshops, or free stores are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items\u2014only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out type policy (swap shops).

Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.\n\n==== Peer-to-peer (P2P) ====\n{{main|Infoanarchism|Digital commons (economics)|Social peer-to-peer processes|Knowledge commons}}\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) is not restricted to technology, but covers every social process with a peer-to-peer dynamic, whether these peers are humans or computers. [[Peer-to-peer]] as a term originated from the popular concept of P2P distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.\n\nThe concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option. Anarchist scholar [[Uri Gordon]] has said that \"the collaborative development of [[free software]] like the [[Linux]] operating system and applications such as [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] clearly approximate an informational anarchist communism. Moreover, for anarchists it is precisely the logic of [[expropriation]] and [[Copyright infringement|electronic piracy]] that enables a radical political extension of the cultural ideals of the free manipulation, circulation and use of information associated with the \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] ethic\" (Himanen 2001). The space of illegality created by [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing]] opens up the possibility, not only of the open circulation of freely-given information and software as it is on the Internet today, but also of conscious copyright violation. The Internet, then, enables not only communist relations around information, but also the militant contamination and erosion of non-communist regimes of knowledge\u2014a technological \"weapon\" to equalise access to information, eating away at intellectual property rights by rendering them unenforceable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/uri-gordon-anarchism-and-political-theory-contemporary-problems|author=[[Uri Gordon]]|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=Aug 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nP2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision-making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network. There are three fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:\n# [[Peer production]]: the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |title=Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm |first=Yochai |last=Benkler |publisher=The Yale Law Journal |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-10 }}</ref>\n# Peer governance: production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy.\n# Peer property: the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).\n\nPeer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive\u2014its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly as possible.\n\nWhile many anarcho-communists are opposed to trade, some post-left, post-scarcity anarcho-communists and ones with syndicalist sympathies are not opposed to trade. Some support a non-monetary form of trade in the form of post-monetary [[trade unions]] and [[commons]]. Others such as Tiziana Terranova easily see anarcho-communism being compatible with a non-hierarchical, open access, free association, post-monetary form of trade such as [[peer-to-peer (meme)|P2P]].<ref>Terranova, Tiziana [http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary \"Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy\"]. 07-26-2005</ref>\n\n=== Coexistence of economic systems and economic pluralism ===\n{{see also|Anarchism without adjectives}}\nFrench [[anarchist without adjectives]] [[Max Nettlau]] addressed the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems as follows: {{quote|Let me imagine myself for a moment living in a free society. I should certainly have different occupations, manual and mental, requiring strength or skill. It would be very monotonous if the three or four groups with whom I would work (for I hope there will be no Syndicates then!) would be organized on exactly the same lines; I rather think that different degrees or forms of Communism will prevail in them. But might I not become tired of this, and wish for a spell of relative isolation, of Individualism? So I might turn to one of the many possible forms of \"equal exchange\" Individualism. Perhaps people will do one thing when they are young and another thing when they grow older. Those who are but indifferent workers may continue with their groups; those who are efficient will lose patience at always working with beginners and will go ahead by themselves, unless a very altruist disposition makes it a pleasure to them to act as teachers or advisers to younger people. I also think that at the beginning I should adopt Communism with friends and Individualism with strangers, and shape my future life according to experience. Thus, a free and easy change from one variety of Communism to another, thence to any variety of Individualism, and so on, would be the most obvious and elementary thing in a really free society; and if any group of people tried to check this, to make one system predominant, they would be as bitterly fought as revolutionists fight the present system.<ref>Max Nettlau.

Here, [[Gift economy|gift]] and barter \u2013 one product for another; there, exchange \u2013 product for representative value.

[[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports the following:\n:\"Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called \"[[affinity group]]s.\" There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, \"unsuited to industrialization.\" As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Commune, federalism and economic democracy ===\n{{main|Economic democracy|Commune|Federalism#Federalism as the anarchist and libertarian socialist mode of political organization|Libertarian municipalism|Socialization (economics)|Communisation}}\nAnarcho-communism has been critical of a simple call for worker's ownership of workplaces and their administration as cooperatives. [[Murray Bookchin]] has put it this way \"what of the [[Revolutionary syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideal of \"collectivized\" self-managed enterprises that are coordinated by like occupations on a national level and coordinated geographically by \"collectives\" on a local level?...Here, the traditional socialist criticism of this syndicalist form of economic management is not without its point: the corporate or private capitalist, \"worker-controlled\" or not \u2013 ironically, a technique in the repertoire of industrial management that is coming very much into vogue today as \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership\" and constitutes no threat whatever to private property and capitalism...In any case, \"economic democracy\" has not simply meant \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership.\" Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply \"participate\" in \"planning\" their own misery. What \"[[economic democracy]]\" meant in its profoundest sense was free, \"democratic\" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want. It is a dirty bourgeois trick, in which many radicals unknowingly participate, that \"economic democracy\" has been re-interpreted as \"employee ownership\" and \"workplace democracy\" and has come to mean workers' \"participation\" in profit sharing and industrial management rather than freedom from the tyranny of the factory, rationalized labor, and \"planned production\", which is usually exploitative production with the complicity of the workers\".<ref name=Bookchin>[http://libcom.org/library/municipalization-murray-bookchin \"Municipalization: Community Ownership of the Economy\"] by Murray Bookchin</ref>\n\nA common call within anarchism is for a [[Federalism#Federalism as the Anarchist Mode of Political Organization|confederal]] form in relationships of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] and [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] between communes as an alternative to the [[centralism]] of the [[nation-state]]. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested: \"Representative government has accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life \u2013 private property \u2013 without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered as attributes of the State\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles|title=Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and Principles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs such, \"no community can hope to achieve economic autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become self-enclosed and parochial, not only \"self-sufficient.\" Hence the confederation of communes\u2014the Commune of communes\u2014is reworked economically as well as politically into a shared universe of publicly managed resources. The management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to speak of self-serving bourgeois \"cooperatives\", it is through a municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well\".<ref name=Bookchin />\n\nEconomic democracy as proposed by [[Takis Fotopoulos]]<ref>\"This leads to the proposal for a new conception of social welfare \u2013 the third aim of the paper \u2013 which is based on a conception of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy.\"[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol5/fotopoulos_welfare.htm Welfare State or Economic Democracy?] by Takis Fotopoulos</ref> and Bookchin<ref>\"In any case, \"economic democracy\" has not simply meant \"workplace democracy\" and \"employee ownership.\" Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply \"participate\" in \"planning\" their own misery.

Another example of individual anarchists attempting to put their economic theories into action was the [[Cincinnati Time Store]], where [[labor notes (currency)|labor notes]] were redeemable for goods.\n\nThe anarchist collectives formed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] are the most famous example of an anarchist economy operating on a large scale. The collectives were formed under the influence of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Trade union|union]] (the CNT) in rural and urban areas and successfully practised [[workers' self-management]] and [[collectivist anarchism]] for a number of years in extremely difficult economic and political circumstances. Other examples of self-management include the factory committee movement during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the workplace occupations in Argentina during its crisis at the turn of the 21st century.

In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987.

Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].
