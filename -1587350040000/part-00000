He graduated from the [[University of Paris]]-the Sorbonne in 1967, completing a higher doctorate (\u2033th\u00e8se d\u2032Etat\u2033) prepared under the direction of [[Jacques-Louis Lions]]. He published over 400 articles which appeared in major scientific journals, as well as 12 (authored or co-authored) books some of which have been translated  in different languages, including English (from French), Russian, and Chinese. Three of his books are now published in permanent series (5 -7).\n\n==Scientific work ==\nThe scientific work of Roger Temam, which is at the interface between mathematical analysis, numerical analysis and scientific computing, includes mathematical modeling and analysis, as well as the development of novel numerical methods. The first work of Roger Temam in his thesis dealt with the fractional steps method. Thereafter, he has continually explored and developed new directions and techniques:\n* calculus of variations, and, more precisely, the notion of duality, developing the mathematical framework for discontinuous (in displacement) solutions; a concept later used for his works on the mathematical theory of plasticity;\n* mathematical formulation of the equilibrium of a plasma in a cavity, expressed as a nonlinear Free Boundary Value Problem;\n* [[Korteweg-de Vries equation]];\n* [[Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation]];\n* [[Euler equations]] in a bounded domain;\n* infinite-dimensional dynamical systems theory. In particular, he studied  the existence of the finite-dimensional global attractor for many dissipative equations of mathematical physics, including the incompressible [[Navier-Stokes equations]], for which he obtained, with [[Peter Constantin]], [[Ciprian Foias]] and [[Oscar Manley]], a physically relevant almost sharp upper bound on the dimension of the global attractor. He was also the co-founder of the notion of inertial manifolds together with Ciprian Foias and [[George R. Sell]] and of exponential attractors together with [[Alp Eden]], Ciprian Foias and [[Basil Nicolaenko]];\n* optimal control of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as a tool for the control of turbulence;\n* boundary layer phenomena for incompressible flows.\n\nThe main activities of Roger Temam nowadays concern the study of geophysical flows, the atmosphere and oceans. This started in the 1990s by collaboration with Jacques-Louis Lions and [[Shouhong Wang]].\n\nThe influence of Roger Temam in the development of applied mathematics in France, as well as all over the world, has been substantial. His scientific influence can also be measured in the number of doctoral theses that he has supervised, both in France and in the United States.  According to the Mathematical Genealogy Project database, <ref>http://www.mathgenealogy.org/most-students.php?count=150</ref><ref>http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201705/rnoti-p466.pdf</ref> he holds the first position in the top 50 advisors.  More than 30 of his students are now full professors all over the world, and have themselves many descendants.<ref>[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11498 Roger Temam]</ref> \n\n==Administrative activities==\nBesides his scientific work, Roger Temam has engaged in various administrative activities. He became a professor at the University of Paris-Sud at Orsay in 1968. There, he co-founded the Laboratory of Numerical and Functional Analysis which he directed from 1972 to 1988. He was also a Ma\u00eetre de Conf\u00e9rences at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris from 1968 to 1986.\n\nIn 1983, Roger Temam co-founded the SMAI, the French Applied and Industrial Mathematical Society, analogous to SIAM, and served as its first president. He was also one of the founders of the ICIAM conference series and was the chair of the steering committee of the first ICIAM meeting held in Paris in 1987; and the chair of the standing committee of the second ICIAM meeting held in Washington DC in 1991. He was also the Editor-in-Chief of the mathematical journal M2AN from 1986 to 1997, and has served or is serving on the editorial board of such journals as Asymptotic Analysis, Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, Journal of Differential Equations, Physica D, Communications in PDEs and SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis.\n\nRoger Temam also has a very successful career in the United States. He has been the Director of the Institute for Scientific Computing & Applied Mathematics (ISCAM)<ref> http://www.indiana.edu/~iscam/</ref> at Indiana University since 1986 (co-director with C. Foias from 1986 to 1992).

The Chiru population numbers approximately 8,599. It is one of the least documented and a highly endangered language spoken in three districts of Manipur: [[Senapati district|Senapati]], [[Noney district|Noney]] district of Manipur and [[Cachar district|Cachar]] district of Assam. Chiru has been recognized as a Scheduled Tribe of Manipur by the government of India since 1956 under \"The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, Act No. 63 of 1956\" Dated 25 September 1956. The total population of the native speakers of Chiru is only 8599 (Census of India: 2011). The native speakers have high proficiency in [[Meitei language|Meitei]]. The language is neither used in schools nor in radio or mass media. Older people read and write in Manipuri written in [[Bengali (script)|Bengali script,]] but the younger generation prefers [[Roman Script|Roman script]]. \n\nThe Chirus are one of the earliest inhabitants of [[Manipur]] and [[Assam]]. Cheitharol Kumbaba, the Royal Chronicles of Manipur mentioned that King Meidingu Chalamba defeated the Chirus in 1554. This proves that the Chirus had settled in Manipur long before this period. It was also mentioned in the Royal Chronicles of Manipur that an incidence of Meitei King\u2019s incursion on Nungsai Chiru Village occurred on 22nd day of Wakching (December-January) 1729 during the reign of Maharaja Garibniwaz (Cheitharol Kumbaba: 1989:90). In spite of the considerably long period of their settlement in the two states (Manipur and Assam), the population of Chiru native speakers is shockingly very low. The growth rate of their population was extremely steady. This might be due to high mortality rate and low birth rate in the previous centuries. \n\nThe domain of language use for Chiru is very limited. The usage of Chiru by Chiru native speakers is specifically confined only at home domain and within the community among the native speakers. The language proficiency of Chiru native speakers ranges from bilingual to multilingual. The native speakers in [[Manipur]] have high proficiency in [[Manipuri (Meiteilon Language)|Manipuri]] and those in [[Assam]] have high proficiency in [[Hmar languages|Hmar]], [[Manipuri (Meiteilon Language)|Manipuri]] and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti Bengali]].

The Chiru native speakers in Manipur usually speak either [[Manipuri (Meiteilon Language)|Manipuri]] or [[Hindi]] in the market place, office etc. Moreover, they also speak Paior Thwhen they interact with, and  speakers respectively. On the other hand, Chiru speakers of Assam speak [[Sylheti language|Sylheti Bengali]], [[Manipuri (Meiteilon Language)|Manipuri]] or [[Hmar languages|Hmar]] in the market places, offices or anywhere outside home domain.

He tends to swap out the bridge pickups in some of his Stratocasters for DiMarzio HS-2 pickups, because they don't hum as much as standard single-coils. Johnson has also played other guitar brands such as [[Robin Guitars|Robin]], [[Rickenbacker]], [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], and a [[Charvel]], which appears on the cover of the ''Ah Via Musicom'' album. In 2001, Johnson added a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] ''Custom Shop '59 Les Paul Reissue'' to his collection of guitars. It is noteworthy that he no longer uses a Dumble amplifier, as he had to replace a faulty component in his favorite Dumble, the Steel String Singer. It never sounded the same afterwards, and he sold the amplifier to Carlos Santana.\n\nJohnson has had several models built by his specifications for sale in the mass market. In 2003, [[C. F. Martin & Company]] released a limited-edition ''Eric Johnson Signature MC-40'' guitar built for him. Johnson donated 5% of the guitar's sales profit to his father's college, [[Thomas Jefferson University|Jefferson Medical College]] (Now called the Thomas Jefferson University).<ref>[http://www.jeffersonhospital.org/news/2004/article8160.html \"Jefferson Medical College Students to Benefit from Generosity of Grammy-Winning Guitarist Eric Johnson\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130093736/http://www.jeffersonhospital.org/news/2004/article8160.html |date=January 30, 2006 }} \u2013 ''Thomas Jefferson University Hospital''.</ref> Johnson has also been known to use the [[Martin D-45]] before his signature Martin guitar was released.\n\nIn 2005, Fender released an ''Eric Johnson Signature Fender Stratocaster'' also built to his specifications. This was followed up by the ''Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster Rosewood'' model in 2009. It featured the same specifications as the Eric Johnson Maple Neck guitar, but with the addition of an unusual three-ply, eight-hole white pick guard, hotter treble pickup, and a bound rosewood laminate fingerboard with [[pearloid]] dot [[position marker]]s.\n\nEric generally doesn't collect guitars as he isn't interested in owning a lot of superfluous items. His collection is small and limited to the best playing examples of the guitar he finds. \n\n1967 Flying V: Traded at a show for a 30s Dobro guitar he purchased just to swap for the Flying V. \n\n1964 SG Maestro Vibrola: an instrument famously played by George Harrison on stage and during the recording of several Beatles albums. Eric Generally avoided SGs for being unable to stay in tune, but traded two Marshall amplifiers for this particular one for its ability to hold a tune extremely well. \n\n1962 Fender Stratocaster: This is the instrument stolen from his apartment in 1982. It had a Mustang pick up that Seymour Duncan had rewound himself. Found at a pawn shop 24 years later, Eric cross referenced with serial numbers he had written down, and found the pawn shop had his stolen collection of guitars. He bought it back. It has 6.5-ohm single-coil pick ups (Similar to the Seymour Duncan five two pick up available for purchase).\n\n1957 Fender Stratocaster: Bought at a show in Florida \n\nUndated early 80s Martin D45: A reissue of a pre-war design purchased for him by his father after the 1982 incident. \n\n1964 Gibson ES-335: Block inlay stop tale piece with lower output pickups. It has a ding from the photographer dropping equipment on it during the Venus Isle photo shoot. \n\n1966 Fender Bass VI: The replacement for one of the guitars stolen in the 1982 incident. Featured on Bloom \"tribute to Jerry Reed\" and \"On the Way to Love\" on Up Close and other tracks. \n\nIn March 2018, Fender released an ''Eric Johnson Signature Thinline Fender Stratocaster'' built to exactly the same specifications as his first signature Strat, the sole exception being that the guitar is a semi-hollow design, which is a rarity for Fender. The guitar is available in Vintage White and two-color Sunburst, with quarter-sawn maple necks exclusively.\n\nPrototype EJ Signature Fender Stratocasters: Eric tours with the final prototypes sent to him before production began of his signature models including the thinline, and is not using examples from the production line up available in stores. \n\nIn January 2006, a man named Brian Sparks was arrested for posing as Johnson and, in the process, defrauding businesses out of about US$18,000 worth of guitars and equipment.<ref>RedOrbit Breaking News [http://www.redorbit.com/news/oddities/348017/man_poses_as_grammy_winner_to_get_guitars/ \"Man Poses As Grammy Winner to Get Guitars\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107133724/http://www.redorbit.com/news/oddities/348017/man_poses_as_grammy_winner_to_get_guitars/ |date=January 7, 2008 }}- January 3, 2006.</ref> Also in 2006, some of Johnson's guitars that had been stolen 24 years earlier were recovered.<ref>[http://www.ernieball.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13618&highlight=Eric+Johnson+stolen+guitars \"Eric Johnson recovers stolen guitars\"] \u2013 ''ErnieBall.com'' \u2013 March 2006.</ref>\n\nJohnson has also released other signature gear such as GHS Eric Johnson Nickel Rockers Electric Guitar Strings, [[DiMarzio]] DP211 Eric Johnson Signature Custom Pickups, and a Fulton-Webb amplifier.

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/>\n\n====Chat Logs====\n\nChat logs have been studied for author profiling as they include much textual [[discourse]], the analysis of which have contributed to applicational studies including social trends and [[forensic science]].

Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). [https://www.amazon.com/Author-Trail-Don-Foster/dp/0805063579 Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous].

A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C.

Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019.

With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]]. It features a criminal profiler who identifies defining characteristics of the Unabomber\u2019s identity based on his analysis of the Unabomber\u2019s [[idiolect]] in his letters and published manifesto.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Authorship debates]]\n[[Category:Computational fields of study]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|System to identify an author}}\n'''Author profiling''' is a method of analyzing a given number of texts to try to uncover various characteristics of the [[author]] (e.g. age and gender) based on stylistic- and content-based features.<ref>\u00c1lvarez-Carmona, Miguel \u00c1., et al. \"[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6f42/f397ac6306d9da5e8e4f021b9b7df170e770.pdf Evaluating topic-based representations for author profiling in social media]\".

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]].

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest and best-known examples of the use of author profiling is by [[Roger Shuy]], who was asked to examine a ransom note linked to a notorious kidnapping case in 1979. Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef19/pan19-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Therefore, bot detection from an author profiling perspective is a task of high importance.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\"/><ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\">Goubin, R\u00e9gis & Lefeuvre, Dorian & Alhamzeh, Alaa & Mitrovi\u0107, Jelena & Egyed-Zsigmond, El\u02dd & Fossi, Leopold. (2019). Bots and Gender Profiling using a Multi-layer Architecture Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2019.</ref>\n\nMade to appear as human accounts, bots can mostly be identified by information on their profiles, like their username, profile photo and time of posting.<ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\"/> However, the task of identifying bots solely from textual data (i.e. without meta-data) is significantly more challenging, requiring author profiling techniques.<ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\"/> This usually involves a classification task based on semantic and syntactic features.<ref name=\"Daelmans 2019\">Daelemans W. et al.

Author profiling techniques are helpful to business experts in making better informed strategic decisions based on the demographics of their target group.<ref>Raghunadha Reddy T., Lakshminarayana M., Vishnu Vardhan B., Sai Prasad K., Amarnath Reddy E.

Author profiling for [[literature]] is also been done to deduce the [[social network]]s of authors and their literary influence based on their bibliographic records of co-authorship.\n\nSome examples of author profiling studies on literature and traditional media include studies on the following;:<ref>Company, J. S., & Wanner, L. (2017). On the Relevance of Syntactic and Discourse Features for Author Profiling and Identification.

(2009). Classifying library catalogues by author profiling. In: Proceedings of the 32nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR 09. {{doi|10.1145/1571941.1572057}}</ref> In this approach, author profiling techniques may improve the efficiency of [[library catalog|library cataloguing]] in which library resources are automatically classified based on the authors' [[bibliographic records]]. This was a significant issue in the early 21st century when much of library cataloguing was still done manually.\n\nIn using author profiling for library cataloguing, researchers have utilised [[machine learning]] for automatic processes in the [[library]], such as [[Support Vector Machine]] [[algorithms]] (SVMs). With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]]. It features a criminal profiler who identifies defining characteristics of the Unabomber\u2019s identity based on his analysis of the Unabomber\u2019s [[idiolect]] in his letters and published manifesto.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Authorship debates]]\n[[Category:Computational fields of study]]\n", "name_user": "LBurris89", "label": "safe", "comment": "spacing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_profiling"}

Rockhill was selected as the location of the railroad's maintenance facility. The parent company Rockhill Iron and Coal located their dual-stack [[coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired iron furnace here. Rockhill as it exists today was created by the coal company and the railroad as a support community for their infrastructure.\n\nThe iron furnace shut down for the last time in 1907, and the railroad became the primary employer.

Rockhill was selected as the location of the railroad's maintenance facility. The parent company Rockhill Iron and Coal located their dual-stack [[coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired iron furnace here. Rockhill as it exists today was created by the coal company and the railroad as a support community for their infrastructure.\n\nThe iron furnace shut down for the last time in 1907, and the railroad became the primary employer.
