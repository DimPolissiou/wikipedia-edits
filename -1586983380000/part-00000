Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.\n\nSome committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.\n\n=== Street-level image data ===\nIn addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360\u00b0 image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[OpenStreetCam]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Government data===\nSome government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, OSM uses [[Landsat 7]] satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from [[NOAA]], and [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported, while [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.\n\n[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.\n\n===Route planning===\nIn February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|accessdate = 28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.\n\n==Map usage==\n\n===Software for viewing maps===\n[[File:Soho - map 1.png|thumb|OpenStreetMap of [[Soho]], central London, shown in \"standard\" OpenStreetMap layer]]\n[[File:MapBox Streets example of a map of Soho, London.png|thumb|Same as above, shown in [[Mapbox]] Streets layer]]\n[[File:India OpenStreetMap data loading in QGIS.gif|thumb|Raw OpenStreetMap data of India loading in [[QGIS]] for analysis and mapmaking]]{{See also|Comparison of free off-line GPS software#Free maps}}\n;[[Web browser]]\n:Data provided by the OpenStreetMap project can be viewed in a [[web browser]] with [[JavaScript]] support via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) on its official website.

This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |author=Simon Poole |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |author=Harry Wood |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAll data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a [[OpenStreetmap:Copyright|set of terms]] which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.\n\nSoftware used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].<ref name=\"osm-wiki-legalfaq\" />\n\n===Commercial data contributions===\nSome OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.\n\nNotably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a [[free content license|free]] and [[open content license|open]] licence,<ref name=\"ogd-Coast1\" /> until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011.<ref name=\"yahoo-maps-close\" /> In November 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors.<ref name=\"ogd-Coast2\" /> For a period from 2009 to 2011, [[NearMap|NearMap Pty Ltd]] made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a [[CC BY-SA]] licence.<ref name=\"nearmap\" />\n\nIn June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project \u2013 four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/microsoft-releases-building-footprints/|title=Microsoft releases more than 100 million Building Footprints in the US as open data|date=2018-07-03|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data|title=Microsoft Releases 125 million Building Footprints in the US as Open Data|website=blogs.bing.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nWhile OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.\n\n===Data format===\nOpenStreetMap uses a [[topology|topological]] [[graph (discrete mathematics)|data structure]], with four core elements (also known as ''data primitives''):\n* ''Nodes'' are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a [[latitude]] and a [[longitude]]) according to [[WGS 84]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WGS_84 WGS 84] ''OpenStreetMap Wiki''</ref> Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as [[point of interest|points of interest]] or mountain peaks.\n* ''Ways'' are ordered lists of ''nodes'', representing a [[polyline]], or possibly a [[polygon]] if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.\n* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called \"members\"), where each member can optionally have a \"role\" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.\n* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219\u2013230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Data storage===\nThe OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.\n\nThe main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database with [[PostGIS]] extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenStreetMap Wiki: Database |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database |website=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs |title=Databases and data access APIs |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.\n\nFor data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called [[Openstreetmap:planet.osm|planet.osm]]. These dumps exist in two formats, one using [[XML]] and one using the [[Protocol Buffers|Protocol Buffer Binary Format]] (PBF).\n\n===Popular services===\n[[Image:Moovit Navigate 3.0.png|thumb|upright|Moovit Navigate]]\nA variety of popular services incorporate some sort of [[geolocation]] or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:\n* [[Apple Inc.]] unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for [[IPhoto#iOS version|iPhoto for iOS]] on {{Start date|df=yes|2012|03|07}}, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source \u2013 though this was corrected in 1.0.1.

Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.\n\nSome committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.\n\n=== Street-level image data ===\nIn addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360\u00b0 image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[OpenStreetCam]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Government data===\nSome government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, OSM uses [[Landsat 7]] satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from [[NOAA]], and [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported, while [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.\n\n[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.\n\n===Route planning===\nIn February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|accessdate = 28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.\n\n==Map usage==\n\n===Software for viewing maps===\n[[File:Soho - map 1.png|thumb|OpenStreetMap of [[Soho]], central London, shown in \"standard\" OpenStreetMap layer]]\n[[File:MapBox Streets example of a map of Soho, London.png|thumb|Same as above, shown in [[Mapbox]] Streets layer]]\n[[File:India OpenStreetMap data loading in QGIS.gif|thumb|Raw OpenStreetMap data of India loading in [[QGIS]] for analysis and mapmaking]]{{See also|Comparison of free off-line GPS software#Free maps}}\n;[[Web browser]]\n:Data provided by the OpenStreetMap project can be viewed in a [[web browser]] with [[JavaScript]] support via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) on its official website.

This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |author=Simon Poole |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |author=Harry Wood |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAll data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence.

The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].<ref name=\"osm-wiki-legalfaq\" />\n\n===Commercial data contributions===\nSome OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.\n\nNotably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay.

They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.\n* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called \"members\"), where each member can optionally have a \"role\" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.\n* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219\u2013230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Data storage===\nThe OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.\n\nThe main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database.

He was denied entry to the [[University of Cambridge]] because he was a Catholic,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}} and subsequently went to [[Munich]] where he studied at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University]] and resided in the house of [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], the theologian and forerunner of the [[Old Catholic Church]], with whom he became lifelong friends.<ref name=Gronbacher /> D\u00f6llinger inspired in him a deep love of historical research and a profound conception of its functions as a critical instrument in the study of sociopolitical liberty.<ref name=\"Gronbacher\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gronbacher |first=Gregory |authorlink=  |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter=Acton, Lord (1834\u20131902) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n3 |isbn= 978-1412965804 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=4\u20135 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nHe was a master of the principal foreign languages, and began at an early age to collect a magnificent historical library, which he intended to use to compose a \"History of Liberty\".

In 1855, he was appointed [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Shropshire.<ref name = Dod/> A year later, he was attached to [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville's]] mission to Moscow as British representative at the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in [[Shropshire]]. He was returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that same year as member for the Irish [[Carlow Borough (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Carlow]] and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1865]], when he headed the Liberal ballot for [[Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgnorth]] near his Shropshire home. Acton defeated Conservative leader [[Henry Whitmore]], who successfully [[election petition|petitioned]] for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the [[Reform Act 1867]], Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868]] but to no avail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nActon took a great interest in the United States, considering its [[Federal republic|federal]] structure the perfect guarantor of individual liberties. During the [[American Civil War]], his sympathies lay entirely with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], for their defence of [[States' Rights]] against a centralised government that he believed would, by what he thought to be all historical precedent, inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. After the South's surrender, he wrote to [[Robert E.

(1962). ''The Acton/Newman Relations: The Dilemma of Christian Liberalism''. Fordham University Press.</ref> In 1862, he merged this periodical into the ''Home and Foreign Review''. His contributions at once gave evidence of his remarkable wealth of historical knowledge. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his whole spirit as a historian was hostile to [[ultramontane]] pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism of view speedily brought him into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman|Wiseman]] publicly censured the ''Review''; and when in 1864, after [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]]'s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the ''[[North British Review]]'', which, previously a Scottish [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church]] organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn the March 1862 ''Rambler'', Acton wrote: \"The Celts are not among the progressive, initiative races, but among those which supply the materials rather than the impulse of history, and are either stationary or retrogressive. The Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the [[Teutons]] are the only makers of history, the only authors of advancement. Other races possessing a highly developed language, a speculative religion, enjoying luxury and art, attain to a certain pitch of cultivation which they are unable to either communicate or to increase. They are a negative element in the world.\" And: \"Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31278|title=The History of Freedom, and Other Essays|first=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton|last=Acton|date=15 February 2010|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Lord Acton's dictum|\"Lord Acton's dictum\"|Acton's dictum}}In 1870, along with his mentor [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]], Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the [[doctrine]] of [[papal infallibility]] in the [[First Vatican Council]], travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tonsor | first1 = Stephen J | year = 1959 | title = Lord Acton on Dollinger's Historical Theology | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013352 | doi=10.2307/2708113| jstor = 2708113 }}</ref> Unlike [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]] Acton did not become an [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the [[last rites]] on his deathbed.<ref>{{cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |wstitle=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, Baron Acton |volume=1}}</ref>  The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic [[Mandell Creighton]], dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\n<blockquote>But if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylese]] denunciations and [[Pharisaism]] in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like [[Ravaillac]]; but if what one hears is true, then [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] asked the gaoler to murder [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]], and [[William III of England]] ordered his Scots minister to [[Massacre of Glencoe|extirpate a clan]]. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than [[Haman]], for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.<ref name=\"lmcone\"/></blockquote>\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological [[polemics]]. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}} His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' of January 1878 on \"Democracy in Europe;\" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on \"The History of Freedom in Antiquity\" and \"The History of Freedom in Christianity\"\u2014these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected \"History of Liberty;\" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the ''[[English Historical Review]]'', which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, [[Cannes]], and [[Tegernsee]] in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the [[University of Munich]]; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Laws]], and in 1889 Oxford the [[Doctor of Civil Law]]; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on ''[[The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance]]'', Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to ''[[The Times]]'', illustrating Gladstone's main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone's conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton's letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the [[Holy See]] to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded \"communion with Rome as dearer than life\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1865 Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley (1841-1923), daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, with whom he had six children:<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p145.htm#i1445 John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton of Aldenham] at thepeerage.com</ref>\n\n# Hon.

Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir [[John Robert Seeley|John Seeley]], Lord [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Rosebery]] appointed him to the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Modern History]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref name=Gronbacher /> He delivered two courses of lectures on the [[French Revolution]] and on Modern History, but it was in private that the effects of his teaching were felt most. The ''Cambridge Modern History'', though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nActon health began to fail in 1901, and on 19 June 1902, in his 69th year, he died at the [[spa]] town of [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]], [[German Empire|Germany]], whilst staying at his wife's family home there. His body was buried in a small communal graveyard by [[Lake Tegernsee]], the grave lying today unmarked having lost its headstone in the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>'Lord Acton', by Roland Hill (Pub. Yale University Press, 2000)</ref> He was succeeded in the title by his son, [[Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton]]. His 60,000-volume library, formed for use and not for display and composed largely of books full of his own annotations, was bought prior to his death by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in secret in order to secure the library for Acton's use during his lifetime, then upon Lord Acton's death, presented to [[John Morley]], who forthwith gave it to the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}{{sfn|\"Autobiography of Andrew and The Gospel of Wealth\"|2006|p=166}}\nAccording to [[Hugh Chisholm]], editor of the 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'':\n{{quote|Lord Acton has left too little completed original work to rank among the great historians; his very learning seems to have stood in his way; he knew too much and his literary conscience was too acute for him to write easily, and his copiousness of information overloads his literary style.

Acton defeated Conservative leader [[Henry Whitmore]], who successfully [[election petition|petitioned]] for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the [[Reform Act 1867]], Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868]] but to no avail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nActon took a great interest in the United States, considering its [[Federal republic|federal]] structure the perfect guarantor of individual liberties. During the [[American Civil War]], his sympathies lay entirely with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], for their defence of [[States' Rights]] against a centralised government that he believed would, by what he thought to be all historical precedent, inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. After the South's surrender, he wrote to [[Robert E. Lee]] that \"I mourn for the stake which was lost at Richmond more deeply than I rejoice over that which was saved at Waterloo,\" adding that he \"deemed that you were fighting battles for our liberty, our progress, and our civilization.\"<ref>[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig3/acton-lee.html 4 Nov 1866, letter to Robert E.

(1962). ''The Acton/Newman Relations: The Dilemma of Christian Liberalism''. Fordham University Press.</ref> In 1862, he merged this periodical into the ''Home and Foreign Review''. His contributions at once gave evidence of his remarkable wealth of historical knowledge. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his whole spirit as a historian was hostile to [[ultramontane]] pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism of view speedily brought him into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman|Wiseman]] publicly censured the ''Review''; and when in 1864, after [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]]'s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the ''[[North British Review]]'', which, previously a Scottish [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church]] organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn the March 1862 ''Rambler'', Acton wrote: \"The Celts are not among the progressive, initiative races, but among those which supply the materials rather than the impulse of history, and are either stationary or retrogressive. The Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the [[Teutons]] are the only makers of history, the only authors of advancement. Other races possessing a highly developed language, a speculative religion, enjoying luxury and art, attain to a certain pitch of cultivation which they are unable to either communicate or to increase. They are a negative element in the world.\" And: \"Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31278|title=The History of Freedom, and Other Essays|first=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton|last=Acton|date=15 February 2010|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Lord Acton's dictum|\"Lord Acton's dictum\"|Acton's dictum}}In 1870, along with his mentor [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]], Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the [[doctrine]] of [[papal infallibility]] in the [[First Vatican Council]], travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tonsor | first1 = Stephen J | year = 1959 | title = Lord Acton on Dollinger's Historical Theology | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013352 | doi=10.2307/2708113| jstor = 2708113 }}</ref> Unlike [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]] Acton did not become an [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the [[last rites]] on his deathbed.<ref>{{cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |wstitle=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, Baron Acton |volume=1}}</ref>  The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic [[Mandell Creighton]], dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\n<blockquote>But if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylese]] denunciations and [[Pharisaism]] in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like [[Ravaillac]]; but if what one hears is true, then [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] asked the gaoler to murder [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]], and [[William III of England]] ordered his Scots minister to [[Massacre of Glencoe|extirpate a clan]]. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than [[Haman]], for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.<ref name=\"lmcone\"/></blockquote>\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological [[polemics]]. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}} His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' of January 1878 on \"Democracy in Europe;\" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on \"The History of Freedom in Antiquity\" and \"The History of Freedom in Christianity\"\u2014these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected \"History of Liberty;\" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the ''[[English Historical Review]]'', which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, [[Cannes]], and [[Tegernsee]] in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the [[University of Munich]]; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Laws]], and in 1889 Oxford the [[Doctor of Civil Law]]; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on ''[[The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance]]'', Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to ''[[The Times]]'', illustrating Gladstone's main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone's conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton's letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the [[Holy See]] to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded \"communion with Rome as dearer than life\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1865 Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley (1841-1923), daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, with whom he had six children:<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p145.htm#i1445 John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton of Aldenham] at thepeerage.com</ref>\n\n# Hon.

Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir [[John Robert Seeley|John Seeley]], Lord [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Rosebery]] appointed him to the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Modern History]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref name=Gronbacher /> He delivered two courses of lectures on the [[French Revolution]] and on Modern History, but it was in private that the effects of his teaching were felt most. The ''Cambridge Modern History'', though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nActon health began to fail in 1901, and on 19 June 1902, in his 69th year, he died at the [[spa]] town of [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]], [[German Empire|Germany]], whilst staying at his wife's family home there. His body was buried in a small communal graveyard by [[Lake Tegernsee]], the grave lying today unmarked having lost its headstone in the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>'Lord Acton', by Roland Hill (Pub. Yale University Press, 2000)</ref> He was succeeded in the title by his son, [[Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton]]. His 60,000-volume library, formed for use and not for display and composed largely of books full of his own annotations, was bought prior to his death by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in secret in order to secure the library for Acton's use during his lifetime, then upon Lord Acton's death, presented to [[John Morley]], who forthwith gave it to the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}{{sfn|\"Autobiography of Andrew and The Gospel of Wealth\"|2006|p=166}}\nAccording to [[Hugh Chisholm]], editor of the 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'':\n{{quote|Lord Acton has left too little completed original work to rank among the great historians; his very learning seems to have stood in his way; he knew too much and his literary conscience was too acute for him to write easily, and his copiousness of information overloads his literary style.

Sickles felt the slightly higher ground forward of his placement by Meade was better ground to defend and pushed units forward several hundred yards. This put him in a situation where there was a significant gap between his left flank and Sykes' V Corps right flank. This gap made the holding of the federal line a close-run thing. The 17th as part of Birney's Division was pushed forward to occupy the stone wall at the western edge of the Wheat Field abutting the woods there. Only the intervention of the V Corps saved the II Corps from annihilation. 17th Maine saw hot and heavy action being attacked from two sides.
