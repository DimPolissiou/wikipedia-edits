He is one of the world's first [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], and was originally a principal villain for the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team and now for the [[X-Men]] and related spinoff teams. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]], Apocalypse first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #5 (May 1986).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50581 |title=Walt Simonson Remasters \"Star Slammers,\" Talks \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" |website=Comic Book Resources |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> Apocalypse is one of the most powerful beings in the [[Marvel universe]].\n\nSince his introduction, the character has appeared in a number of ''[[X-Men]]'' titles, including [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s and several [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. Apocalypse has also been featured in various forms of [[Apocalypse in other media|media]].\n\n==Conception and creation==\nWhile writing the first five issues of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', [[Bob Layton]] dropped hints of a villain operating behind the scenes and leading the [[Alliance of Evil]] (mentioned in ''X-Factor'' #4, May 1986). Layton intended to reveal this character to be the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] villain the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] on the final page of ''X-Factor'' #5.<ref name=\"back29\">{{cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Timothy |title=Nightcrawler's Two Dads and the Owl that Could Have Been|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|pages=58\u201361 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> However, Layton left the book after writing this issue and was replaced by writer [[Louise Simonson]]. Editor [[Bob Harras]] said that the character arose because of storytelling needs: \"All I had communicated to Louise was my desire that an A-level, first class character be introduced. I wanted a [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]-level villain who would up the stakes and give the X-Factor team reason to exist.\"<ref name=CBR2009/>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Simonson explained that when the ''X-Factor'' series was created, the original five X-Men were pulled out of the purview of [[Chris Claremont]], who was writing ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]''. However, Simonson felt that the series need an archenemy, or what Simonson called \"a big, bad villain\", and conceived of Apocalypse.<ref name=PhillyEnquirer>Maida, Jerome (May 27, 2016). [http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20160527_Louise_Simonson_discusses_the_creation_of_Apocalypse.html \"Louise Simonson discusses the creation of Apocalypse\"]. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.</ref> Simonson described the character thus:\n\n<blockquote> \"When ''X-Factor'' was created, it caused a split in the \"Mutant World\" [and] several seminal characters were pulled out of [writer] [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''X-Men''.\"\n\n\"Apocalypse is the first mutant \u2013 a brilliant shape-shifter who is virtually immortal \u2013 and sees himself as the father of mutantkind\u2026In his early years, which I covered in the ''X-Factor Forever'' miniseries . . . Apocalypse encountered the Celestials and realized there was a time when humanity might be judged unworthy and destroyed. Consequently, he's been using Darwinian principles - survival of the fittest - to kill off the weak and force the survivors to grow stronger, to push humanity to get better and more powerful. He considers himself the Apocalypse of modern man and the father of what humanity will come next - Mutantkind. Where Magneto sees mutants as the next step of evolution and strives to protect all mutants, Apocalypse believes in absolute survival of the fittest - so if the Hulk, for example, is stronger than [the X-Men's] Colossus...well, in Apocalypse's world he would say, 'Bye, bye, comrade.'\"<ref name=PhillyEnquirer/></blockquote>\n\nHarras also commented, \"As soon as I saw the sketch by Walter [Simonson] and heard Louise's take on him, I knew we had the character I wanted. [[Jackson Guice|Jackson [Guice]]] redrew the page, patching in the [[unseen character|shadowy]] Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's.\"<ref name=CBR2009>Callahan, Timothy (September 28, 2009). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23092 \"When Words Collide\"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref> Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: \"The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page\u2014just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe there was even a character sketch done for him at that point\u2014I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern.\"<ref name=CBR2009/> Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5.<ref name=\"back29\"/> Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: \"I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels at the end of one of Jackson\u2019s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit.\"<ref>Papadimitropoulos, Thomas (March 6, 2012).

Comicdom.</ref>\n\nBob Harras said on the character of Apocalypse:\n\n{{quote|He looked fantastic. Also, the name is dynamic. It tells you right off this character means trouble. And he came with a clear-cut agenda: '[[survival of the fittest]].' He didn't care if you were a mutant\u2014if you were weak, you would be destroyed. He was merciless, but his philosophy was easy to grasp and it fit in with the harder edge of evolution which is part and parcel of the mutant story. Isn't that what humans fear about mutants? That they are the next step? Now, we had given mutants something new to fear: a character who would judge them on their genetic worthiness. [...] To his own mind he wasn't evil (despite his leadership of the Alliance of Evil, which I think we dropped pretty soon after Apocalypse's introduction); he believed he was doing the right thing. He was ensuring evolution. To me, he was the perfect next step in the mutant story.<ref name=CBR2009/>}}\n\nAlthough the character first appeared in 1986, he was retroactively said to have been present during previously published stories. The unnamed benefactor of the [[Living Monolith]] in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #17 (1985) was later identified as Apocalypse in disguise.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #376 (January 2000)</ref> ''Classic X-Men'' #25 revealed that years earlier, Apocalypse encountered the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]] and granted him superhuman power.\n\nDuring his run on ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]] planned a story to reveal that Apocalypse was the third Summers brother, a mysterious sibling to the mutants Cyclops and Havok. But Weinberg left the book before he could go along with his plan and the third Summers brother was revealed to be the mutant Gabriel Summers, aka [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QchZYEKr?url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archivedate=2007-07-26 |work=Comixfan Forums > Comixfan Discussions > Comixfan Columns |title=No Prisoners #3: The Third Summers Brother |publisher=Comixfan.com |date=December 22, 2003 |accessdate=2014-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApocalypse was the principal adversary in the mid-1980s ''[[X-Men]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (1986\u20131991), until being apparently killed at the climax of issue #68 (July 1991). Since then, the character has died and been resurrected several times thanks to his power and advanced alien technology. His name En Sabah Nur was revealed in Cable #6 (Dec 1993) and his [[birthplace]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) and the origin of his technology, were revealed in ''[[X-Force]]'' #37 (August 1994). According to Marvel, the name translates as \"The First One\" (although, in reality, the translation is considered grammatically incorrect, as it means \"The First/Morning Light\" [En-(\"The\") + Sabah- (\"Morning\") + Nur- (\"Light\")] ).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Apocalypse_%28En_Sabah_Nur%29 |title=Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) - Marvel Universe Wiki: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}</ref> It is later revealed in the origin story ''[[Rise of Apocalypse]]'' that he is possibly the first mutant (meaning, in this case, a human being born with the X-gene), born 5,000 years ago. The character gained greater popularity in 1995 when the storyline \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" featured an [[alternate timeline]] in which Apocalypse has conquered much of planet Earth.\n \nThe character was reincarnated in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #1 as a small boy with no memory of his previous incarnation.

He was born with the mutant X-gene, and possibly the first living being on Earth to express it. Because of his grey skin and blue lips, his people abandoned him as an infant. He was rescued by Baal of the Sandstormers who saw the child's potential power and will to survive. Baal named him En Sabah Nur, which Marvel translates as \"The First One\". The Sandstormers lived by the credo of [[survival of the fittest]], believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life.<ref>Rise of Apocalypse #1</ref> It is also revealed during the Apocalypse Wars that, while still a young boy, En Sabah Nur was very generous and selfless, to the chagrin of Baal. A time-displaced Evan Sabah Nur and All-New X-Men Beast tried to save En Sabah Nur, but he allowed himself to be captured to help them escape.<ref>All New X-Men Vol. 2 Issue #11</ref>\n\nAround this time, the time-traveller [[Kang the Conqueror]] arrived in Egypt and assumed the identity of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]] and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, left behind by the deity-like aliens known as [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself [[Apocalypse]]. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.<ref>''Rise of Apocalypse'' #1-4</ref>\n\nIt is revealed in the series ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' that Apocalypse, at some point in the days of Ancient Egypt, joined forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield to successfully fend off a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] invasion. Also present were [[Imhotep]] and a man who was either the moon god called [[Khonsu|Khonshu]] or his first [[Moon Knight]] avatar/champion.<ref>''S.H.I.E.L.D'' #1</ref>\n\n===Early history===\nAs the millennia pass, Apocalypse travels around planet Earth, convincing civilizations that he is a [[deity]] (inspiring different myths as a result) and manipulating them into fighting wars. He justifies that this encourages \"growth, judgment, and destruction\".<ref>''X-Factor'' #24</ref> Apocalypse's progeny become the [[Clan Akkaba]]. Apocalypse encounters the near-immortal human offshoot race known as [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], primarily the members [[Ikaris]] and [[Sersi]], who refer to him as their \"Ancient Nemesis\".<ref>''New Eternals: Apocalypse Now!''</ref>  At different points, Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to enter periods of [[suspended animation]], leaving Clan Akkaba and Ozymandias to act in his stead.\n\nIn 1013 AD, Apocalypse seeks to destroy the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who he knows will cause him trouble in the future, according to information obtained from Rama-Tut,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #6 (2013)</ref> yet the plans are foiled by Odin. In the 12th century, Apocalypse encounters the Eternal Sersi again while awakening latent mutant powers in a crusader named Bennet du Paris, also known as [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].<ref>''Black Knight: Exodus''</ref> In 1459, Apocalypse defeats [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler)]] in Romania, who later becomes the vampire more popularly known as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Count Dracula]].<ref>''Apocalypse vs Dracula'' #1 (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1859, Apocalypse encounters British scientist Nathaniel Essex and learns more about the nature of mutants. Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to transform Essex into the superhuman being [[Mister Sinister]]. He then coerces Sinister and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] into aiding his plans for global conquest, but Sinister concludes that these plans are madness and betrays Apocalypse, forcing him back into hibernation.<ref>''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1\u20134</ref> In 1897, Count Dracula attacks the Clan Akkaba in revenge for his defeat at Apocalypse's hands, forcing the Clan to revive their master from suspended animation.

Pencils by [[Jos\u00e9 Ladr\u00f6nn]].]]\nApocalypse learns of Sinister's intention to create an adversary powerful enough to destroy him: Nathan Christopher Charles Summers, the son of Scott Summers and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Apocalypse, viewing him as a threat and realizing that Nathan's energy is the very energy that awoke him all those months earlier,<ref>''Cable'' #75</ref> sends his newly formed group, the Riders of the Storm, to abduct the Summers child. Apocalypse at this time had conquered the city of [[Attilan]], home of the [[Inhumans]], as well as enslaved part of its population. X-Factor, alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, attacks Apocalypse's lunar stronghold. Although Apocalypse is severely defeated, the young Nathan is infected with a [[techno-organic virus]] and is sent to the future with a woman named Askani to be cured.<ref>''X-Factor'' #65-68</ref>\n\nIn the future, Apocalypse has conquered the Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse's body had grown feeble:<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix'' #1</ref> he becomes aware of the young Nathan's presence in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone's stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan.<ref>''The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1-4</ref> Nathan grows up to become the warrior [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as [[Stryfe]]) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse's future domination of the planet.\n\nIn the present, Apocalypse is prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his Riders (now calling themselves The [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]), who inform their master that his Horsemen have kidnapped Cyclops and Jean Grey, supposedly under his instructions (in actuality, Mister Sinister, who was posing as Apocalypse).<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #14</ref> When attempting to rejuvenate himself again, Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe who had arrived in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. After a battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref>\n\nThe Dark Riders' new leader, [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Genesis]] (the adopted son of Cable, who had traveled to the present to ensure Apocalypse's rise and exact revenge on his father), plans to resurrect Apocalypse by sacrificing the lives of the people in villages neighboring Akkaba. During this time, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is held captive by Genesis, who attempts to restore Wolverine's lost [[adamantium]] skeleton and turn him into a Horseman as a gift for Apocalypse. Wolverine breaks free and kills Genesis along with nearly all of the Dark Riders. Genesis had built a [[sarcophagus]] with Apocalypse's likeness (which is empty,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #100</ref> since Apocalypse had already revived<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #19 (January 1995)</ref>).\n\n===Further schemes===\nAfter a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at his side and quickly learns of the present danger: [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #335 (August 1996)</ref> He observes the conflict between the psionic entity and Earth's heroes with [[Uatu the Watcher]], who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one who hated him the most, Cable.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #336 (September 1996)</ref> Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught will be most vulnerable through the [[astral plane]] and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse removes the captive [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the [[Invisible Woman]], who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.<ref>''Cable'' #35</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of the ''Onslaught'' saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the [[Hulk]] and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two separate entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards' [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|pocket universe]]. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk's nexus-energy to overcome the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against the New World Order, a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the planet. The New World Order in turn set the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and the [[Absorbing Man]] against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which the New World Order had obtained, destroying their headquarters.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #455-457</ref>\n\nThe Hellfire Club later awakens Apocalypse's long-hidden Harbinger from its deep sleep: originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to [[incubation period|incubate]] for 100 years. Apocalypse releases his Horseman (Caliban) and his scribe Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves, if they were to survive the coming events.<ref>''Cable'' #53</ref> Cable with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battles the Harbinger, but are unable to stop it. Apocalypse then appears, activating a bomb inside the Harbinger intended to destroy all of New York, but Cable manages to prevent this disaster.<ref>''Cable'' #66-68</ref>\n\nWhen [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] is disrupting Earth's [[magnetic field]], Apocalypse sends a [[Skrull]] impersonating the mutant [[Astra (comics)|Astra]] (having dealt with the original Astra) to stop the Master of Magnetism.<ref>''Magneto War''</ref>\n\nIntending to start an all-out war between the humans and the subterranean-dwelling [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] as part of his plan to test the strong, Apocalypse sets off [[nuclear warheads]] at [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]], causing the Deviants to further mutate (which also restores Ikaris' father [[Virako]] to life). Apocalypse launches an attack at [[San Francisco]], using a mentally controlled Deviant, [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]], now a gigantic monster, that the Eternals are forced to battle. Apocalypse is confronted by his centuries-old foe, Ikaris, who now is a [[Prime Eternal]]. Although Apocalypse defeats Ikaris, the Eternal still succeeds in destroying his ship and thwarting his plan.<ref>New Eternals #1: Apocalypse Now, February 2000</ref>\n\n===The Twelve===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Grey]] -->\n{{Main|Apocalypse: The Twelve}}\n[[Image:ApocalypseTwelve.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Apocalypse merges with Cyclops in ''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97 (February 2000).

The Twelve legend was in fact a ruse, orchestrated by Apocalypse himself: once the Twelve are assembled, Apocalypse intended to use them to transform himself into a deitylike entity beyond the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #377, 2000</ref> It is revealed at the end of this story arc, that Apocalypse's physical form has been burned out due to the vast amount of energies he has under his control, forcing him to wear a bio-armor (like his future counterpart) and now plans to use [[Nate Grey]] as a host body for him to move his energy and consciousness into. The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97</ref> While the merge is successful, Apocalypse's aim for unlimited power is not and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios (see [[Ages of Apocalypse]]). Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #98</ref>\n\nAn amnesiac and powerless cyborg Cyclops regains control of the merged form, but Apocalypse begins to re-emerge. Jean and Cable are alerted to his location in Egypt, where Jean in the end manages to free Cyclops by telepathically tearing out Apocalypse's essence from her husband's body, rendering Apocalypse in an incorporeal [[astral plane|astral]] form, which Cable apparently destroys using his Psimitar.<ref>''X-Men: The Search of Cyclops'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Xmen182vol.2.jpg|185px|thumb|left|''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182 (April 2006). Cover art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]\nIn the aftermath of the 2005 \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline, in which most of the mutants lost their powers, Apocalypse was revealed to be alive and well. The techno-organic virus, with which he long ago infected Cable, was revealed to be the means by which Apocalypse's spirit reconstituted itself. With only a drop of his blood into a vat of organs and blood, the virus rewrote the genetic code of the material within to form a body for Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #27</ref> Apocalypse awakes from a slumber in a tomb in Akkaba, recalling:<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #181</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Across the world\u2014helpless mutants slaughtered. Pogroms. Horror. ...Something has woken me from my slumber. Once, a sudden surge in worldwide mutant power stirred me from a similar sleep. Now\u2014a plummet in global mutant capacity\u2014has opened my eyes.</blockquote>\n\nApocalypse finds himself on a planet with its mutant population reduced to a fraction of what it had been, only a few hundred remaining out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable's hands. Reappearing inside a [[Sphinx]]-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182</ref> The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #183</ref> Bent on becoming the new [[messiah]] for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the [[United Nations]] in New York and issues an [[ultimatum]]: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #185</ref><ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book|last = Sanderson |first=Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City| publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, Apocalypse's horsemen are lost, Ozymandias betrays him, and he is forced to retreat by a combined assault of the X-Men and the Avengers. Ultimately, it is discovered that the Celestials ''lent'' their technology to Apocalypse, requiring as payment ''greater sufferings later''. He attempts to embrace death as an escape from his lifelong pact, only to find himself instantly resurrected and hearing a voice: \"''We cannot let you die. Not yet. It is time Apocalypse\u2026 it is time''\".<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #186</ref>\n\nIn a future timeline seen in the 2009 storyline \"[[Messiah War]]\", a greatly weakened Apocalypse is attacked by [[Stryfe]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], but he survives the attack. Afterward, Apocalypse contacts [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] in the future and begs him to kill him. Archangel refuses and instead hands over some of his techno organic wing blades to him, telling Apocalypse he no longer holds any control over him. Coming into contact with the blades rejuvenates Apocalypse and he offers to join forces with Archangel to kill Stryfe who is on the verge of killing X-Force, Cable, Bishop, as well as [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>''X-Force'' Vol.2 #15</ref> Archangel takes Apocalypse to a Celestial ship, where Apocalypse is then fully restored and wants to avenge what Stryfe did to him.<ref>''Cable #15''</ref> Just as Stryfe is on the verge of taking Hope for himself, Apocalypse and Archangel confront and defeat Stryfe. Apocalypse releases Hope into Cable's care, but says that he will return for her eventually. Apocalypse then drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol.2 #16</ref> Stryfe manages to escape and travels back in time to the present.<ref>Cable & X-Force #18</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn the 2010 \"[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]\" storyline, versions of Apocalypse and his Horsemen from a possible future appear in the Avengers Tower after Kang breaks time itself. After a fight with the Avengers, he and his Horsemen disappear.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref>\n\nApocalypse's followers, the [[Clan Akkaba]], manage to bring about Apocalypse's return, albeit in the form of a child they will indoctrinate. Upon learning of Apocalypse's return, X-Force seeks to kill him, but when they discover he is a child, Psylocke decides to protect him, believing they can rehabilitate him and train him as a force for good. To the shock of the rest of the team, Fantomex fatally shoots the child.<ref>\n[[Rick Remender]] (w), [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] (a). ''Uncanny X-Force'' #4 (March 2011).

The boy, code-named Genesis, helps X-force fight Archangel and when the battle is over, Fantomex enrolls him in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18-19</ref>\n\n====Evan Sabahnur====\nIn ''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #4 (March 2012), Evan Sabahnur a.k.a. Genesis is admitted as a student to the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, where his classmates notice his resemblance to Apocalypse. En is worried when a visiting [[Deathlok]], who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs him that this is what Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.<ref>[[Jason Aaron]] (w), [[Nick Bradshaw]] (a). \"Just Another Day in Westchester County\".

After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.<ref>''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #10. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nA new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] son [[Daken]], kidnaps Evan during a field trip to [[Genosha]]'s remains. Hoping to sway the boy into becoming Apocalypse, the Brotherhood reveals to him that he is a clone and tells him of X-Force's assassination of the child En Sabah Nur from which he was cloned and the falsehood of his life under the tutelage of [[Fantomex]]. After the Brotherhood reveals that they have killed Fantomex and further tortures Evan, Daken tells En that he has a choice: either immediately ascend as Apocalypse and kill the Brotherhood as revenge for the death of \"Uncle Cluster\", or let the rest of X-Force die at the Brotherhood's hands to avenge the death of the original boy En Sabah Nur and to prevent X-Force from killing Evan the way they killed Apocalypse and Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #25-35</ref>\n\nDaken offers Evan a suit of Apocalypse's Celestial armor to do with what he will, secretly planning to control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the [[Shadow King]]. After Deadpool's failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine's death at Daken's hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse's armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool will always be there for him when he needs him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #35. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater Deadpool enlists Evan and Quentin's help to help him saving his daughter Eleanor Camacho from the [[Flag-Smasher]], with Evan promising Quentin a bloodbath and some action to motivate him. He manages to save Ellie's life and proposes Deadpool to let Quentin erase from the girl's mind every memory of the ordeal. Deadpool loudly refuses and to Evan's surprise, he hugs him and tells him to stay in school.<ref>''Deadpool'' #33 (2014) Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the 2014 \"[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\" storyline, Evan is one of many mutants captured by the [[Red Skull]] on the island of Genosha.<ref>''Magneto'' (vol. 3) #9.

Marvel Comics</ref> In the energy released when the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Doctor Doom]] use the combined power of order and chaos spells to suppress the Red Skull's personality in favor of the sliver of Professor X's that still exists in his brain, Evan ascends to adulthood, stepping out of the rubble with a looming, muscular body and the presence and appearance of Apocalypse. Deadpool even comments on how changed Evan is. When [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and Cyclops argue with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and the new [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] over who should take custody of the body of Red Skull, Evan convinces the Summers brothers that Professor X is dead and they have other problems to deal with.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4.

Inspired by Deadpool's words, Apocalypse turns on the X-Men and the Avengers, allowing the Astonishing Avengers (along with non-inverted heroes Steve Rogers and [[Spider-Man]]) to retrieve the White Skull and undo the inversion. At the conclusion of the storyline, Evan is shown on the run with Deadpool.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Apocalypse Wars===\nDuring the Apocalypse Wars, the Extraordinary X-Men travel thousands of years into Earth's future in order to rescue Colossus and his team of young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse's rule as he functioned as the Omega World's heart, keeping it alive, while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #11</ref> Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undo the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. It's left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new host body.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #12</ref>\nApocalypse was kept at X-Haven, inside a cell specially built to contain him by Forge,<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #13</ref> and later after again retrieving Colossus, Forge tried to find a way to cure him by reverse engineering Apocalypse's powers but failed.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #14</ref> During the World-Eater's attack on Limbo, Nightcrawler agreed to free Apocalypse in exchange for a cure for his friend.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #15</ref> After returning Colossus to his normal self, Nightcrawler indeed released Apocalypse from his prison, however what Apocalypse didn't expect was that Nightcrawler would throw him into the vortex created by the World-Eater to consume Limbo, seemingly killing him in the process.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #16</ref>\n\n===Degeneration===\nApocalypse is later revealed to be back on Earth, no details about what the Celestials did to him were revealed, and is shown performing experiments to create an immortal vessel which he can then use as a host for his vast power and consciousness by utilizing a modified ancient Celestial technology known as the Finch, which can repair genetic decay. His efforts are not in vain, as he begins to impose his own consciousness onto a human test subject, the fourth attempt, lending it his own regenerative powers to withstand the assault. However, the test subject resists the process, causing a massive chain reaction that bathes Apocalypse and the subject in a wave of energy. Apocalypse's mind and body are torn apart. He finds his mind wandering to that of his birth before his being is fused, mixed, and exploded along with this human form. Once the wave subsides, Apocalypse finds himself in a strange new land that he deduces was the result of the explosion within the Celestial machine that must have caused a dimensional rift which threw him into another dimension. He also discovers that his body has changed as well. Not only does he discover that he can bleed, something that should be impossible with his injury-resistant mutant physiology, but after a fight against a resident of the twisted dimension, which he was able to defeat, Apocalypse learns that his body is actively refusing physiological mutation. Needing to breathe air for the first time in centuries, he comes to a shocking truth as he watches his hand turn from its usual mutated appearance back to a human form. He's becoming Human.<ref>''X-Men: Black - Magneto'' #1</ref> After degenerating into an ape form, he is taken out by his previous human test subjects who unlike him, had ascend in form after being empowered by Apocalypse's own DNA. He and other apes are tortured with the Finch, which was recovered and repaired by the human test subjects. When test subject D experiments on Apocalypse, he uses the last of his mutant power to try to transfer his mind into D and is finally able to possess him which restores Apocalypse to his former glory and realizes that he had not been transported to another planet, rather the earlier explosion from the Finch had simply evolved his entire South American island, infusing his superior genetics into everything the blast wave struck, transforming it into the tribulation which he had been forced to endure. Apocalypse then gave his perfect host body a trial run as he killed the remaining test subjects, while reducing the entire island to rubble that was reclaimed by the sea.<ref>''X-Men: Black - Emma Frost'' #1</ref>\n\nApocalypse was soon afterward captured by some mysterious force and is being held captive along with [[Kitty Pryde]] and anti-mutant senator Ashton Allen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #1</ref>\n\n===Dawn of X===\nApocalypse accepts Xavier's invite to enter Krakoa<ref>House of X #5</ref> and even is among the Quiet Council, a group of twelve powerful and experienced mutants who serve as the island's lawgivers. He takes up learning magic and acts as an advisor to the new Excalibur team.<ref>Excalibur #1 (2019)</ref> He appears to have devised a way to restore the powers of those who were depowered by Scarlet Witch's spell, but to do so, these ex-mutants need to prove themselves as worthy to get their powers back. Therefore, Apocalypse created the \"Crucible\", a trial by combat to death, where the ex-mutant is expected to lose in order to pass all while Apocalypse goads them about the weakness the loss of their powers created.<ref>''X-Men'' #7</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nApocalypse is an ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with a variety of superhuman abilities who further augmented himself after merging with [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] technology. He is an immortal being,<ref>''X-Force'' (vol 1.) #37 (August 1994)</ref> with total control over the molecules of his body, enabling him to alter his form as it suits him,<ref>''X-Factor'' #6 (July 1986)</ref> such as allowing his body to become extremely malleable and flexible, enhance his physical abilities, transform his limbs into weapons, wings, or jets, regenerate from fatal injuries, generate a wide range of powers at will, and adapt his body to apparently any disease or hostile environment.<ref>''X-Factor'' #68 (1991)</ref> He can also project and absorb energy and is capable of [[technopathy]], being able to directly interface with the various technologies he has at his disposal. Thanks to the aid of his mutant abilities allowing him complete control over his body, special \"regeneration\" chambers,<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15 (December 1992)</ref> Celestial technology,<ref>''Heroic Age: X-Men'' (February 2011)</ref> and changing bodies, Apocalypse has further enhanced his abilities and now he can generate almost any mutant power at his will.\n\n{{Quote box\n|width = 40%\n|salign = right\n|author= [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]]\n|quote = So what\u2026 this guy's kind of like [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] on steroids?

Like most so-called \"Class 5 Mutants,\" Apocalypse is near-[[demigod|godlike]] in his abilities and their applications. Among his more aggressive powers is the apparent ability to create objects (including enormous buildings and structures but also clothing, weapons, armor, etc.) from [[dust]] within seconds and also to turn objects into dust, also within seconds. Another of his major powers is his ability to augment the powers of other mutants, a power he uses very selectively and chiefly as a means to recruit co-conspirators for his plans for [[world domination]]. The mutants whose powers he augments are sometimes taken with him as [[apprentice]]s and eventual [[acolyte]]s, and are treated as his children; however, even in such a role, a given mutant might suddenly be deemed unfit by Apocalypse and ejected from his confidence, at any time.\n\n==Other versions==\n[[File:Apocalypse AoA.jpg|185px|right|thumb|''Apocalypse'', as depicted in the pages of ''X-Men Alpha'' (February 1995), during the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline.

Following a heavy assault by the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and SHIELD forces, he emerges from an explosion in a red and silver version of his traditional blue cybernetic battle armor. He is also capable of adapting to and overcoming Professor Xavier's psychic assault despite his training during his time in the future with Cable. Cable makes the most concrete implication that evolving is the major element of his powers when he remarks that Xavier must kill Apocalypse quickly before he adapts to his attacks and becomes immune to the telepathy.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #92.

He is one of the world's first [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], and was originally a principal villain for the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team and now for the [[X-Men]] and related spinoff teams. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]], Apocalypse first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #5 (May 1986).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50581 |title=Walt Simonson Remasters \"Star Slammers,\" Talks \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" |website=Comic Book Resources |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> Apocalypse is one of the most powerful beings in the [[Marvel universe]].\n\nSince his introduction, the character has appeared in a number of ''[[X-Men]]'' titles, including [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s and several [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. Apocalypse has also been featured in various forms of [[Apocalypse in other media|media]].\n\n==Conception and creation==\nWhile writing the first five issues of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', [[Bob Layton]] dropped hints of a villain operating behind the scenes and leading the [[Alliance of Evil]] (mentioned in ''X-Factor'' #4, May 1986). Layton intended to reveal this character to be the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] villain the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] on the final page of ''X-Factor'' #5.<ref name=\"back29\">{{cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Timothy |title=Nightcrawler's Two Dads and the Owl that Could Have Been|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|pages=58\u201361 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> However, Layton left the book after writing this issue and was replaced by writer [[Louise Simonson]]. Editor [[Bob Harras]] said that the character arose because of storytelling needs: \"All I had communicated to Louise was my desire that an A-level, first class character be introduced. I wanted a [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]-level villain who would up the stakes and give the X-Factor team reason to exist.\"<ref name=CBR2009/>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Simonson explained that when the ''X-Factor'' series was created, the original five X-Men were pulled out of the purview of [[Chris Claremont]], who was writing ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]''. However, Simonson felt that the series need an archenemy, or what Simonson called \"a big, bad villain\", and conceived of Apocalypse.<ref name=PhillyEnquirer>Maida, Jerome (May 27, 2016). [http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20160527_Louise_Simonson_discusses_the_creation_of_Apocalypse.html \"Louise Simonson discusses the creation of Apocalypse\"]. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.</ref> Simonson described the character thus:\n\n<blockquote> \"When ''X-Factor'' was created, it caused a split in the \"Mutant World\" [and] several seminal characters were pulled out of [writer] [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''X-Men''.\"\n\n\"Apocalypse is the first mutant \u2013 a brilliant shape-shifter who is virtually immortal \u2013 and sees himself as the father of mutantkind\u2026In his early years, which I covered in the ''X-Factor Forever'' miniseries . . . Apocalypse encountered the Celestials and realized there was a time when humanity might be judged unworthy and destroyed. Consequently, he's been using Darwinian principles - survival of the fittest - to kill off the weak and force the survivors to grow stronger, to push humanity to get better and more powerful. He considers himself the Apocalypse of modern man and the father of what humanity will come next - Mutantkind. Where Magneto sees mutants as the next step of evolution and strives to protect all mutants, Apocalypse believes in absolute survival of the fittest - so if the Hulk, for example, is stronger than [the X-Men's] Colossus...well, in Apocalypse's world he would say, 'Bye, bye, comrade.'\"<ref name=PhillyEnquirer/></blockquote>\n\nHarras also commented, \"As soon as I saw the sketch by Walter [Simonson] and heard Louise's take on him, I knew we had the character I wanted. [[Jackson Guice|Jackson [Guice]]] redrew the page, patching in the [[unseen character|shadowy]] Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's.\"<ref name=CBR2009>Callahan, Timothy (September 28, 2009). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23092 \"When Words Collide\"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref> Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: \"The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page\u2014just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe there was even a character sketch done for him at that point\u2014I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern.\"<ref name=CBR2009/> Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5.<ref name=\"back29\"/> Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: \"I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels at the end of one of Jackson\u2019s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit.\"<ref>Papadimitropoulos, Thomas (March 6, 2012).

Comicdom.</ref>\n\nBob Harras said on the character of Apocalypse:\n\n{{quote|He looked fantastic. Also, the name is dynamic. It tells you right off this character means trouble. And he came with a clear-cut agenda: '[[survival of the fittest]].' He didn't care if you were a mutant\u2014if you were weak, you would be destroyed. He was merciless, but his philosophy was easy to grasp and it fit in with the harder edge of evolution which is part and parcel of the mutant story. Isn't that what humans fear about mutants? That they are the next step? Now, we had given mutants something new to fear: a character who would judge them on their genetic worthiness. [...] To his own mind he wasn't evil (despite his leadership of the Alliance of Evil, which I think we dropped pretty soon after Apocalypse's introduction); he believed he was doing the right thing. He was ensuring evolution. To me, he was the perfect next step in the mutant story.<ref name=CBR2009/>}}\n\nAlthough the character first appeared in 1986, he was retroactively said to have been present during previously published stories. The unnamed benefactor of the [[Living Monolith]] in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #17 (1985) was later identified as Apocalypse in disguise.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #376 (January 2000)</ref> ''Classic X-Men'' #25 revealed that years earlier, Apocalypse encountered the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]] and granted him superhuman power.\n\nDuring his run on ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]] planned a story to reveal that Apocalypse was the third Summers brother, a mysterious sibling to the mutants Cyclops and Havok. But Weinberg left the book before he could go along with his plan and the third Summers brother was revealed to be the mutant Gabriel Summers, aka [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QchZYEKr?url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archivedate=2007-07-26 |work=Comixfan Forums > Comixfan Discussions > Comixfan Columns |title=No Prisoners #3: The Third Summers Brother |publisher=Comixfan.com |date=December 22, 2003 |accessdate=2014-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApocalypse was the principal adversary in the mid-1980s ''[[X-Men]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (1986\u20131991), until being apparently killed at the climax of issue #68 (July 1991). Since then, the character has died and been resurrected several times thanks to his power and advanced alien technology. His name En Sabah Nur was revealed in Cable #6 (Dec 1993) and his [[birthplace]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) and the origin of his technology, were revealed in ''[[X-Force]]'' #37 (August 1994). According to Marvel, the name translates as \"The First One\" (although, in reality, the translation is considered grammatically incorrect, as it means \"The First/Morning Light\" [En-(\"The\") + Sabah- (\"Morning\") + Nur- (\"Light\")] ).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Apocalypse_%28En_Sabah_Nur%29 |title=Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) - Marvel Universe Wiki: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}</ref> It is later revealed in the origin story ''[[Rise of Apocalypse]]'' that he is possibly the first mutant (meaning, in this case, a human being born with the X-gene), born 5,000 years ago. The character gained greater popularity in 1995 when the storyline \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" featured an [[alternate timeline]] in which Apocalypse has conquered much of planet Earth.\n \nThe character was reincarnated in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #1 as a small boy with no memory of his previous incarnation. The boy was named Evan Sabahnur.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #1.

He was born with the mutant X-gene, and possibly the first living being on Earth to express it. Because of his grey skin and blue lips, his people abandoned him as an infant. He was rescued by Baal of the Sandstormers who saw the child's potential power and will to survive. Baal named him En Sabah Nur, which Marvel translates as \"The First One\". The Sandstormers lived by the credo of [[survival of the fittest]], believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life.<ref>Rise of Apocalypse #1</ref> It is also revealed during the Apocalypse Wars that, while still a young boy, En Sabah Nur was very generous and selfless, to the chagrin of Baal. A time-displaced Evan Sabah Nur and All-New X-Men Beast tried to save En Sabah Nur, but he allowed himself to be captured to help them escape.<ref>All New X-Men Vol. 2 Issue #11</ref>\n\nAround this time, the time-traveller [[Kang the Conqueror]] arrived in Egypt and assumed the identity of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]] and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, left behind by the deity-like aliens known as [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself [[Apocalypse]]. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.<ref>''Rise of Apocalypse'' #1-4</ref>\n\nIt is revealed in the series ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' that Apocalypse, at some point in the days of Ancient Egypt, joined forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield to successfully fend off a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] invasion. Also present were [[Imhotep]] and a man who was either the moon god called [[Khonsu|Khonshu]] or his first [[Moon Knight]] avatar/champion.<ref>''S.H.I.E.L.D'' #1</ref>\n\n===Early history===\nAs the millennia pass, Apocalypse travels around planet Earth, convincing civilizations that he is a [[deity]] (inspiring different myths as a result) and manipulating them into fighting wars. He justifies that this encourages \"growth, judgment, and destruction\".<ref>''X-Factor'' #24</ref> Apocalypse's progeny become the [[Clan Akkaba]]. Apocalypse encounters the near-immortal human offshoot race known as [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], primarily the members [[Ikaris]] and [[Sersi]], who refer to him as their \"Ancient Nemesis\".<ref>''New Eternals: Apocalypse Now!''</ref>  At different points, Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to enter periods of [[suspended animation]], leaving Clan Akkaba and Ozymandias to act in his stead.\n\nIn 1013 AD, Apocalypse seeks to destroy the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who he knows will cause him trouble in the future, according to information obtained from Rama-Tut,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #6 (2013)</ref> yet the plans are foiled by Odin. In the 12th century, Apocalypse encounters the Eternal Sersi again while awakening latent mutant powers in a crusader named Bennet du Paris, also known as [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].<ref>''Black Knight: Exodus''</ref> In 1459, Apocalypse defeats [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler)]] in Romania, who later becomes the vampire more popularly known as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Count Dracula]].<ref>''Apocalypse vs Dracula'' #1 (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1859, Apocalypse encounters British scientist Nathaniel Essex and learns more about the nature of mutants. Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to transform Essex into the superhuman being [[Mister Sinister]]. He then coerces Sinister and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] into aiding his plans for global conquest, but Sinister concludes that these plans are madness and betrays Apocalypse, forcing him back into hibernation.<ref>''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1\u20134</ref> In 1897, Count Dracula attacks the Clan Akkaba in revenge for his defeat at Apocalypse's hands, forcing the Clan to revive their master from suspended animation.

This plan brings Apocalypse into direct conflict with the first incarnation of X-Factor, when the team comprised the original X-Men.<ref>''X-Factor'' #5-6</ref>\n\nApocalypse then recruits mutants to serve as his personal guard, known as the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]].

Apocalypse, viewing him as a threat and realizing that Nathan's energy is the very energy that awoke him all those months earlier,<ref>''Cable'' #75</ref> sends his newly formed group, the Riders of the Storm, to abduct the Summers child. Apocalypse at this time had conquered the city of [[Attilan]], home of the [[Inhumans]], as well as enslaved part of its population. X-Factor, alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, attacks Apocalypse's lunar stronghold. Although Apocalypse is severely defeated, the young Nathan is infected with a [[techno-organic virus]] and is sent to the future with a woman named Askani to be cured.<ref>''X-Factor'' #65-68</ref>\n\nIn the future, Apocalypse has conquered the Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse's body had grown feeble:<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix'' #1</ref> he becomes aware of the young Nathan's presence in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone's stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan.<ref>''The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1-4</ref> Nathan grows up to become the warrior [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as [[Stryfe]]) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse's future domination of the planet.\n\nIn the present, Apocalypse is prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his Riders (now calling themselves The [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]), who inform their master that his Horsemen have kidnapped Cyclops and Jean Grey, supposedly under his instructions (in actuality, Mister Sinister, who was posing as Apocalypse).<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #14</ref> When attempting to rejuvenate himself again, Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe who had arrived in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. After a battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref>\n\nThe Dark Riders' new leader, [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Genesis]] (the adopted son of Cable, who had traveled to the present to ensure Apocalypse's rise and exact revenge on his father), plans to resurrect Apocalypse by sacrificing the lives of the people in villages neighboring Akkaba. During this time, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is held captive by Genesis, who attempts to restore Wolverine's lost [[adamantium]] skeleton and turn him into a Horseman as a gift for Apocalypse. Wolverine breaks free and kills Genesis along with nearly all of the Dark Riders. Genesis had built a [[sarcophagus]] with Apocalypse's likeness (which is empty,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #100</ref> since Apocalypse had already revived<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #19 (January 1995)</ref>).\n\n===Further schemes===\nAfter a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at his side and quickly learns of the present danger: [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #335 (August 1996)</ref> He observes the conflict between the psionic entity and Earth's heroes with [[Uatu the Watcher]], who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one who hated him the most, Cable.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #336 (September 1996)</ref> Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught will be most vulnerable through the [[astral plane]] and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse removes the captive [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the [[Invisible Woman]], who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.<ref>''Cable'' #35</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of the ''Onslaught'' saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the [[Hulk]] and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two separate entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards' [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|pocket universe]]. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk's nexus-energy to overcome the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against the New World Order, a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the planet. The New World Order in turn set the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and the [[Absorbing Man]] against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which the New World Order had obtained, destroying their headquarters.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #455-457</ref>\n\nThe Hellfire Club later awakens Apocalypse's long-hidden Harbinger from its deep sleep: originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to [[incubation period|incubate]] for 100 years. Apocalypse releases his Horseman (Caliban) and his scribe Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves, if they were to survive the coming events.<ref>''Cable'' #53</ref> Cable with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battles the Harbinger, but are unable to stop it.

Apocalypse launches an attack at [[San Francisco]], using a mentally controlled Deviant, [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]], now a gigantic monster, that the Eternals are forced to battle. Apocalypse is confronted by his centuries-old foe, Ikaris, who now is a [[Prime Eternal]]. Although Apocalypse defeats Ikaris, the Eternal still succeeds in destroying his ship and thwarting his plan.<ref>New Eternals #1: Apocalypse Now, February 2000</ref>\n\n===The Twelve===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Grey]] -->\n{{Main|Apocalypse: The Twelve}}\n[[Image:ApocalypseTwelve.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Apocalypse merges with Cyclops in ''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97 (February 2000).

The Twelve legend was in fact a ruse, orchestrated by Apocalypse himself: once the Twelve are assembled, Apocalypse intended to use them to transform himself into a deitylike entity beyond the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #377, 2000</ref> It is revealed at the end of this story arc, that Apocalypse's physical form has been burned out due to the vast amount of energies he has under his control, forcing him to wear a bio-armor (like his future counterpart) and now plans to use [[Nate Grey]] as a host body for him to move his energy and consciousness into. The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97</ref> While the merge is successful, Apocalypse's aim for unlimited power is not and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios (see [[Ages of Apocalypse]]). Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #98</ref>\n\nAn amnesiac and powerless cyborg Cyclops regains control of the merged form, but Apocalypse begins to re-emerge. Jean and Cable are alerted to his location in Egypt, where Jean in the end manages to free Cyclops by telepathically tearing out Apocalypse's essence from her husband's body, rendering Apocalypse in an incorporeal [[astral plane|astral]] form, which Cable apparently destroys using his Psimitar.<ref>''X-Men: The Search of Cyclops'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Xmen182vol.2.jpg|185px|thumb|left|''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182 (April 2006). Cover art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]\nIn the aftermath of the 2005 \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline, in which most of the mutants lost their powers, Apocalypse was revealed to be alive and well. The techno-organic virus, with which he long ago infected Cable, was revealed to be the means by which Apocalypse's spirit reconstituted itself. With only a drop of his blood into a vat of organs and blood, the virus rewrote the genetic code of the material within to form a body for Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #27</ref> Apocalypse awakes from a slumber in a tomb in Akkaba, recalling:<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #181</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Across the world\u2014helpless mutants slaughtered. Pogroms. Horror. ...Something has woken me from my slumber. Once, a sudden surge in worldwide mutant power stirred me from a similar sleep. Now\u2014a plummet in global mutant capacity\u2014has opened my eyes.</blockquote>\n\nApocalypse finds himself on a planet with its mutant population reduced to a fraction of what it had been, only a few hundred remaining out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable's hands. Reappearing inside a [[Sphinx]]-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182</ref> The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #183</ref> Bent on becoming the new [[messiah]] for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the [[United Nations]] in New York and issues an [[ultimatum]]: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #185</ref><ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book|last = Sanderson |first=Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City| publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, Apocalypse's horsemen are lost, Ozymandias betrays him, and he is forced to retreat by a combined assault of the X-Men and the Avengers. Ultimately, it is discovered that the Celestials ''lent'' their technology to Apocalypse, requiring as payment ''greater sufferings later''. He attempts to embrace death as an escape from his lifelong pact, only to find himself instantly resurrected and hearing a voice: \"''We cannot let you die. Not yet. It is time Apocalypse\u2026 it is time''\".<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #186</ref>\n\nIn a future timeline seen in the 2009 storyline \"[[Messiah War]]\", a greatly weakened Apocalypse is attacked by [[Stryfe]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], but he survives the attack. Afterward, Apocalypse contacts [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] in the future and begs him to kill him. Archangel refuses and instead hands over some of his techno organic wing blades to him, telling Apocalypse he no longer holds any control over him. Coming into contact with the blades rejuvenates Apocalypse and he offers to join forces with Archangel to kill Stryfe who is on the verge of killing X-Force, Cable, Bishop, as well as [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>''X-Force'' Vol.2 #15</ref> Archangel takes Apocalypse to a Celestial ship, where Apocalypse is then fully restored and wants to avenge what Stryfe did to him.<ref>''Cable #15''</ref> Just as Stryfe is on the verge of taking Hope for himself, Apocalypse and Archangel confront and defeat Stryfe. Apocalypse releases Hope into Cable's care, but says that he will return for her eventually. Apocalypse then drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol.2 #16</ref> Stryfe manages to escape and travels back in time to the present.<ref>Cable & X-Force #18</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn the 2010 \"[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]\" storyline, versions of Apocalypse and his Horsemen from a possible future appear in the Avengers Tower after Kang breaks time itself. After a fight with the Avengers, he and his Horsemen disappear.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref>\n\nApocalypse's followers, the [[Clan Akkaba]], manage to bring about Apocalypse's return, albeit in the form of a child they will indoctrinate. Upon learning of Apocalypse's return, X-Force seeks to kill him, but when they discover he is a child, Psylocke decides to protect him, believing they can rehabilitate him and train him as a force for good. To the shock of the rest of the team, Fantomex fatally shoots the child.<ref>\n[[Rick Remender]] (w), [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] (a). ''Uncanny X-Force'' #4 (March 2011).

The boy, code-named Genesis, helps X-force fight Archangel and when the battle is over, Fantomex enrolls him in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18-19</ref>\n\n====Evan Sabahnur====\nIn ''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #4 (March 2012), Evan Sabahnur a.k.a. Genesis is admitted as a student to the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, where his classmates notice his resemblance to Apocalypse. En is worried when a visiting [[Deathlok]], who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs him that this is what Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.<ref>[[Jason Aaron]] (w), [[Nick Bradshaw]] (a). \"Just Another Day in Westchester County\". ''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #4 (March 2012).

After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.<ref>''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #10. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nA new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] son [[Daken]], kidnaps Evan during a field trip to [[Genosha]]'s remains. Hoping to sway the boy into becoming Apocalypse, the Brotherhood reveals to him that he is a clone and tells him of X-Force's assassination of the child En Sabah Nur from which he was cloned and the falsehood of his life under the tutelage of [[Fantomex]]. After the Brotherhood reveals that they have killed Fantomex and further tortures Evan, Daken tells En that he has a choice: either immediately ascend as Apocalypse and kill the Brotherhood as revenge for the death of \"Uncle Cluster\", or let the rest of X-Force die at the Brotherhood's hands to avenge the death of the original boy En Sabah Nur and to prevent X-Force from killing Evan the way they killed Apocalypse and Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #25-35</ref>\n\nDaken offers Evan a suit of Apocalypse's Celestial armor to do with what he will, secretly planning to control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the [[Shadow King]]. After Deadpool's failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine's death at Daken's hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse's armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool will always be there for him when he needs him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #35. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater Deadpool enlists Evan and Quentin's help to help him saving his daughter Eleanor Camacho from the [[Flag-Smasher]], with Evan promising Quentin a bloodbath and some action to motivate him. He manages to save Ellie's life and proposes Deadpool to let Quentin erase from the girl's mind every memory of the ordeal. Deadpool loudly refuses and to Evan's surprise, he hugs him and tells him to stay in school.<ref>''Deadpool'' #33 (2014) Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the 2014 \"[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\" storyline, Evan is one of many mutants captured by the [[Red Skull]] on the island of Genosha.<ref>''Magneto'' (vol. 3) #9.

Marvel Comics</ref> In the energy released when the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Doctor Doom]] use the combined power of order and chaos spells to suppress the Red Skull's personality in favor of the sliver of Professor X's that still exists in his brain, Evan ascends to adulthood, stepping out of the rubble with a looming, muscular body and the presence and appearance of Apocalypse. Deadpool even comments on how changed Evan is. When [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and Cyclops argue with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and the new [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] over who should take custody of the body of Red Skull, Evan convinces the Summers brothers that Professor X is dead and they have other problems to deal with.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nActing as Apocalypse, 'En' vows to lead the mutants in an uprising, rallying the converted X-Men into helping him take Avengers Tower\u2014now disregarded by the inverted Avengers after they captured almost all other heroes using [[Pym particles]]\u2014to use as the site where he will detonate a Celestial-based 'gene-bomb' to wipe out all humans not carrying the X-gene.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6. Marvel Comics</ref> With only the inverted villains present at the original confrontation to oppose the inverted X-Men and Avengers, the gene bomb is nearly detonated,<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #7. Marvel Comics</ref> but is contained thanks to the sacrifice of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #8. Marvel Comics</ref> As Apocalypse broods on his failure, the decapitated Deadpool\u2014converted to a peaceful version of himself by the inversion\u2014convinces Apocalypse that now is the time to be heroic, proclaiming that nobody liked En Sabah Nur but everyone appreciated Evan, as he represented the hope that nurture could beat nature. Inspired by Deadpool's words, Apocalypse turns on the X-Men and the Avengers, allowing the Astonishing Avengers (along with non-inverted heroes Steve Rogers and [[Spider-Man]]) to retrieve the White Skull and undo the inversion. At the conclusion of the storyline, Evan is shown on the run with Deadpool.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Apocalypse Wars===\nDuring the Apocalypse Wars, the Extraordinary X-Men travel thousands of years into Earth's future in order to rescue Colossus and his team of young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse's rule as he functioned as the Omega World's heart, keeping it alive, while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #11</ref> Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undo the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. It's left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new host body.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #12</ref>\nApocalypse was kept at X-Haven, inside a cell specially built to contain him by Forge,<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #13</ref> and later after again retrieving Colossus, Forge tried to find a way to cure him by reverse engineering Apocalypse's powers but failed.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #14</ref> During the World-Eater's attack on Limbo, Nightcrawler agreed to free Apocalypse in exchange for a cure for his friend.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #15</ref> After returning Colossus to his normal self, Nightcrawler indeed released Apocalypse from his prison, however what Apocalypse didn't expect was that Nightcrawler would throw him into the vortex created by the World-Eater to consume Limbo, seemingly killing him in the process.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #16</ref>\n\n===Degeneration===\nApocalypse is later revealed to be back on Earth, no details about what the Celestials did to him were revealed, and is shown performing experiments to create an immortal vessel which he can then use as a host for his vast power and consciousness by utilizing a modified ancient Celestial technology known as the Finch, which can repair genetic decay. His efforts are not in vain, as he begins to impose his own consciousness onto a human test subject, the fourth attempt, lending it his own regenerative powers to withstand the assault. However, the test subject resists the process, causing a massive chain reaction that bathes Apocalypse and the subject in a wave of energy. Apocalypse's mind and body are torn apart. He finds his mind wandering to that of his birth before his being is fused, mixed, and exploded along with this human form. Once the wave subsides, Apocalypse finds himself in a strange new land that he deduces was the result of the explosion within the Celestial machine that must have caused a dimensional rift which threw him into another dimension. He also discovers that his body has changed as well. Not only does he discover that he can bleed, something that should be impossible with his injury-resistant mutant physiology, but after a fight against a resident of the twisted dimension, which he was able to defeat, Apocalypse learns that his body is actively refusing physiological mutation. Needing to breathe air for the first time in centuries, he comes to a shocking truth as he watches his hand turn from its usual mutated appearance back to a human form. He's becoming Human.<ref>''X-Men: Black - Magneto'' #1</ref> After degenerating into an ape form, he is taken out by his previous human test subjects who unlike him, had ascend in form after being empowered by Apocalypse's own DNA. He and other apes are tortured with the Finch, which was recovered and repaired by the human test subjects. When test subject D experiments on Apocalypse, he uses the last of his mutant power to try to transfer his mind into D and is finally able to possess him which restores Apocalypse to his former glory and realizes that he had not been transported to another planet, rather the earlier explosion from the Finch had simply evolved his entire South American island, infusing his superior genetics into everything the blast wave struck, transforming it into the tribulation which he had been forced to endure. Apocalypse then gave his perfect host body a trial run as he killed the remaining test subjects, while reducing the entire island to rubble that was reclaimed by the sea.<ref>''X-Men: Black - Emma Frost'' #1</ref>\n\nApocalypse was soon afterward captured by some mysterious force and is being held captive along with [[Kitty Pryde]] and anti-mutant senator Ashton Allen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #1</ref>\n===Dawn of X===\nApocalypse accepts Xavier's invite to enter Krakoa<ref>House of X #5</ref> and even is among the Quiet Council, a group of twelve powerful and experienced mutants who serve as the island's lawgivers. He takes up learning magic and acts as an advisor to the new Excalibur team.<ref>Excalibur #1 (2019)</ref> He appears to have devised a way to restore the powers of those who were depowered by Scarlet Witch's spell, but to do so, these ex-mutants need to prove themselves as worthy to get their powers back. Therefore Apocalypse created the \"Crucible\", a trial by combat to death, where the ex-mutant is expected to lose in order to pass all while Apocalypse goads them about the weakness the loss of their powers created.<ref>''X-Men'' #7</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nApocalypse is an ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with a variety of superhuman abilities who further augmented himself after merging with [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] technology. He is an immortal being,<ref>''X-Force'' (vol 1.) #37 (August 1994)</ref> with total control over the molecules of his body, enabling him to alter his form as it suits him,<ref>''X-Factor'' #6 (July 1986)</ref> such as allowing his body to become extremely malleable and flexible, enhance his physical abilities, transform his limbs into weapons, wings, or jets, regenerate from fatal injuries, generate a wide range of powers at will, and adapt his body to apparently any disease or hostile environment.<ref>''X-Factor'' #68 (1991)</ref> He can also project and absorb energy and is capable of [[technopathy]], being able to directly interface with the various technologies he has at his disposal. Thanks to the aid of his mutant abilities allowing him complete control over his body, special \"regeneration\" chambers,<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15 (December 1992)</ref> Celestial technology,<ref>''Heroic Age: X-Men'' (February 2011)</ref> and changing bodies, Apocalypse has further enhanced his abilities and now he can generate almost any mutant power at his will.\n\n{{Quote box\n|width = 40%\n|salign = right\n|author= [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]]\n|quote = So what\u2026 this guy's kind of like [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] on steroids?

Apocalypse is also a skilled [[demagogue]] and a master strategist.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #377</ref>\n\nApocalypse's blood can heal other mutants, but is fatal for humans. Apocalypse's blood can also restore his de-powered mutant descendants as is seen when a large dose of Apocalypse's blood regenerates the lost body part of [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and gave him a look similar to Apocalypse.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #9</ref>\n\nIn the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', his powers are portrayed slightly differently. Like most so-called \"Class 5 Mutants,\" Apocalypse is near-[[demigod|godlike]] in his abilities and their applications. Among his more aggressive powers is the apparent ability to create objects (including enormous buildings and structures but also clothing, weapons, armor, etc.) from [[dust]] within seconds and also to turn objects into dust, also within seconds. Another of his major powers is his ability to augment the powers of other mutants, a power he uses very selectively and chiefly as a means to recruit co-conspirators for his plans for [[world domination]]. The mutants whose powers he augments are sometimes taken with him as [[apprentice]]s and eventual [[acolyte]]s, and are treated as his children; however, even in such a role, a given mutant might suddenly be deemed unfit by Apocalypse and ejected from his confidence, at any time.\n\n==Other versions==\n[[File:Apocalypse AoA.jpg|185px|right|thumb|''Apocalypse'', as depicted in the pages of ''X-Men Alpha'' (February 1995), during the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline.

Marvel Comics.</ref> After completing a series of tasks, Sinister is transformed into Apocalypse who intends to conquer the planet. The heroes are unable to defeat him until the Phoenix Force appears and destroys him. Although his abilities are never directly stated in total, he is shown to be capable of negating other mutant powers, adapting mutant powers into his own by exposure to them and \"evolving\" as he is fought. Following a heavy assault by the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and SHIELD forces, he emerges from an explosion in a red and silver version of his traditional blue cybernetic battle armor. He is also capable of adapting to and overcoming Professor Xavier's psychic assault despite his training during his time in the future with Cable. Cable makes the most concrete implication that evolving is the major element of his powers when he remarks that Xavier must kill Apocalypse quickly before he adapts to his attacks and becomes immune to the telepathy.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #92. Marvel Comics.</ref> Apocalypse is finally dispelled by [[Jean Grey (comics)|Phoenix]]<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #93. Marvel Comics.</ref> while leaving an alive Mr. Sinister.

The Romans under [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] defended the border against these Parthian incursions successfully. However, in 40 BC a Parthian invasion force allied with rebel Roman forces who served under [[Quintus Labienus]] attacked the eastern Roman provinces, they enjoyed great success as Labienus took all of Asia Minor except for a few cities, while the young prince [[Pacorus I|Pacorus I of Parthia]] took over Syria and the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean state in Judea]].  After these incidents [[Mark Antony]] gave command of the eastern Roman forces to his lieutenant, [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]], a skilled military general who served under [[Julius Caesar]].  Ventidius landed unexpectedly on the coast of Asia Minor, which forced Labienus to fall back to Cilicia where he received additional Parthian reinforcements from Pacorus. After Labienus had regrouped with Pacorus\u2019s additional forces, his and Ventidius\u2019s armies met somewhere at the Taurus Mountains.<ref name=\"allempires.com\">http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=war_roman_parthian</ref>\n\n== The battle ==\nOn the day of battle, Ventidius positioned his men on the high slopes comprising rugged terrain in order to negate the Parthian strength in cavalry. Learning from general [[Lucius Decidius Saxa|Decidius Saxa]]'s errors in regards to his cavalry in the previous year, Ventidius decided not to waste them in a needless cavalry assault and instead kept his cavalry on the flanks of his infantry, which he planned to use to blunt the enemy attack. The Parthians had formed their cavalry in a loose formation outside their camp at the bottom of the hill with horse-archers at the front and [[cataphracts]] in the rear. Confident in their chances of success against the Romans, the Parthians failed to wait for Labienus' infantry to mobilise with them and instead surged up the hill to engage in combat with the Romans.\n\nThe Parthian horse-archers unleashed a volley of arrows at the Romans, who held their position and hid behind their shields. The Romans fought back by firing volleys of javelins at the Parthians. Eventually, Ventidius commanded his men into a close order formation and to charge down the hill towards their enemies with whom they collided. The Parthian horse-archers were lightly armoured and were not able to hold their own against the heavily armoured Roman legionnaires in close-quarters combat.  Eventually, due to the high losses, panic set in and the Parthian forces began to flee from the victorious Romans, leaving Labienus to his fate.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen. \"Mark Antony's Heroes\".

Countries may also have summits. Countries around the world share borders and form [[Continent|continents]] and subcontinents.\n\nThe largest country in the world is [[Russia]], while the most populated is [[China]]. The newest country is [[South Sudan]].\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n<!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: \"Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American).\" -->\n\nThe word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contr\u00e9e'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' (\"(land) lying opposite\"; \"(land) spread before\"), derived from ''contra'' (\"against, opposite\"). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.\n\nIn English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] \u2013 \"a country\" \u2013 through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or \"district, native land\".<ref>[[OED]], Country</ref> Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), \"[[Constable Country]]\" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the \"big country\" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), \"coal country\" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-0-19-861186-8}}</ref>\n\nThe equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English \"country\", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesl\u00e4nder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many \"pays\" that are officially recognized at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].\n\nA version of \"country\" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contr\u00e9e'', based on the word ''cuntr\u00e9e'' in [[Old French]],<ref name=\"oed\" /> that is used similarly to the word \"pays\" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.\n\n==Sovereignty status==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states}}\n\nThe term \"country\" can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of \"countries\" in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. By one application of the [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]], there are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]]; of which 193 are members of the [[United Nations]], two have observer status at the UN (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UN. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] since 2011.\n\nThe degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as [[French Polynesia]] or the [[British Virgin Islands]]), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct [[dependent territories]], are usually listed together with [[sovereign]] states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate \"[[country of origin]]\" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|title=Made In The British Crown Colony|work=Thuy-Tien Crampton|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075644/http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|title = Matchbox label, made in Hong Kong|work = delcampe.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20140401162502/http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html%23.UzroWH3LfK5#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|archive-date = 1 April 2014|df = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractortalk.com/f40/carrhart-made-hong-kong-27324/|title=Carrhart Made In Hong Kong?|work=ContractorTalk}}</ref>\n\nA few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries:\n\n* The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] includes four separate countries: [[Netherlands]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and [[Sint Maarten]].\n* The [[United Kingdom]] includes [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Crown Dependencies]], which are not part of the UK itself, are also sometimes referred to as countries.\n* The [[The unity of the Realm|Kingdom of Denmark]] includes three separate countries: [[Denmark]], [[Faroe Islands]], and [[Greenland]].\n\n==Country classification==\nSeveral organizations seek to identify trends in order to produce country classifications. Countries are often distinguished as [[Developing country|developing countries]] or [[Developed country|developed countries.]]\n\n'''The United Nations'''\n\nThe UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects'' report that classified states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income. Within the broad categories, the United Nations identified subgroups based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies as Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. \n\nThe UN additionally recognizes multiple trends that impact the developmental status of countries in the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects''. The report highlights fuel-exporting and fuel-importing countries, as well as small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. It also identifies heavily indebted poor countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Economic and Situation Prospects 2019 |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2019_BOOK-web.pdf |website=The United Nations |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''The World Bank'''\n\nThe World Bank also classifies countries based on GNI per capita. Using the ''World Bank Atlas method'', it classifies countries as low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.<ref>{{cite web |title=How does the World Bank classify countries? |url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries |website=The World Bank |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Countries|Geography}}\n* [[City network]]\n* [[Constituent state]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent]]\n* [[Lists of countries and territories]]\n* [[Micronation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--\n* Anderson, Benedict; 'Imagined Communities: Reflections On the origin and Spread of Nationalism'; London, Verso; 1991\n* Viotti, Paul R. and Kauppi, Mark V.; 'International Relations and World Politics \u2013 Security, Economy, Identity'; Second Edition; New Jersey, Prentice Hall; 2001\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15868439 Defining what makes a country] ''The Economist''\n\n==External links==\n{{sister project links|d=Property:P17}}\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html The CIA World Factbook]\n* [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ Country Studies] from the [[United States Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090108200417/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreigngovt.htm Foreign Information by Country] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080625035909/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreignalpha.htm Country & Territory Guides] from GovPubs at UCB Libraries\n* [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ United Nations statistics division]\n\n{{Lists of countries and territories by continent}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Countries| ]]\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{short description|Region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography}}\n[[File:Political Map of the World, June 2019.pdf|thumb|upright=2|2019 map showing countries with full recognition and some [[List of states with limited recognition|UN non-member states]]; some [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territories]] are not shown]]\n\nThe term '''country''' refers to a political state or nation or its territory.

Countries may also have summits. Countries around the world share borders and form continents and subcontinents.\n\nThe largest country in the world is [[Russia]], while the most populated is [[China]]. The newest country is [[South Sudan]].\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n<!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: \"Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American).\" -->\n\nThe word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contr\u00e9e'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' (\"(land) lying opposite\"; \"(land) spread before\"), derived from ''contra'' (\"against, opposite\"). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.\n\nIn English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] \u2013 \"a country\" \u2013 through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or \"district, native land\".<ref>[[OED]], Country</ref> Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), \"[[Constable Country]]\" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the \"big country\" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), \"coal country\" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-0-19-861186-8}}</ref>\n\nThe equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English \"country\", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesl\u00e4nder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many \"pays\" that are officially recognized at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].\n\nA version of \"country\" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contr\u00e9e'', based on the word ''cuntr\u00e9e'' in [[Old French]],<ref name=\"oed\" /> that is used similarly to the word \"pays\" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.\n\n==Sovereignty status==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states}}\n\nThe term \"country\" can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of \"countries\" in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. By one application of the [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]], there are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]]; of which 193 are members of the [[United Nations]], two have observer status at the UN (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UN. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] since 2011.\n\nThe degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as [[French Polynesia]] or the [[British Virgin Islands]]), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct [[dependent territories]], are usually listed together with [[sovereign]] states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate \"[[country of origin]]\" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|title=Made In The British Crown Colony|work=Thuy-Tien Crampton|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075644/http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|title = Matchbox label, made in Hong Kong|work = delcampe.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20140401162502/http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html%23.UzroWH3LfK5#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|archive-date = 1 April 2014|df = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractortalk.com/f40/carrhart-made-hong-kong-27324/|title=Carrhart Made In Hong Kong?|work=ContractorTalk}}</ref>\n\nA few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries:\n\n* The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] includes four separate countries: [[Netherlands]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and [[Sint Maarten]].\n* The [[United Kingdom]] includes [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Crown Dependencies]], which are not part of the UK itself, are also sometimes referred to as countries.\n* The [[The unity of the Realm|Kingdom of Denmark]] includes three separate countries: [[Denmark]], [[Faroe Islands]], and [[Greenland]].\n\n==Country classification==\nSeveral organizations seek to identify trends in order to produce country classifications. Countries are often distinguished as [[Developing country|developing countries]] or [[Developed country|developed countries.]]\n\n'''The United Nations'''\n\nThe UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects'' report that classified states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income. Within the broad categories, the United Nations identified subgroups based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies as Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. \n\nThe UN additionally recognizes multiple trends that impact the developmental status of countries in the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects''. The report highlights fuel-exporting and fuel-importing countries, as well as small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. It also identifies heavily indebted poor countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Economic and Situation Prospects 2019 |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2019_BOOK-web.pdf |website=The United Nations |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''The World Bank'''\n\nThe World Bank also classifies countries based on GNI per capita. Using the ''World Bank Atlas method'', it classifies countries as low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.<ref>{{cite web |title=How does the World Bank classify countries? |url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries |website=The World Bank |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Countries|Geography}}\n* [[City network]]\n* [[Constituent state]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent]]\n* [[Lists of countries and territories]]\n* [[Micronation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--\n* Anderson, Benedict; 'Imagined Communities: Reflections On the origin and Spread of Nationalism'; London, Verso; 1991\n* Viotti, Paul R. and Kauppi, Mark V.; 'International Relations and World Politics \u2013 Security, Economy, Identity'; Second Edition; New Jersey, Prentice Hall; 2001\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15868439 Defining what makes a country] ''The Economist''\n\n==External links==\n{{sister project links|d=Property:P17}}\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html The CIA World Factbook]\n* [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ Country Studies] from the [[United States Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090108200417/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreigngovt.htm Foreign Information by Country] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080625035909/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreignalpha.htm Country & Territory Guides] from GovPubs at UCB Libraries\n* [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ United Nations statistics division]\n\n{{Lists of countries and territories by continent}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Countries| ]]\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n", "name_user": "AX757", "label": "safe", "comment": "I just added a link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}
