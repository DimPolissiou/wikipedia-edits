The line, which had a network of approximately {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} of track, connected the docks of the [[Floating Harbour]] to the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] mainline at [[Bristol Temple Meads]]. Freight could be transported directly by waggons to [[Paddington Station]] in London. The railway officially closed in 1964.\n\nIn 1978, a [[heritage railway]] named the Bristol Harbour Railway was opened operated by [[Bristol Industrial Museum]]. It uses approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=}} of the preserved line that runs adjacent to the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]. The line is a very popular visitor attraction in the city.\n\n==Industrial line==\n[[File:Bristol RJD 9.jpg|thumb|left|The Harbour Railway on a 1911 Bristol railway map]]\nThe original Harbour Railway was a joint venture by the GWR and sister company the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]]/ The first part of the network opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. The route required a tunnel under [[St Mary Redcliffe]] church and a steam-powered bascule bridge across the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the line was extended by {{convert|1/2|mi}} to Wapping Wharf.\n\nIn 1897 a [[Private Act of Parliament]], the GWR was authorised to make a westwards connection between the Harbour Railway and the [[Portishead Railway]]. This created the West Loop at {{stnlnk|Ashton Gate}} which permitted southerly travel towards {{rws|Taunton}} and {{rws|Exeter St Davids}}. The connection also permitted the double the rail capacity to the [[Great Western main line]].<ref name = macd2>{{cite book|first=E. T.|last= MacDermot|title=The Great Western Railway|volume=2|publisher= Great Western Railway, London|year= 1931}}</ref> \n\nIn 1906 another authorised extension created new branches from the south via the [[Ashton Avenue Bridge|Ashton Swing Bridge]] to [[Canons Marsh]] on the north side of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut.\n\nIn 1964, the Harbour railway connection to Temple Meads was closed and the track lifted. The steam engine from the link's bascule bridge is now preserved at [[Bristol Museum]]. The following year, the Canons Marsh line closed. The branch from the Portishead line and Wapping marshalling yard to the Western Fuel Company continued remained open for commercial coal traffic for another 20 years. It was officially closed in 1987.\n\n==Heritage railway==\n{{Bristol Harbour Railway RDT|collapse}}\nIn 1978, the [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] reopened part of the line as preserved railway using locomotives built in Bristol and formerly used at [[Avonmouth Docks]]. At first, it connected the museum with the SS ''Great Britain'', but when commercial rail traffic ceased in 1987 on the remaining branch line, the museum railway expanded to use the branch alongside the [[New Cut (Bristol)|New Cut]]. However, when the [[Portishead Railway]] was relaid, this severed the connection to Ashton Junction.\n\nThe line now runs along the south side of [[Bristol Harbour]], starting at M Shed (the former [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4483|-2.5969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Prince Street end)}})}}), stopping at the {{SS|Great Britain}}, and ending at [[B Bond Warehouse]] (home of the CREATE Centre), one of the large tobacco warehouses beside [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4466|-2.6213|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Cumberland Basin end)}})}}.  The line follows the south side of the harbour the railway crosses [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], the narrow strip of land between the harbour and the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]\nThe former route east over the Swing Bridge is now the Pill Pathway [[rail trail]] and [[cycleway]].\n\nThe railway operates on selected weekends on [[standard gauge]] track over {{convert|1+1/2|mi}}. The railway runs along the south side of [[Bristol Harbour]], starting at M Shed (the former [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4483|-2.5969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Prince Street end)}})}}), stopping at the {{SS|Great Britain}}, and ending at [[B Bond Warehouse]] (home of the CREATE Centre), one of the large tobacco warehouses beside [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4466|-2.6213|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Cumberland Basin end)}})}}.\n\nIn 2006, [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] was closed and the site redeveloped into [[M Shed]] Museum of Bristol. The railway continues to operate between SS Great Britain Halt and the CREATE Centre, and in 2011 the railway became part of M Shed's working exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | title=M Shed Working Exhibits | work=Official M Shed Website | url=http://www.mshed.org/ }}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Bristol City Council, in partnership with other local councils in the area, proposed that the route of the railway should be used for a [[bus rapid transit]] route to serve the south-west of the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ashton Vale to Temple Meads rapid transit route consultation information  | work=West of England Partnership website | url=http://www.westofengland.org/transport/rapid-transit/ashton-vale---temple-meads-design-freeze-3 | accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> In early 2013, a review of alternative routes recommended a route along Cumberland Road, Commercial Road and Redcliff Hill as the best alternative. This change of route means that the rapid transit buses would no longer use the railway.\n\nCurrently (March 2017) the track and platform at Butterfly Junction (by the CREATE Centre) has been removed due to work on the Bristol Metrobus system.

The line, which had a network of approximately {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} of track, connected the docks of the [[Floating Harbour]] to the [[GWR]] mainline at [[Bristol Temple Meads]]. Freight could be transported directly by waggons to [[Paddington Station]] in London. The railway officially closed in 1964.\n\nIn 1978, a [[heritage railway]] named the Bristol Harbour Railway was opened operated by [[Bristol Industrial Museum]]. It uses approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=}} of the preserved line that runs adjacent to the [[River Avon]]. The line is a very popular visitor attraction in the city.\n\n==Industrial line==\n[[File:Bristol RJD 9.jpg|thumb|left|The Harbour Railway on a 1911 Bristol railway map]]\nThe original Harbour Railway was a joint venture by the GWR and sister company the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]]/ The first part of the network opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. The route required a tunnel under [[St Mary Redcliffe]] church and a steam-powered bascule bridge across the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the line was extended by {{convert|1/2|mi}} to Wapping Wharf.\n\nIn 1897 a [[Private Act of Parliament]], the GWR was authorised to make a westwards connection between the Harbour Railway and the [[Portishead Railway]]. This created the West Loop at {{stnlnk|Ashton Gate}} which permitted southerly travel towards {{rws|Taunton}} and {{rws|Exeter St Davids}}. The connection also permitted the double the rail capacity to the [[Great Western main line]].<ref name = macd2>{{cite book|first=E. T.|last= MacDermot|title=The Great Western Railway|volume=2|publisher= Great Western Railway, London|year= 1931}}</ref> \n\nIn 1906 another authorised extension created new branches from the south via the [[Ashton Avenue Bridge|Ashton Swing Bridge]] to [[Canons Marsh]] on the north side of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut.\n\nIn 1964, the Harbour railway connection to Temple Meads was closed and the track lifted. The steam engine from the link's bascule bridge is now preserved at [[Bristol Museum]]. The following year, the Canons Marsh line closed. The branch from the Portishead line and Wapping marshalling yard to the Western Fuel Company continued remained open for commercial coal traffic for another 20 years. It was officially closed in 1987.\n\n==Heritage railway==\n{{Bristol Harbour Railway RDT|collapse}}\nIn 1978, the [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] reopened part of the line as preserved railway using locomotives built in Bristol and formerly used at [[Avonmouth Docks]]. At first, it connected the museum with the SS ''Great Britain'', but when commercial rail traffic ceased in 1987 on the remaining branch line, the museum railway expanded to use the branch alongside the [[New Cut (Bristol)|New Cut]]. However, when the [[Portishead Railway]] was relaid, this severed the connection to Ashton Junction.\n\nThe line now runs along the south side of [[Bristol Harbour]], starting at M Shed (the former [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4483|-2.5969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Prince Street end)}})}}), stopping at the {{SS|Great Britain}}, and ending at [[B Bond Warehouse]] (home of the CREATE Centre), one of the large tobacco warehouses beside [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4466|-2.6213|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Cumberland Basin end)}})}}.  The line follows the south side of the harbour the railway crosses [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], the narrow strip of land between the harbour and the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]\nThe former route east over the Swing Bridge is now the Pill Pathway [[rail trail]] and [[cycleway]].\n\nThe railway operates on selected weekends on [[standard gauge]] track over {{convert|1+1/2|mi}}. The railway runs along the south side of [[Bristol Harbour]], starting at M Shed (the former [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4483|-2.5969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Prince Street end)}})}}), stopping at the {{SS|Great Britain}}, and ending at [[B Bond Warehouse]] (home of the CREATE Centre), one of the large tobacco warehouses beside [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4466|-2.6213|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bristol Harbour Railway (Cumberland Basin end)}})}}.\n\nIn 2006, [[Bristol Industrial Museum]] was closed and the site redeveloped into [[M Shed]] Museum of Bristol. The railway continues to operate between SS Great Britain Halt and the CREATE Centre, and in 2011 the railway became part of M Shed's working exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | title=M Shed Working Exhibits | work=Official M Shed Website | url=http://www.mshed.org/ }}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Bristol City Council, in partnership with other local councils in the area, proposed that the route of the railway should be used for a [[bus rapid transit]] route to serve the south-west of the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ashton Vale to Temple Meads rapid transit route consultation information  | work=West of England Partnership website | url=http://www.westofengland.org/transport/rapid-transit/ashton-vale---temple-meads-design-freeze-3 | accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> In early 2013, a review of alternative routes recommended a route along Cumberland Road, Commercial Road and Redcliff Hill as the best alternative. This change of route means that the rapid transit buses would no longer use the railway.\n\nCurrently (March 2017) the track and platform at Butterfly Junction (by the CREATE Centre) has been removed due to work on the Bristol Metrobus system. Trains can only run from outside the M Shed as far as Vauxhall Bridge.\n{{-}}\n\n===Rolling stock===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number and name\n! Built\n! Description\n! Current status\n! Livery\n!

The ISIL siege of the city lasted for almost 3 years and 2 months, after which the Syrian Army launched a [[Central Syria campaign (2017)|successful offensive]] that fully recaptured the city nine weeks later.\n\nIn April 2014, ISIL launched a [[Deir ez-Zor offensive (April\u2013July 2014)|large-scale offensive]] against Syrian rebel forces in Deir ez-Zor province. This resulted in the total defeat of rebel groups in the area, and ISIL gained control of almost all of [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]] in July 2014.

ISIL became increasingly involved in the battle. The following [[Inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War|rebel infighting]] in and near the city resulted in ISIL retreating from Deir ez-Zor in February 2014.\n\nIn April 2014, following their defeat at the hands of the rebels, ISIL returned and launched a large-scale offensive against the Syrian rebel groups in the Deir ez-Zor Province, expelling them from the area, and allowing ISIL to gain control of most of the Deir ez-Zor Governorate and besiege the remaining Syrian Government forces, in July 2014.\n\n== The siege ==\n=== 2014: Offensives and counter-offensives ===\n{{Main|Deir ez-Zor clashes (2011\u20132014)|Deir ez-Zor offensive (December 2014)}}\nFrom early to mid-September 2014, ISIL made several unsuccessful attempts to breach the Deir ez-Zor military air base.

The ISIL siege of the city lasted for almost 3 years and 2 months, after which the Syrian Army launched a [[Central Syria campaign (2017)|successful offensive]] that fully recaptured the city nine weeks later.\n\nIn April 2014, ISIL launched a [[Deir ez-Zor offensive (April\u2013July 2014)|large-scale offensive]] against Syrian rebel forces in Deir ez-Zor province. This resulted in the total defeat of rebel groups in the area, and ISIL gained control of almost all of [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]] in July 2014.

ISIL became increasingly involved in the battle.
