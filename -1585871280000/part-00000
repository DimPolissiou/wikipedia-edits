The 26th season of ''Shortland Street'' began airing on 15 January 2018.\n\n==Dion Tai==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series         = Shortland Street\n|name           = Dion Tai\n|portrayer      = Sonny Tupu\n|introducer     = Maxine Fleming\n|first          = {{Start date|2018|01|23|df=y}}\n|last           = {{End date|2018|03|23|df=y}}\n|classification = [[List of Shortland Street characters|Former; recurring]]\n|brothers       = [[#Riki Tai|Riki Tai]]\n|occupation     = Rugby League player\n}}\n'''Dion Tai''', played by Sonny Tupu,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/shortland-street/cast/sonny-tupu|title=Sonny Tupu|website=www.tvnz.co.nz|access-date=2018-03-16}}</ref> made his first appearance on 23 January 2018.\n\nDion arrives at the hospital as a famous rugby league star for a charity photo shoot. Upon running into the star struck [[Jack Hannah (Shortland Street)|Jack]] (Reuben Milner), he shocked all by outwardly discriminating on him for his sexuality and appearing to flirt with [[Sass Warner]] (Lucy Lovegrove). However upon running into Jack again, it transpired that Dion himself was closeted gay and in fact attracted to Jack. The two began a casual relationship with Dion too afraid to come out due to his high-profile rugby league career. However, with the ultimatum offered of losing Jack, Dion came out on national television and the two entered a loving committed relationship. Shortly into the relationship Dion began having health problems and was devastatingly diagnosed with terminal melanoma. He retired from sport and despite initial hesitation, allowed Jack to nurse him; eventually dying in his arms. He consumed brownies laced with medicinal marijuana. Weeks after his death, Damo, who was dieting, consumed them, and became badly impaired with hallucinations.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Zoe Carlson==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series         = Shortland Street\n|name           = Zoe Carlson\n|portrayer      = Holly Shervey \n|introducer     = Maxine Fleming\n|first          = {{Start date|2018|04|09|df=y}} \n|last           = \n|classification = [[List of Shortland Street characters|Present; regular]]\n|occupation = Personal assistant<br />Receptionist\n|father = [[Nev Carlson]]\n|sisters = [[Kate Hannah]]<br />Nicole Kruse-Miller\n|nephews = [[Blue Nathan]]\n|relatives = [[Jack Hannah (Shortland Street)|Jack Hannah]]<br />[[Curtis Hannah]]\n}}\n'''Zoe Carlson''', played by Holly Shervey,<ref>{{cite web|title=Holly Shervey|url=http://lionrockmanagement.co.nz/actors/holly-shervey/|publisher=Lion Rock Management|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> made her first screen appearance on 9 April 2018. She initially stayed with Vinnie and Nicole's place, but when she overstayed her welcome, the couple tried to get rid of her, but when Zoe left bad reviews, it turned out that she is the younger sister of Kate Nathan. She was mismatched by Dawn to be Curtis' love interest, but Dawn has no idea that Zoe is Curtis' step-aunt. She got the PA job after Leanne was recovering from a broken wrist and Sass Warner moving to Italy to take care of Hawks, despite her lack of experience. She has developed feelings for Chris Warner. On the day when she was supposed to be fired from the job, she emotionally blackmailed Chris by disclosing her false cancer claim. Before Chris almost saw through her lies, Zoe managed to re-cover her story by saying her cancer is [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's Lymphoma]], which is a far more treatable form. Finn, however, is still warning his father to fire her regardless. After taking care of a terminal patient by reading to her, her guilt finally overwhelms her after she passes away. On 7 May, when she tried to show signs of her illness as she felt threatened by Chris hiring an accountant that can double as a PA, Damo forced Zoe to confess to Kate after Chris somewhat covered up for her. She managed to cover it up for an extra week because she was able to fundraise for extra funding. When Chris and Zoe finally announced their relationship, Zoe found out she was pregnant, when Chris had to rush to Shanghai as Zhilan, Chris' daughter-in-law, went into labour months early. Zoe and Kate also found out that Nicole Miller has been their half-sister all along when Neville Carlson, their father, found Leanne and tried to reconcile.\nHowever, after Chris Warner returned, Jarryd returned and demanded money from her, which Zoe lied about him being abusive towards her, so she rescinded her resignation, Te Rongopai and Nicole saw through Leanne's attempt to get her job back, so Zoe was reassigned to work alongside her on the reception desk, while the role of PA was filled by a young man with MBA, but he left for better offers.\n\nThe baby's scan shows that she is smaller than normal, and is later diagnosed to have high risk of [[Down syndrome|Down's Syndrome]]. Chris suggests Zoe has an abortion, thinking she will never cope, but Zoe is deeply offended. Chris blames himself for possibly passing his genes on due to him being an older father, but finally gives Zoe credit. After helping Finn get reinstated as a surgeon, the two admit feelings for each other while realising their relationship is a bad idea. Chris walks in on the pair after the second time they kiss, ending his relationship with Zoe and disowning Finn. After being thrown out of Chris' house, Zoe would be attacked by the [[List of Shortland Street characters (2018)#Ian Reid|Beechwood Beast]], being raped and brutally assaulted. Being admitted to Shortland Street, Zoe is told she has miscarried her baby.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Dylan Reinhart==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series         = Shortland Street\n|name           = Dylan Reinhart\n|portrayer      = [[Ryan O'Kane]]\n|introducer     = Maxine Fleming\n|first          = {{Start date|2018|04|18|df=y}} \n|last           =14th December 2018 \n|classification = [[List of Shortland Street characters|Present; recurring]]\n|occupation     = ED Consultant<br />GP\n|brothers       = [[Daniel Reinhart]]\n|wife           = Stephanie Reinhart (deceased)<br/>Julia Reynolds (deceased)<br/>[[Kylie Brown]] (2018-2020)\n}}             \n'''Dylan Reinhart''', played by [[Ryan O'Kane]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-guide/103240940/shortland-street-actor--a-doctor-at-last|title=Shortland Street actor - a doctor at last|website=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|language=en|access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> made his first appearance on 18 April 2018. He found a weakened Erin Landry when she left Vinnie's House without her son. After a clash with Kylie in the emergency room, she was introduced by the returning Julia as her husband, in which both are remarried. He was originally working as a GP in Central Hospital, having worked in the lower South Island, and previously attended university in [[University of Otago|Otago]] with [[Boyd Rolleston]] (Sam Bunkall) and was then was later hired as ED Consultant and GP, where his terms of contract were leaked by Zoe to the staff. He also seemingly undermined [[Harper Whitley]]'s (Ria Vandervis) authority over treatment plans, but he is proven to be correct afterward, angering Harper while starting a rivalry with Harper's husband [[Drew McCaskill|Drew]] (Ben Barrington). Dylan would be chastised by his sister-in-law [[Kylie Brown]] (Kerry-Lee Dewing) as well as hospital CEO [[Chris Warner]] (Michael Galvin) over paying for a poor patient's medical bills with his own money. After a tennis game at Dylan and Julia's mansion, Kylie would miscarry the child she was carrying and Dylan and Julia would agree for Julia to be Kylie and husband [[Frank Warner (Shortland Street)|Frank Warner]]'s (Luke Patrick) surrogate mother. However, around this time Dylan would confess his lustful feelings toward Kylie.\n\nDylan then finds Miranda, the sister of his ex-wife Cassidy and the two clash before Miranda departs, leaving Julia with an ominous warning about Dylan. Dylan would begin to snap and tell Julia he hated her and was after her sister shortly before he sabotaged Julia's seatbeat while driving one day and then killing her by crashing into a tree and fiddling with her life support system.\n\nDylan would begin to spend his insurance payout while showing a strange lack of grief towards the death of his wife which would irk and pique the curiosity of Frank and Dylan would begin to manipulate promiscuous nurse [[Dawn Robinson]] (Rebekah Palmer) into sleeping with him and then to dump her boyfriend [[Ali Karim]] (Tane Williams-Accra).\n\nDylan would go on a fishing excursion with Frank at Kylie's behest, having fantasies about murdering Frank the entire time. However, on 31 August, Frank paid off ex-gang member Skinny to scare off Dylan, which he went overboard and almost killed him, and Frank exacerbated by choking him half to death, when Dylan threatened to sue Frank. But in doing so, he can make Kylie leave Frank and be with Dylan, seeing he already dumped Dawn. In December, he engaged with Kylie, but the reappearance of his twin brother, Daniel, dug up the really bad past that tore the twins apart, as Daniel dated Dylan's ex-wife, Stephanie, who Dylan killed by car accident, similar way that Julia was killed.  In the lead-up to the 2018 Christmas cliffhanger, Dylan and Kylie embark on their honeymoon where partway through the drive, Kylie receives texts from Harper warning her about how Dylan killed his two previous wives, but it was too late for Kylie to realise Dan had been truthful all along about his plans to commit murder for insurance fraud. Kylie realized his plans and tried to kill her on the way to honeymoon. Kylie initially rescued him, but killed him off on the final episode of 2018 by asphyxiation.\n\nHe made sporadic returns in 2019 as Kylie's evil conscience before and after she married Dan.\n\n<br />\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Becky Reid==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series         = Shortland Street\n|name           = Becky Reid \n|portrayer      = Awhimai Fraser\n|introducer     = Maxine Fleming\n|first          = {{Start date|2018|04|24|df=y}} \n|last           = 28 September 2018\n|classification = [[List of Shortland Street characters|Present; recurring]]\n|occupation     = Nurse\n|husband        = [[#Tank Reid|Tank Reid]] (2018\u2013)\n}}\n'''Becky Reid''', played by Awhimai Fraser, made her first appearance on 24 April 2018.

It would then be revealed that Becky is the bride, with her husband being Curtis' police trainer, [[#Tank Reid|Tank Reid]] (Jack Barry). Panicking at first, the smitten Curtis would continue to pursue the married Becky, who also ended up being a nurse at Shortland Street.

However, just as Tank is about to have a final round of drinks with Curtis, he tears his right [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] and requires surgery. When Becky tries to end their marriage, Tank loses control and becomes extremely vengeful. Tank tries to test Curtis during the later fitness tests. When he finds out that Becky had an affair with Curtis, Tank lets him fall down the obstacle wall, but decides to help him finish his apprenticeship, provided Becky and Curtis never see each other again. Curtis graduates after Becky and Tank end their marriage. Tank suffers injuries after he has a driving accident. He recovers and returns when his father is admitted due to a heart attack.\n\nWith his father also feeling bad that Becky left Tank for an ex-con, Tank verbally abuses Curtis, while speaking ill of [[Pixie Hannah]] (Thomasin McKenzie), which causes the latter to snap. After the scuffle, Tank admits that his father put him up to it. Tank is prescribed [[diazepam]]. A day later, CCTV footage identifies him as being within the vicinity of an attack by the serial sex offender, the Beechwood Beast. Tank is taken in for questioning after Curtis and Darryl review the footage. However, the morning after [[#Zoe Carlson|Zoe Carlson]] (Holly Shervey) is raped, Curtis sees Tank hiding a mask, heightening his likelihood of being the sex offender, until [[Kate Hannah]] (Laurie Devenie) realises that he is covering for his father, [[#Ian Reid|Ian Reid]] (Phil Vaughan).

Te Rongopai pursued an agenda almost instantly, claiming such concepts as white privilege and nepotism, attempting to undermine things done by Chris in his time in charge, such as terminating the employment of Chris's son [[Frank Warner (Shortland Street)|Frank Warner]] (Luke Patrick) while favouring Maori members of staff by way of things such as giving Esther a paid working study program top further her skills as an emergency surgeon, while giving her time to heal her injuries inflicted upon her by another of Chris' sons, Esther's husband, disgraced former surgeon [[Finn Warner|Finn]] (Lukas Whiting), and introducing a free Maori Language tuition program. Te Rongopai's husband, [[List of Shortland Street characters (2018)#Pita Rameka|Pita]] (Jamie MacCaskill)  was the Maori Minister of Health, with much of his work happening in Wellington, where he looked after their daughter Rangimarie, herself a part-time activist.\n\nUpon Chris's return, Te Rongopai would stay on as a permanent second-in-charge of Shortland Street Hospital in the position of Chief Operating Officer.

Taking charge of the hospital again in Chris' absence, Te Rongopai would get into a relationship with Dr [[Boyd Rolleston]] (Sam Bunkall), but it did not last for long when she briefly got back with Pita just to keep Rangimarie happy.

However, with Drew's home detention due ot tax fraud, Te Rongopai became a non-clinical 2IC of Shortland Street by default.\n\nIn 2019, however, due to Drew being stood down, and Chris being injured from the plane accident, Te Rongopai resumed her role as acting CEO, where she met Hawks Logan for the first time, and tried to link him up with Ester, without knowing that he is already in a relationship with Sass.\n\nIn May 5, 2019, after breaking up with TK after he cheated on her to be with Kylie, she was stabbed in the abdomen my Charlie, who was on a meth-induced hallucination and rage.

She got the PA job after Leanne was recovering from a broken wrist and Sass Warner moving to Italy to take care of Hawks, despite her lack of experience. She has developed feelings for Chris Warner. On the day when she was supposed to be fired from the job, she emotionally blackmailed Chris by disclosing her false cancer claim. Before Chris almost saw through her lies, Zoe managed to re-cover her story by saying her cancer is [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's Lymphoma]], which is a far more treatable form. Finn, however, is still warning his father to fire her regardless. After taking care of a terminal patient by reading to her, her guilt finally overwhelms her after she passes away. On 7 May, when she tried to show signs of her illness as she felt threatened by Chris hiring an accountant that can double as a PA, Damo forced Zoe to confess to Kate after Chris somewhat covered up for her. She managed to cover it up for an extra week because she was able to fundraise for extra funding. When Chris and Zoe finally announced their relationship, Zoe found out she was pregnant, when Chris had to rush to Shanghai as Zhilan, Chris' daughter-in-law, went into labour months early. Zoe and Kate also found out that Nicole Miller has been their half-sister all along when Neville Carlson, their father, found Leanne and tried to reconcile.\nHowever, after Chris Warner returned, Jarryd returned and demanded money from her, which Zoe lied about him being abusive towards her, so she rescinded her resignation, Te Rongopai and Nicole saw through Leanne's attempt to get her job back, so Zoe was reassigned to work alongside her on the reception desk, while the role of PA was filled by a young man with MBA, but he left for better offers.\n\nThe baby's scan shows that she is smaller than normal, and is later diagnosed to have high risk of [[Down syndrome|Down's Syndrome]]. Chris suggests Zoe has an abortion, thinking she will never cope, but Zoe is deeply offended. Chris blames himself for possibly passing his genes on due to him being an older father, but finally gives Zoe credit. After helping Finn get reinstated as a surgeon, the two admit feelings for each other while realising their relationship is a bad idea. Chris walks in on the pair after the second time they kiss, ending his relationship with Zoe and disowning Finn. After being thrown out of Chris' house, Zoe would be attacked by the [[List of Shortland Street characters (2018)#Ian Reid|Beechwood Beast]], being raped and brutally assaulted.

However, on 31 August, Frank paid off ex-gang member Skinny to scare off Dylan, which he went overboard and almost killed him, and Frank exacerbated by choking him half to death, when Dylan threatened to sue Frank. But in doing so, he can make Kylie leave Frank and be with Dylan, seeing he already dumped Dawn. In December, he engaged with Kylie, but the reappearance of his twin brother, Daniel, dug up the really bad past that tore the twins apart, as Daniel dated Dylan's ex-wife, Stephanie, who Dylan killed by car accident, similar way that Julia was killed.  In the lead-up to the 2018 Christmas cliffhanger, Dylan and Kylie embark on their honeymoon where partway through the drive, Kylie receives texts from Harper warning her about how Dylan killed his two previous wives, but it was too late for Kylie to realise Dan had been truthful all along about his plans to commit murder for insurance fraud.

Initially released in Japan in 2010, it was later released in the PAL region in 2011 and then in North America in 2012. A port for the [[New Nintendo 3DS]] was released worldwide in April 2015, and a remaster for the [[Nintendo Switch]] is scheduled for a worldwide release in May 2020. ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is the first entry in the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, a subseries which forms part of the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' metaseries. Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous ''Xeno'' games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both [[Science fantasy|fantasy and science fiction]]. The game features navigation through an [[open world]] split into zones, side-quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real-time action-based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles'' takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a [[perpetual war]] with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist [[Shulk]] discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses.\n\nThe concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title ''Monado: The Beginning of the World'', though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first-timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans [[Yoko Shimomura]] and [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], with the latter writing the ending theme.\n\nThe game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role-playing games, while its New Nintendo 3DS port was praised for successfully re-creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A [[spiritual successor]] by the same development team for the [[Wii U]], ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', was released in 2015.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE--> A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', was released in 2017.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE-->\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Xenoblade-Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|Shulk (middle) and Reyn on the Bionis' Leg.

Item collection plays a role in the game in the form of the game's \"Collectopaedia\".<ref name=\"GRbeginner\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xenoblade-chronicles-beginners-guide/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles beginner's guide|last=Hughes|first=Matt|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=9 April 2012|accessdate=16 October 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dizdJZfx?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xenoblade-chronicles-beginners-guide/|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Scattered across the game are glowing blue orbs, and upon coming into contact with the orb, the player is awarded a random item that they can add to the Collectopaedia; when a certain number are collected, the player is rewarded with new items.<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/> Aside from the Collectopaedia, there are also ether crystals to be found from fallen enemies or ether crystal deposits, which give the player access to a multifaceted \"Gem Crafting\" mini-game, allowing for the creation of gems that may increase battle stats when equipped.<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/>\n\nMany in-game systems affect the general flow of gameplay. The \"Affinity\" system tracks the relationships between characters and locations in the game. \"Location Affinity\" tracks the [[interpersonal relationships]] between all of the game's named characters, depicting to which degree they get along with one another, and a town's general perception of the player's controllable party.<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/> Completing quests can alter perception of the characters, and open up additional story sequences.<ref name=\"siliconera.com\">{{cite web|last=Yip|first=Spencer|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/27/xenoblades-take-on-character-customization/|title=Xenoblade\u2019s Take On Character Customization|publisher=Siliconera|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=24 October 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6djG3ebrF?url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/27/xenoblades-take-on-character-customization/|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> There is also \"Party Affinity\", which is strictly the level of affection between each party member, ranging from [[Indifference (emotion)|indifference]] to [[love]].<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/> These affinities can be raised by having characters participate in battle together, giving gifts, or using the \"Heart-to-Heart\" system.<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/> These \"Heart-to-Hearts\" are intimate moments between two characters that can show more of a character's personality, history, or thoughts, and can be initiated by having a certain level of Affinity between them.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCallum|first=Greig|title=Xenoblade Chronicles|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Xenoblade/index.html|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=20 October 2011|date=28 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908010734/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Xenoblade/index.html|archivedate=8 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Affinity system ties into how efficient characters work together in battle and gem crafting.<ref name=\"GRbeginner\"/> The game also has an extensive customization system, which includes changing the characters' outfits and weapons.

Battle Arts are only available after a \"cool down\" period that occurs after every use, while character specific \"Talent Arts\" only become available after enough auto-attacks are executed.<ref name=\"ignwhy\"/> Both party members and enemies have a finite amount of [[health points]], and attacks deplete this value. Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP, but the game is lost if the player's character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived. Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player [[experience points]], which allows the characters to grow stronger by [[leveling up]] and learning new Arts. Arts for each character must be set by the player on their respective set up, called a  \"Battle Palette\", outside battles.<ref name=\"XenoManual\"/><ref name=\"1upbattle\">{{cite web|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|title=All About Xenoblade's Fighting System|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-fighting-system|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dizrYxf2?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-fighting-system|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other systems are present to affect the flow of battle. The \"Party Gauge\" slowly fills as party members successfully land hits on the enemy players, and filling the gauge allows the player to chain multiple attacks together, for extra damage.<ref name=\"1upbattle\"/> All party members have an \"aggro ring\" around them as well; the more actions a character performs, the larger it grows. Larger aggro rings lead enemies to focus their efforts on that respective character, leading to a strategic aspect of luring and diverting attention of enemies.<ref name=\"ignwhy\"/> Each character has a \"Tension\" gauge, which represents a character's morale: at its highest point, characters have a high probability of dealing a critical blow and less chance of missing an enemy.<ref name=\"XenoManual\"/> The game's \"Vision\" system, where main character [[Shulk]] can see glimpses of enemies' future attacks, also factors into battles. With knowledge of an enemy's potentially dangerous attack, the player can prevent it from happening by alerting a teammate, allowing the player to activate one of their Arts, or by using an Art of their own to stop the attack.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sahdev|first=Ishaan|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/23/see-xenoblades-vision-battle-system-in-action/|title=See Xenoblade's Vision Battle System In Action|publisher=Siliconera|date=23 May 2010|accessdate=24 October 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6djGA1Zrr?url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/23/see-xenoblades-vision-battle-system-in-action/|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Vision system is tied to the \"Party\" gauge, which is filled by boosting team morale, using Arts with special effects, and avoiding or dealing critical hits.

Egil and Meyneth attempt to fight Zanza, but they are defeated and Meyneth's Monado is stolen. As the party escapes, Egil attempts to fight once more, but Zanza destroys both him and the Mechonis.\n\nAfter the Mechonis' destruction, Zanza transforms the pure-blooded High Entia into Telethia, who purge Bionis of life.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Xenoblade Chronicles|developer=[[Monolith Soft]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1 September 2011|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Dickson''': It's just like she says.

Making their way to Prison Island, they defeat Lorithia and Dickson. The party then travels to face Zanza, who declares the life of Bionis as simply his food and vessels, and with both Monados, he intends to recreate the world as he has before, destroying the current world and both everyone and everything in it in the process.

Klaus's obsessive desires caused the experiment to end in disaster, obliterating the universe and causing Zanza and Meyneth to be reborn as gods.

Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on ''[[Xenogears]]'', then on the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy after founding Monolith Soft in 1999. ''Xenosaga'' was intended to be a six-part series, but low commercial performances forced the planned ''Xenosaga'' series to be halved.<ref name=\"USGxeno\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-the-xenoverse-got-its-groove-back|title=How the Xenoverse Got Its Groove Back|last=Mackey|first=Bob|website=[[Eurogamer|USGamer]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=9 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907022259/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-the-xenoverse-got-its-groove-back|archivedate=7 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After these events, the entire development team was in a state of low morale.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/> The initial concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', of people living on the bodies of gigantic gods, came to Takahashi in June 2006.

One of them, an executive called [[Yasuyuki Honne]], thought it would make a good 3D model and bought materials to create it.

Takahashi was responsible for creating the main concept, but as he was going to be director and executive producer, he was unable to also take on full script-writing duties, so he asked Takeda to be his partner in creating the scenario. Takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with Takahashi on adaptations of the [[Xenosaga Episode I|first ''Xenosaga'' game]], in addition to writing the script for ''[[Xenosaga I & II]]'', the [[Nintendo DS]] remake of ''Xenosaga'' and [[Xenosaga Episode II|its sequel]]. Takahashi deliberately chose someone outside the video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on the story's pacing.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Hattori was brought in during the early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for Nintendo games, which enabled her to look at Takahashi and Takeda's scenario from an objective viewpoint.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> A key element in the scenario was contrasting senses of scale, which Takahashi described as \"contrasting the realms of the micro and the macro\", while the main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey, and overcoming a predetermined future.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/><ref name=\"GI3dInterview\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|title=Interview: Inside The Development Of Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS|last1=Helgeson|first1=Matt|last2=Wallace|first2=Kimberley|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020200105/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|archivedate=20 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite multiple fantasy elements, ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is based within a science fiction premise, although such elements were kept low-key during the first part of the game.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref>{{cite book|date=24 July 2010|script-title=ja:\u30bc\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u3000\u30b6\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|trans-title=Xenoblade: The Complete Guide|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|page=285|isbn = 978-4-04-868841-3}}</ref>\n\nDespite their earlier work together, it was the first time Takahashi and Takeda were so intimately involved in a project. Takeda found working on the project more difficult than he initially anticipated: his standard writing form was for the anime series format, which was limited to 20-25 minute episodes. With ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression. Conversely, his previous experience enabled Takahashi to easily plan the structure and scheduling for the game. During the initial writing stages, Takahashi did not give precise instructions to Takeda: he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together, then they passed the developing script between themselves, along with producers Shingo Kawabata and Koh Kojima, to iron out rough elements. Takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch, something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> The ending underwent revisions: while Takahashi and Takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending, Hattori still felt unsatisfied. After a second look, Takahashi and Takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside the writing process, so they rewrote it to be more player-friendly.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> The final script contained a large amount of dialogue: the sheer volume, which included dialogue spoken in battle, made for a difficult experience while recording. Due to all the effort, Takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used, although he sometimes felt that there was too much. In the end, some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that the characters talked too much.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Takahashi's overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within the genre.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|title=Five Questions With Xenoblade Chronicles' Executive Director|last1=Juba|first1=Joe|last2=Kollar|first2=Phil|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215853/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|archivedate=4 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of the elements that was of great concern to both Takahashi and Takeda was the main protagonist Shulk. Takahashi had noticed that, in the majority of RPGs, the main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites. Consequently, one of the main priorities was to make Shulk as appealing as possible to players. During this process, it was suggested that Shulk be a [[silent protagonist]], but there was a general wish from the staff for him to speak. In addition to this, Takahashi needed to confront the problem faced in any RPG with voiced characters, which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them. The companion character Riki was cited by Takeda as a favorite of his: on paper Riki sounded an unlikable character, but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> One of the scenes where Hattori had input was a scene between Shulk and Fiora which showcased their connection: the original scene had Shulk touching Fiora's cheek, which Harrori felt would look \"creepy\" coming out of the blue. The scene was altered so Shulk touched her hand instead.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> One of the early concepts Takeda suggested was that one of the main protagonist's party would betray them and become the final boss, but Takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot what his original concept was, although the basic framework remained intact throughout.<ref name=\"SilDevelopment\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe original score for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' was composed by Manami Kiyota, ACE+ (a musical production group composed of Tomori Kudo, Hiroyo \"CHiCO\" Yamanaka, and Kenji Hiramatsu), and [[Yoko Shimomura]].<ref name=\"XenoLiners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles Original Soundtrack Liner Notes|publisher=Video Game Music Online|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604225053/http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|archivedate=4 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"1UPmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|title=Xenoblade's Music Dissected|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6de7p1XO1?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|archivedate=9 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As with other parts of development, Takahashi was deeply involved, constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for the game. He admitted that this was due to early samples he had given the team for his vision for the music, which they had followed too faithfully for his liking.

ACE+ was recommended to Takahashi by Dog Ear Records. Kiyota handled environmental tracks, while ACE+ was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces. The team's main goal was to create music that went beyond the typical sound of RPGs. In hindsight, Yamanaka attributed the harmony of the six composers' works to Takahashi's organization and overall direction.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiMusic\"/> The final score contained around ninety tracks. One of the hardest tracks for Shimomura was a nine-minute track that Takahashi requested to match with a movie scene. Later, he said the track needed to change midway through, essentially necessitating the creation of two conjoined themes.<ref name=\"1UPmusic\"/> The majority of the game's music was written by Kiyota and ACE+, with Shimomura writing eleven tracks.

They were requested for the job by Nintendo as the staff at Monolith Soft were already working on the next ''Xenoblade'' title.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref name=\"XenoGamespot\"/> Development on the port started between Autumn and Winter 2013 initially for the original [[Nintendo 3DS]], but initial testing showed that the original platform lacked the memory and power to effectively run the game, since the Wii's processing capabilities were greater than the regular 3DS. Hearing about the New 3DS, it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize the game's ambition.<ref name=\"XenoGamespot\" /> Its increased power made the port possible, and its button layout, with the inclusion of the ZL and ZR shoulder buttons and the C-Stick, meant that the original Wii Classic Controller button layout could be used without adjustment. As part of the alterations made to the title, much of the on-screen information was moved down to the bottom Touch screen so as to de-clutter the top screen, while the layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain the feel of the original as much as possible.<ref name=\"Nin3DSinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|title=Interview: Nintendo's Hiro Yamada On The Challenge Of Bringing Xenoblade Chronicles To The New Nintendo 3DS|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|website=Nintendo Life|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111202644/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|archivedate=11 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain [[frame rate]] and the seamless transitions between environments, unspecified \"technical tricks\" were used.

This entailed the creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex [[level of detail]] systems. All of the environments were rebuilt and optimized for the new system while keeping the original aesthetic intact.<ref name=\"GI3dInterview\"/> The reason given for porting the game to the New 3DS rather than the Wii U home console was that the length of the game could be intimidating for the modern gamer, who was becoming more used to on-the-go, quick gaming sessions.\n\n===''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition''===\nA high-definition remaster, ''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition'', was officially announced in September 2019 during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-is-getting-a-xenoblade-chronicles-/1100-6469644/ |title=Nintendo Switch Is Getting A Xenoblade Chronicles Remaster |first=Matt |last=Espineli |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=5 September 2019 |accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref> In addition to enhanced visuals, a rerecorded soundtrack, an updated user interface, and other quality-of-life improvements, ''Definitive Edition'' also includes a new [[epilogue]] scenario titled ''Future Connected'' which notably takes place on the Bionis's Shoulder, a region that was cut from the original release.

Initially released in Japan in 2010, it was later released in the PAL region in 2011 and then in North America in 2012. A port for the [[New Nintendo 3DS]] was released in 2015, and a remaster for the [[Nintendo Switch]] is scheduled to be released in 2020. ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is the first entry in the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, a subseries which forms part of the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' metaseries. Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous ''Xeno'' games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both [[Science fantasy|fantasy and science fiction]]. The game features navigation through an [[open world]] split into zones, side-quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real-time action-based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles'' takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a [[perpetual war]] with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist [[Shulk]] discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses.\n\nThe concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title ''Monado: The Beginning of the World'', though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first-timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans [[Yoko Shimomura]] and [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], with the latter writing the ending theme.\n\nThe game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role-playing games, while its New Nintendo 3DS port was praised for successfully re-creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A [[spiritual successor]] by the same development team for the [[Wii U]], ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', was released in 2015.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE--> A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', was released in 2017.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE-->\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Xenoblade-Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|Shulk (middle) and Reyn on the Bionis' Leg.

Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player [[experience points]], which allows the characters to grow stronger by [[leveling up]] and learning new Arts.

Egil and Meyneth attempt to fight Zanza, but they are defeated and Meyneth's Monado is stolen. As the party escapes, Egil attempts to fight once more, but Zanza destroys both him and the Mechonis.\n\nAfter the Mechonis' destruction, Zanza transforms the pure-blooded High Entia into Telethia, who purge Bionis of life.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Xenoblade Chronicles|developer=[[Monolith Soft]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1 September 2011|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Dickson''': It's just like she says.

Making their way to Prison Island, they defeat Lorithia and Dickson. The party then travels to face Zanza, who declares the life of Bionis as simply his food and vessels, and with both Monados, he intends to recreate the world as he has before, destroying the current world and both everyone and everything in it in the process.

Klaus's obsessive desires caused the experiment to end in disaster, obliterating the universe and causing Zanza and Meyneth to be reborn as gods.

One of them, an executive called [[Yasuyuki Honne]], thought it would make a good 3D model and bought materials to create it.

Takahashi was responsible for creating the main concept, but as he was going to be director and executive producer, he was unable to also take on full script-writing duties, so he asked Takeda to be his partner in creating the scenario. Takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with Takahashi on adaptations of the [[Xenosaga Episode I|first ''Xenosaga'' game]], in addition to writing the script for ''[[Xenosaga I & II]]'', the [[Nintendo DS]] remake of ''Xenosaga'' and [[Xenosaga Episode II|its sequel]]. Takahashi deliberately chose someone outside the video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on the story's pacing.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Hattori was brought in during the early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for Nintendo games, which enabled her to look at Takahashi and Takeda's scenario from an objective viewpoint.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> A key element in the scenario was contrasting senses of scale, which Takahashi described as \"contrasting the realms of the micro and the macro\", while the main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey, and overcoming a predetermined future.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/><ref name=\"GI3dInterview\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|title=Interview: Inside The Development Of Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS|last1=Helgeson|first1=Matt|last2=Wallace|first2=Kimberley|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020200105/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|archivedate=20 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite multiple fantasy elements, ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is based within a science fiction premise, although such elements were kept low-key during the first part of the game.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref>{{cite book|date=24 July 2010|script-title=ja:\u30bc\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u3000\u30b6\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|trans-title=Xenoblade: The Complete Guide|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|page=285|isbn = 978-4-04-868841-3}}</ref>\n\nDespite their earlier work together, it was the first time Takahashi and Takeda were so intimately involved in a project. Takeda found working on the project more difficult than he initially anticipated: his standard writing form was for the anime series format, which was limited to 20-25 minute episodes. With ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression. Conversely, his previous experience enabled Takahashi to easily plan the structure and scheduling for the game. During the initial writing stages, Takahashi did not give precise instructions to Takeda: he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together, then they passed the developing script between themselves, along with producers Shingo Kawabata and Koh Kojima, to iron out rough elements. Takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch, something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> The ending underwent revisions: while Takahashi and Takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending, Hattori still felt unsatisfied. After a second look, Takahashi and Takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside the writing process, so they rewrote it to be more player-friendly.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> The final script contained a large amount of dialogue: the sheer volume, which included dialogue spoken in battle, made for a difficult experience while recording. Due to all the effort, Takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used, although he sometimes felt that there was too much. In the end, some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that the characters talked too much.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Takahashi's overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within the genre.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|title=Five Questions With Xenoblade Chronicles' Executive Director|last1=Juba|first1=Joe|last2=Kollar|first2=Phil|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215853/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|archivedate=4 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of the elements that was of great concern to both Takahashi and Takeda was the main protagonist Shulk. Takahashi had noticed that, in the majority of RPGs, the main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites. Consequently, one of the main priorities was to make Shulk as appealing as possible to players. During this process, it was suggested that Shulk be a [[silent protagonist]], but there was a general wish from the staff for him to speak. In addition to this, Takahashi needed to confront the problem faced in any RPG with voiced characters, which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them. The companion character Riki was cited by Takeda as a favorite of his: on paper Riki sounded an unlikable character, but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> One of the scenes where Hattori had input was a scene between Shulk and Fiora which showcased their connection: the original scene had Shulk touching Fiora's cheek, which Harrori felt would look \"creepy\" coming out of the blue. The scene was altered so Shulk touched her hand instead.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> One of the early concepts Takeda suggested was that one of the main protagonist's party would betray them and become the final boss, but Takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot what his original concept was, although the basic framework remained intact throughout.<ref name=\"SilDevelopment\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe original score for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' was composed by Manami Kiyota, ACE+ (a musical production group composed of Tomori Kudo, Hiroyo \"CHiCO\" Yamanaka, and Kenji Hiramatsu), and [[Yoko Shimomura]].<ref name=\"XenoLiners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles Original Soundtrack Liner Notes|publisher=Video Game Music Online|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604225053/http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|archivedate=4 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"1UPmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|title=Xenoblade's Music Dissected|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6de7p1XO1?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|archivedate=9 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As with other parts of development, Takahashi was deeply involved, constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for the game. He admitted that this was due to early samples he had given the team for his vision for the music, which they had followed too faithfully for his liking.

ACE+ was recommended to Takahashi by Dog Ear Records. Kiyota handled environmental tracks, while ACE+ was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces. The team's main goal was to create music that went beyond the typical sound of RPGs. In hindsight, Yamanaka attributed the harmony of the six composers' works to Takahashi's organization and overall direction.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiMusic\"/> The final score contained around ninety tracks. One of the hardest tracks for Shimomura was a nine-minute track that Takahashi requested to match with a movie scene. Later, he said the track needed to change midway through, essentially necessitating the creation of two conjoined themes.<ref name=\"1UPmusic\"/> The majority of the game's music was written by Kiyota and ACE+, with Shimomura writing eleven tracks.

They were requested for the job by Nintendo as the staff at Monolith Soft were already working on the next ''Xenoblade'' title.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref name=\"XenoGamespot\"/> Development on the port started between Autumn and Winter 2013 initially for the original [[Nintendo 3DS]], but initial testing showed that the original platform lacked the memory and power to effectively run the game, since the Wii's processing capabilities were greater than the regular 3DS. Hearing about the New 3DS, it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize the game's ambition.<ref name=\"XenoGamespot\" /> Its increased power made the port possible, and its button layout, with the inclusion of the ZL and ZR shoulder buttons and the C-Stick, meant that the original Wii Classic Controller button layout could be used without adjustment. As part of the alterations made to the title, much of the on-screen information was moved down to the bottom Touch screen so as to de-clutter the top screen, while the layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain the feel of the original as much as possible.<ref name=\"Nin3DSinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|title=Interview: Nintendo's Hiro Yamada On The Challenge Of Bringing Xenoblade Chronicles To The New Nintendo 3DS|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|website=Nintendo Life|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111202644/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|archivedate=11 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain [[frame rate]] and the seamless transitions between environments, unspecified \"technical tricks\" were used.

This entailed the creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex [[level of detail]] systems. All of the environments were rebuilt and optimized for the new system while keeping the original aesthetic intact.<ref name=\"GI3dInterview\"/> The reason given for porting the game to the New 3DS rather than the Wii U home console was that the length of the game could be intimidating for the modern gamer, who was becoming more used to on-the-go, quick gaming sessions.\n\n===''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition''===\nA high-definition remaster, ''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition'', was announced in September 2019 during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-is-getting-a-xenoblade-chronicles-/1100-6469644/ |title=Nintendo Switch Is Getting A Xenoblade Chronicles Remaster |first=Matt |last=Espineli |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=5 September 2019 |accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref> In addition to enhanced visuals, updated controls, remixed music, and other quality-of-life improvements, ''Definitive Edition'' also includes a new [[epilogue]] titled ''Future Connected''.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort. CAPT. John N. Laycock created the Seabee's \"magic box\".  Todays [[Navy lighterage pontoon]] is a direct descendent of his creation.  \n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|\"NCDU 45\", CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort. CAPT. John N. Laycock created the Seabee's \"magic box\".  Todays [[Navy lighterage pontoon]] is a direct descendent of his creation.  \n\n\n \n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|\"NCDU 45\", CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

The station is owned by [[Allen Media Broadcasting]], a subsidiary of [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Entertainment Studios]]. WFFT's studios and transmitter are located on Hillegas Road in Fort Wayne.\n\n==History==\n\n===As an independent station===\nThe station signed on the air on December 21, 1977 as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]. Many shows on WFFT during its early days had not been seen in the [[media market|market]] since their original airing on network television; among the classic series it aired were ''[[Our Gang|The Little Rascals]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series|Batman]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' and ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. For a time, the station carried [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] shows that were preempted by [[WPTA]] (channel 21), which usually included shows that were part of the ''[[ABC Late Night]]'' block.\n\nIn January 1978, just one month after it signed on, the [[Midwestern United States]] suffered through a snowstorm known as the \"[[Great Blizzard of 1978]]\". Due to the severity of the storm, engineers were trapped at the station, and rather than sign off the air as they normally would, they got permission from management to simply continue transmitting. They filled the time with information about the weather situation (to the degree that they could given their limited resources), and [[public domain]] [[feature film|films]] and videos from the station's library. The appeal of 24-hour broadcasting was so popular, it would later end up staying on the air all night each Friday and Saturday on a regular basis during a time when the other Fort Wayne stations would sign-off for the night around 1:00 or 2:00&nbsp;a.m.; it filled the overnight timeslot with a feature film showcase called ''Nite Owl Theatre'', which began with the beginning refrain of \"[[(I've Been) Searchin' So Long]]\" by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] as its theme music.\n\nIn later years, Friday late nights featured classic [[horror film|horror movies]] such as: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolfman]]'', ''[[The Mole People (film)|The Mole People]]'' and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' hosted by a character called \"The Shroud\" on ''Nightmare Theatre'' (of which only one episode is currently known to exist<ref>{{cite web|title=WFFT TV-55 \u2013 Nightmare Theatre With The Shroud \u2013 1957\u2019s \u201cThe Deadly Mantis\u201d Broadcast (Circa-1980)|url=https://neovideohunter.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/wfft-tv-55-nightmare-theatre-with-the-shroud-1957s-the-deadly-mantis-broadcast-circa-1980/|website=The Northeast Ohio Video Hunter|date=March 20, 2015}}</ref>). The station provided a much-needed alternative to viewers in the Fort Wayne area (particularly younger viewers) with its array of cartoons, movies and old sitcoms. This was especially important for those who did not have cable and could not watch regional or national [[superstations]] such as [[WTTV]] from [[Indianapolis]] or [[WGN-TV]] from [[Chicago]].\n\nAt one time, WFFT was voted the #1 independent station in the United States, a feat that was especially remarkable since Fort Wayne was one of the smallest markets in the country at the time to have an independent station. Beginning in 1982, the station carried programming from [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN Headline News]] during various parts of the day, including the overnight hours on weekdays. It also provided some coverage of local events such as the [[Three Rivers Festival]]. The station also served as the official Fort Wayne outlet for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball. WFFT was also remembered for its ''[[Happy's Place]]'' and ''Froggy's Pad'' children's programs in the 1980s and 1990s. ''Happy's Place'' was known for its two-hour block of syndicated children's programs that initially aired from 3:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. During programming breaks, \"Happy the Hobo\" would emcee children's activities from the WFFT studios. Also on the broadcast were characters such as \"Froggy\", \"Chester T. Fox\" and \"Lawn Boy\". ''Froggy's Pad'' was a morning show spun off from ''Happy's Place'' that featured the raspy-voiced frog puppet presenting [[animated cartoon|animated]] shows.\n\n===Joining, leaving and rejoining Fox===\nWFFT became a charter affiliate of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] at the network's launch on October 6, 1986 and was branded as \"Super 55 Fox\" in the early to mid 1990's; the station would be carried on cable providers in the southeastern portion of the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] market during that time, as that region lacked a Fox affiliate until [[WSJV]] affiliated with network in October 1995. In the late-1990s, amidst the station's shift away from programming that was produced locally at its studios, the ''Happy's Place'' program was retooled. Segments were taped on location (and sometimes even in transit) and featured area attractions such as the [[Fort Wayne Children's Zoo]]. This format did not last long and the show was later cancelled. After this point, WFFT's programming apart from the Fox schedule was centered around syndicated fare including daytime [[talk show|talk]] and [[court show]]s, and reruns of network [[sitcom]]s. After the launch of [[UPN]] on January 16, 1995, WFFT began carrying the fledgling network through a secondary affiliation. The network's programming eventually moved to [[CBS]] affiliate [[WANE-TV]] (channel 15) full-time on a new second [[digital subchannel]] by the mid-2000s; when UPN and rival netlet [[The WB]] were shut down to form a combined network in 2006, WPTA gained the resulting [[The CW Plus|CW]] affiliation for its own subchannel. WFFT changed its on-air branding from \"Fox 55\" to \"Fox Fort Wayne\" on January 1, 2008 to reflect its various cable channel positions in the market.\n\nFox announced on June 20, 2011 that it would end its affiliation with WFFT and sister station KSFX-TV (now [[KOZL-TV]]) in [[Springfield, Missouri]]; its Fort Wayne affiliation moved to [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WISE-TV|WISE-DT2]] on August 1. Nexstar had earlier lost the Fox affiliation for [[WTVW]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]] following a dispute with the network over [[retransmission consent]] fees that it wanted its stations to pay to the network.<ref name=tvnc-wfftnofox>{{cite news|title=Fox Moves Afills In Springfield, Ft.

The last Fox program to air on WFFT was a repeat of ''[[American Dad!]]'' on July 31, 2011.\n\nOn July 25, 2011, [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] filed an antitrust lawsuit against [[Granite Broadcasting]], claiming that the company tried to monopolize advertising sales through its [[Local marketing agreement|shared services agreement]] with WPTA (owned by [[Malara Broadcast Group]]) and the five network affiliations shared between WPTA and WISE-TV (WPTA carries ABC on its primary channel and The CW on a second digital subchannel, while WISE-TV carries [[NBC]] on its primary channel as Fox and MyNetworkTV shared that station's second digital subchannel).

In 1980, it formed its initial news department and aired a half-hour prime time news program known as ''The 10 O\u2019Clock Report''; this was established during a time of heavy competition from other newscasts. As an independent, WFFT did not have network shows that could lead into its newscast, so consistent viewership and ratings were difficult to maintain. The news team consisted of only five people, and personnel would shoot and edit their own video.<ref>[http://www.fwdailynews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1487:WFFT%E2%80%99s-first,-short-lived-newscast&catid=69:derrick-gingery&Itemid=136 WFFT\u2019s first, short-lived newscast], ''[[Fort Wayne Daily News]]'', February 20, 2009</ref> After that broadcast's cancellation a year later, WFFT delivered news bulletins in prime time for almost two decades.\n\nOn April 6, 2009, the station launched its second news operation and prime-time broadcast known as ''Fox Fort Wayne News First at 10'' (now ''Fox 55 News First at 10'' since March 2018).

The station is owned by [[Allen Media Broadcasting]], a subsidiary of [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Entertainment Studios]]. WFFT's studios and transmitter are located on Hillegas Road in Fort Wayne.\n\n==History==\n\n===As an independent station===\nThe station signed on the air on December 21, 1977 as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]. Many shows on WFFT during its early days had not been seen in the [[media market|market]] since their original airing on network television; among the classic series it aired were ''[[Our Gang|The Little Rascals]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series|Batman]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' and ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. For a time, the station carried [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] shows that were preempted by [[WPTA]] (channel 21), which usually included shows that were part of the ''[[ABC Late Night]]'' block.\n\nIn January 1978, just one month after it signed on, the [[Midwestern United States]] suffered through a snowstorm known as the \"[[Great Blizzard of 1978]]\". Due to the severity of the storm, engineers were trapped at the station, and rather than sign off the air as they normally would, they got permission from management to simply continue transmitting. They filled the time with information about the weather situation (to the degree that they could given their limited resources), and [[public domain]] [[feature film|films]] and videos from the station's library. The appeal of 24-hour broadcasting was so popular, it would later end up staying on the air all night each Friday and Saturday on a regular basis during a time when the other Fort Wayne stations would sign-off for the night around 1:00 or 2:00&nbsp;a.m.; it filled the overnight timeslot with a feature film showcase called ''Nite Owl Theatre'', which began with the beginning refrain of \"[[(I've Been) Searchin' So Long]]\" by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] as its theme music.\n\nIn later years, Friday late nights featured classic [[horror film|horror movies]] such as: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolfman]]'', ''[[The Mole People (film)|The Mole People]]'' and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' hosted by a character called \"The Shroud\" on ''Nightmare Theatre'' (of which only one episode is currently known to exist<ref>{{cite web|title=WFFT TV-55 \u2013 Nightmare Theatre With The Shroud \u2013 1957\u2019s \u201cThe Deadly Mantis\u201d Broadcast (Circa-1980)|url=https://neovideohunter.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/wfft-tv-55-nightmare-theatre-with-the-shroud-1957s-the-deadly-mantis-broadcast-circa-1980/|website=The Northeast Ohio Video Hunter|date=March 20, 2015}}</ref>). The station provided a much-needed alternative to viewers in the Fort Wayne area (particularly younger viewers) with its array of cartoons, movies and old sitcoms. This was especially important for those who did not have cable and could not watch regional or national [[superstations]] such as [[WTTV]] from [[Indianapolis]] or [[WGN-TV]] from [[Chicago]].\n\nAt one time, WFFT was voted the #1 independent station in the United States, a feat that was especially remarkable since Fort Wayne was one of the smallest markets in the country at the time to have an independent station. Beginning in 1982, the station carried programming from [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN Headline News]] during various parts of the day, including the overnight hours on weekdays. It also provided some coverage of local events such as the [[Three Rivers Festival]]. The station also served as the official Fort Wayne outlet for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball. WFFT was also remembered for its ''[[Happy's Place]]'' and ''Froggy's Pad'' children's programs in the 1980s and 1990s. ''Happy's Place'' was known for its two-hour block of syndicated children's programs that initially aired from 3:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. During programming breaks, \"Happy the Hobo\" would emcee children's activities from the WFFT studios. Also on the broadcast were characters such as \"Froggy\", \"Chester T. Fox\" and \"Lawn Boy\". ''Froggy's Pad'' was a morning show spun off from ''Happy's Place'' that featured the raspy-voiced frog puppet presenting [[animated cartoon|animated]] shows.\n\n===Joining, leaving and rejoining Fox===\nWFFT became a charter affiliate of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] at the network's launch on October 6, 1986 and was branded as \"Super 55 Fox\" in the early to mid 1990's; the station would be carried on cable providers in the southeastern portion of the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] market during that time, as that region lacked a Fox affiliate until [[WSJV]] affiliated with network in October 1995. In the late-1990s, amidst the station's shift away from programming that was produced locally at its studios, the ''Happy's Place'' program was retooled. Segments were taped on location (and sometimes even in transit) and featured area attractions such as the [[Fort Wayne Children's Zoo]]. This format did not last long and the show was later cancelled. After this point, WFFT's programming apart from the Fox schedule was centered around syndicated fare including daytime [[talk show|talk]] and [[court show]]s, and reruns of network [[sitcom]]s. After the launch of [[UPN]] on January 16, 1995, WFFT began carrying the fledgling network through a secondary affiliation. The network's programming eventually moved to [[CBS]] affiliate [[WANE-TV]] (channel 15) full-time on a new second [[digital subchannel]] by the mid-2000s; when UPN and rival netlet [[The WB]] were shut down to form a combined network in 2006, WPTA gained the resulting [[The CW Plus|CW]] affiliation for its own subchannel. WFFT changed its on-air branding from \"Fox 55\" to \"Fox Fort Wayne\" on January 1, 2008 to reflect its various cable channel positions in the market.\n\nFox announced on June 20, 2011 that it would end its affiliation with WFFT and sister station KSFX-TV (now [[KOZL-TV]]) in [[Springfield, Missouri]]; its Fort Wayne affiliation moved to [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WISE-TV|WISE-DT2]] on August 1. Nexstar had earlier lost the Fox affiliation for [[WTVW]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]] following a dispute with the network over [[retransmission consent]] fees that it wanted its stations to pay to the network.<ref name=tvnc-wfftnofox>{{cite news|title=Fox Moves Afills In Springfield, Ft.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

He provides data that the viral waves hit the [[Central Powers]] before the Allied powers and that both [[morbidity]] and mortality in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] were considerably higher than in Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]].{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}\n\nThere are various theories of why the Spanish flu was \"forgotten\". The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n\n{{external media| float = right| width=230px |video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?465724-7/influenza-pandemic-world-war Presentation by Nancy Bristow on the Influenza Pandemic and World War I, November 1, 2019], [[C-SPAN]]}} \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

He provides data that the viral waves hit the [[Central Powers]] before the Allied powers and that both [[morbidity]] and mortality in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] were considerably higher than in Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]].{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}\n\nThere are various theories of why the Spanish flu was \"forgotten\". The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n\n{{external media| float = right| width=230px |video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?465724-7/influenza-pandemic-world-war Presentation by Nancy Bristow on the Influenza Pandemic and World War I, November 1, 2019], [[C-SPAN]]}} \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

Initially, Pilkington was solely the programme's producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to frequently invite him to make a [[cameo appearance]], Pilkington's quirky persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main presenter of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime devoted to his unusual thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two [[BBC 6 Music]] shows for [[Nemone]], and co-presented the shows with [[Russell Brand]].\n\n===Celebrity===\nPilkington's presence on ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' podcasts significantly increased his fame. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the victim of Gervais' [[practical joke]]s. After Pilkington said, \"I could eat a knob at night\" on the podcast (in relation to ''[[I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity]]'' contestants [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Bushtucker trial|eating a kangaroo penis]]), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the [[sound bite]] and mix it into [[dance music]]. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkington's quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. [[Reuters]], commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a \"phenomenon\" who had made \"[[Internet meme|Internet history]]\".<ref>{{cite web|date=August 2004 |url=http://www.rickygervais.com/karlisacult.php |title=Ricky Gervais... Obviously |publisher=Rickygervais.com |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 November 2010, while appearing live on [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]]'s [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while [[grout]]ing his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11815230 | work=BBC News | title=Ricky Gervais makes a surprise call to Karl Pilkington | date=22 November 2010}}</ref> \n\nPilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows ''[[Flipside TV]]'' and ''[[The Culture Show]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204012546/http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=Releaselog &#124; RLSLOG.net \u00bb The Culture Show S08E03 WS PDTV XviD-REMAX |publisher=RLSLOG.net |accessdate=18 March 2010 }}</ref> and appeared in several short films as part of the [[Channel 4]] project ''3 Minute Wonders''.\n\nMerchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkington's persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be \"ashamed\" if the radio show was scripted, and added that \"I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station\".<ref>Pilkington, K. (Producer) & Merchant, S., Gervais, R. (Presenters). (June 2005)</ref> Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series' worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' concluded that Pilkington's persona is genuine.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655386/The-idiot-philosopher.html |title=The idiot philosopher|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=28 May 2012 | date=17 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Television and DVD===\nPilkington appeared in an interview on Ricky Gervais's live stand-up comedy DVD, ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]''.

While there, he unintentionally caused [[Gail Porter]] to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington defended as an attempt to encourage improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html |title=Karl Pilkington: Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Conned Me Into TV Show - On The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show - Video |publisher=Absolute Radio |accessdate=26 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002183231/http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html |archivedate= 2 October 2013 }}</ref> After several years he began work on ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]''. Initially, Pilkington was solely the programme's producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to frequently invite him to make a [[cameo appearance]], Pilkington's quirky persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main presenter of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime devoted to his unusual thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two [[BBC 6 Music]] shows for [[Nemone]], and co-presented the shows with [[Russell Brand]].\n\n===Celebrity===\nPilkington's presence on ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' podcasts significantly increased his fame. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the victim of Gervais' [[practical joke]]s. After Pilkington said, \"I could eat a knob at night\" on the podcast (in relation to ''[[I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity]]'' contestants [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Bushtucker trial|eating a kangaroo penis]]), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the [[sound bite]] and mix it into [[dance music]]. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkington's quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. [[Reuters]], commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a \"phenomenon\" who had made \"[[Internet meme|Internet history]]\".<ref>{{cite web|date=August 2004 |url=http://www.rickygervais.com/karlisacult.php |title=Ricky Gervais... Obviously |publisher=Rickygervais.com |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 November 2010, while appearing live on [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]]'s [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while [[grout]]ing his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11815230 | work=BBC News | title=Ricky Gervais makes a surprise call to Karl Pilkington | date=22 November 2010}}</ref> \n\nPilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows ''[[Flipside TV]]'' and ''[[The Culture Show]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204012546/http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=Releaselog &#124; RLSLOG.net \u00bb The Culture Show S08E03 WS PDTV XviD-REMAX |publisher=RLSLOG.net |accessdate=18 March 2010 }}</ref> and appeared in several short films as part of the [[Channel 4]] project ''3 Minute Wonders''.\n\nMerchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkington's persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be \"ashamed\" if the radio show was scripted, and added that \"I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station\".<ref>Pilkington, K. (Producer) & Merchant, S., Gervais, R. (Presenters). (June 2005)</ref> Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series' worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' concluded that Pilkington's persona is genuine.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655386/The-idiot-philosopher.html |title=The idiot philosopher|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=28 May 2012 | date=17 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Television and DVD===\nPilkington appeared in an interview on Ricky Gervais's live stand-up comedy DVD, ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]''.
