Some astronauts are affected more than others. Earth-based research has demonstrated that sleep loss poses risks to astronaut performance, and that there are large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss point to an underlying genetic component. Indeed, data suggest that common genetic variations ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults.  Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space.<ref name=Goel>{{cite journal|last=Goel|first=Namni|author2=Dinges, David F.|title=Predicting risk in space: Genetic markers for differential vulnerability to sleep restriction|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=77|pages=207\u2013213|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.04.002|pmid=23524958|bibcode=2012AcAau..77..207G|pmc=3602842|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Computer-based simulation information==\n[[Mathematical and theoretical biology|Biomathematical]] models are being developed to instantiate the biological dynamics of sleep need and circadian timing.

Some astronauts are affected more than others. Earth-based research has demonstrated that sleep loss poses risks to astronaut performance, and that there are large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss point to an underlying genetic component. Indeed, data suggest that common genetic variations ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults.  Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space.<ref name=Goel>{{cite journal|last=Goel|first=Namni|author2=Dinges, David F.|title=Predicting risk in space: Genetic markers for differential vulnerability to sleep restriction|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=77|pages=207\u2013213|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.04.002|pmid=23524958|bibcode=2012AcAau..77..207G|pmc=3602842|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Computer-based simulation information==\n[[Mathematical and theoretical biology|Biomathematical]] models are being developed to instantiate the biological dynamics of sleep need and circadian timing.

Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world.\n\nIn the Bible, [[Jesus]] is recorded as instructing the apostles to make [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of all nations ({{bibleref|Matthew|28:19\u201320}}, {{bibleref|Mark|16:15\u201318}}). This verse is referred to by Christian missionaries as the [[Great Commission]] and inspires missionary work.\n\n====Historic====\n[[File:Rugendas - Aldea des Tapuyos.jpg|thumb|Village of Christianized Tapuyos Indians, [[Brazil]] c. 1820]]\nThe Christian Church expanded throughout the [[Roman Empire]] already in New Testament times and is said by tradition to have reached even further, to Persia ([[Church of the East]]) and to India ([[Saint Thomas Christians]]). During the Middle Ages, the Christian [[monasteries]] and missionaries such as [[Saint Patrick]] (5th century), and [[Adalbert of Prague]] (ca 956-997) propagated learning and religion beyond the European boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In 596, Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (in office 590-604) sent the [[Gregorian Mission]] (including [[Augustine of Canterbury]]) into England. In their turn, Christians from Ireland (the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]) and from Britain ([[Saint Boniface]] (ca 675-754), and the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], for example)  became prominent in converting the inhabitants of central Europe.\n\nDuring the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the Americas and in other Western colonies through the [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]], and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] to spread Christianity in the New World and{{clarify|date=August 2014}} to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and other indigenous people. About the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] (1506\u20131552) as well as other [[Jesuits]], Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans reached Asia and the [[Far East]], and the Portuguese sent missions into Africa. Emblematic in many respects is  [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China from 1582, which was totally peaceful and non-violent. These missionary movements should be distinguished from others, such as the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries, which were arguably compromised in their motivation by designs of military conquest.\n\n[[File:The Reception of the Rev. J. Williams, at Tanna, in the South Seas, the Day Before He Was Massacred, 1841 (B-088-015).jpg|thumb|English missionary [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], active in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]]]\nMuch contemporary Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962-1965, with an increased push for indigenization and [[inculturation]], along with  [[social justice]] issues as a constitutive part of preaching the Gospel.\n\nAs the [[Catholic Church]] normally organizes itself along territorial lines and had the human and material resources, religious orders, some even specializing in it, undertook most missionary work, especially in the era after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. Over time, the [[Holy See]]  gradually established a normalized Church structure in the mission areas, often starting with special jurisdictions known as apostolic prefectures and [[apostolic vicariates]]. At a later stage of  development these foundations are raised to regular diocesan status with a local bishops appointed. On a global front, these processes were often accelerated in the later 1960s, in part accompanying political decolonization. In some regions, however, they are still in course.\n\nJust as the Bishop of Rome had jurisdiction also in territories later considered to be in the Eastern sphere, so the missionary efforts of the two 9th-century [[saints Cyril and Methodius]] were largely conducted in relation to the West rather than the East, though the field of activity was central Europe.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], under the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] undertook vigorous missionary work under the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This had lasting effects and in some sense is at the origin of the present relations of [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Constantinople]] with some sixteen Orthodox national churches including the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (both traditionally said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Andrew), the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] (said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Paul). The Byzantines expanded their missionary work in Ukraine after the [[Baptism of Rus'|mass baptism in Kiev]] in 988. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] had its origins in the conversion by Byzantine missionaries of the Serb tribes when they arrived in the Balkans in the 7th century. Orthodox missionaries also worked successfully among the Estonians from the 10th to the 12th centuries, founding the [[Orthodoxy in Estonia|Estonian Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Martires de elicura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Jesuits who were martyred by the [[Mapuche|Araucanian]] Indians in Elicura in 1612]]\n\nUnder the [[Russian Empire]] of the 19th century, missionaries such as [[Nikolay Ilminsky|Nicholas Ilminsky]] (1822\u20131891) moved into the subject lands and propagated Orthodoxy, including through [[Belarus]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church|Latvia]], [[Moldova]], [[Finnish Orthodox Church|Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chinese Orthodox Church|China]]. The Russian [[Nicholas of Japan|St. Nicholas of Japan]] (1836\u20131912) took Eastern Orthodoxy to [[Japanese Orthodox Church|Japan]] in the 19th century. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also sent missionaries to [[Alaska]] beginning in the 18th century, including Saint [[Herman of Alaska]] (died 1836), to minister to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] continued missionary work outside Russia after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], resulting in the establishment of many new dioceses in the [[diaspora]], from which numerous converts have been made in Eastern Europe, North America, and Oceania.\n\nEarly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries included [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and contemporary ministers including [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and Richard Bourne, who ministered to the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] natives who lived in lands claimed by representatives of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in the early 17th century. Quaker \"publishers of truth\" visited Boston and other mid-17th century colonies, but were not always well received.<ref>Selleck, D., discussed throughout Chapter 1, ''Quakers in Boston: 1656\u20131964'', Fleming & Son, Somerville, 1980.\n</ref>\n\nThe Danish government began the first organized Protestant mission work through its [[College of Missions]], established in 1714. This funded and directed [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]] missionaries such as [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg]] in [[Tranquebar]], India, and [[Hans Egede]] in [[Isle of Hope|Greenland]]. In 1732, while on a visit in 1732 to [[Copenhagen]] for the coronation of his cousin King [[Christian VI]], the [[Moravian Church]]'s patron Nicolas Ludwig, Count von [[Zinzendorf]], was very struck by its effects, and particularly by two visiting [[Kalaallit people|Inuit]] children converted by [[Hans Egede]]. He also got to know a slave from the [[Danish Virgin Islands|Danish colony]] in the [[West Indies]]. When he returned to [[Herrnhut]] in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], he inspired the inhabitants of the village{{spaced ndash}}it had fewer than thirty houses then{{spaced ndash}}to send out \"messengers\" to the slaves in the West Indies and to the [[Moravian missions in Greenland]]. Within thirty years, Moravian missionaries had become active on every continent, and this at a time when there were fewer than three hundred people in Herrnhut. They are famous for their selfless work, living as slaves among the slaves and together with the Native Americans, the Delaware (i.e., [[Lenni Lenape]]) and [[Cherokee]] Indian tribes. Today, the work in the former mission provinces of the worldwide Moravian Church is carried on by native workers. The fastest-growing area of the work is in [[Tanzania]] in Eastern Africa. The Moravian work in [[South Africa]] inspired [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and the founders of the British [[Baptist]] missions. {{As of | 2014}}, seven of every ten Moravians live in a former mission field and belong to a race other than Caucasian.\n\nMuch [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] mission work came about under the auspices of the [[United Society|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG, founded in 1701), the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS, founded 1799) and of the [[Intercontinental Church Society]] (formerly the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, originating in 1823).\n\n====Modern====\n[[File:Canyon of the Little Christians.jpg|thumb|The first recorded baptism in [[Alta California]]]]\n[[File:Mayerhoff.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A Christian missionary of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|Wisconsin Synod]] going to the [[Apache]]]]\n\nWith a dramatic increase in efforts since the 20th century, and a strong push since the ''Lausanne I: The International Congress on World Evangelization'' in Switzerland in 1974,<ref>http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620162513/http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722 |date=June 20, 2009 }}</ref> modern evangelical groups have focused efforts on sending missionaries to every ethnic group in the world. While this effort has not been completed, increased attention has brought larger numbers of people distributing [[Bible]]s, [[Jesus (1979 film)|Jesus videos]], and establishing [[evangelical]] churches in more remote areas.\n\nInternationally, the focus for many years in the later 20th century was on reaching every \"people group\" with Christianity by the year 2000. Bill Bright's leadership with Campus Crusade, the Southern Baptist [[International Mission Board]], The Joshua Project, and others brought about the need to know who these \"[[unreached people group]]s\" are and how those wanting to tell about the Christian God and share a Christian Bible could reach them. The focus for these organizations transitioned from a \"country focus\" to a \"people group focus\". (From \"What is a People Group?\" by Dr. Orville Boyd Jenkins:  A \"people group\" is an ethnolinguistic group with a common self-identity that is shared by the various members. There are two parts to that word: ethno and linguistic. Language is a primary and dominant identifying factor of a people group. But there are other factors that determine or are associated with ethnicity.)\n\n[[File:The missionary ship \"Duff\" arriving (ca. 1797) at Otaheite, lithograph by Kronheim & Co.jpg|thumb|left|The missionary ship ''Duff'' arriving at [[Tahiti]], c. 1797]]\nWhat can be viewed as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of cooperation and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their [[Gospel|gospel message]], but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort.\n\nOver the years, as indigenous churches have matured, the church of the [[Global South]] (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) has become the driving force in missions. Korean and African missionaries can now be found all over the world. These missionaries represent a major shift in church history. Another major shift in the form of modern missionary work takes shape in the conflation of spiritualism with contemporary military metaphors and practices. Missionary work as [[spiritual warfare]] is the latest iteration in a long-standing relationship between Christian missions and militarization. Despite the seeming opposition between the submissive and morally upstanding associations with prayer and dominating violence associated with militarism, these two spheres interact in a dialectical way -- they are entangled to produce one another.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McAlister |first1=Elizabeth |title=The militarization of prayer in America: white and Native American spiritual warfare |journal=Journal of Religious and Political Practice |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013130 |doi=10.1080/20566093.2016.1085239|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBrazil, Nigeria, and other countries have had large numbers of their Christian adherents go to other countries and start churches. These non-western missionaries often have unparalleled success; because, they need few western resources and comforts to sustain their livelihood while doing the work they have chosen among a new culture and people.\n\n{{main|London Missionary Society|Church Mission Society|China Inland Mission|Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|Baptist Missionary Society|Christianity in China}}\n[[File:Preaching from a Waggon (David Livingstone) by The London Missionary Society.jpg|thumb|[[David Livingstone]] preaching from a wagon]]\nOne of the first large-scale missionary endeavors of the British colonial age was the [[Baptist Missionary Society]], founded in 1792 as the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen.\n\nThe [[London Missionary Society]] was an [[evangelical]] organisation, bringing together from its inception both [[Anglican]]s and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s; it was founded in England in 1795 with missions in Africa and the islands of the South Pacific.

Many of the [[church planting|network of churches they established]] became the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\nIn 1809, the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews was founded, which pioneered mission amongst the Jewish people; it continues today as the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People]]. In 1865, the [[China Inland Mission]] was founded, going well beyond British controlled areas; it continues as the OMF, working throughout [[East Asia]].\n\n[[File:LDS name tags.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic black name tags of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]]]\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has an active [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary program]].

Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a [[Missionary Training Center]] (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people they live among.

[[James Anthony Walsh|Father James Anthony Walsh]], a priest from the heart of Boston, and [[Thomas Frederick Price|Father Thomas Frederick Price]], the first native North Carolinian ordained into the priesthood, recognized that through their differences, they were touched by the triumph of the human spirit and enriched by encountering the faith experience of others. This was the foundation of their mutual desire to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions.\n\nCountering arguments that the Church needed workers here, Fathers Walsh and Price insisted the Church would not flourish until it sent missioners overseas.<ref>[http://maryknollmissiontrips.org]</ref> Independently, the men had written extensively about the concept, Father Price in his magazine ''Truth'', and Father Walsh in the pages of ''A Field Afar'', an early incarnation of ''Maryknoll Magazine''.<ref>[http://www.maryknollmagazine.org/ ''Maryknoll Magazine'']</ref>  Together, they formulated plans to establish a seminary for foreign missionaries. With the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 to receive final approval from [[Pope Pius X]] for their project. On June 29, 1911, Pope Pius X gave his blessings for the formation of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, now better known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.<ref>[http://maryknollsociety.org Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers]</ref>\n\n===Islamic missions===\n{{main|Islamic missionary activity}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Mission Dawah.gif|Mission Dawah is one of the largest contemporary Islamic missionary organizations. \nFile:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - two worthies - DSCF8405.JPG|The tombs of historic Islamic missionaries in [[China]], Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun at Mount Lingshan, [[Quanzhou]]\n</gallery>\n\n[[Dawah]] means to \"invite\" (in Arabic, literally \"calling\") to [[Islam]], which is the second largest religion with 1.6 billion members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|title=The Global Religious Landscape|date=18 December 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> From the 7th century, it spread rapidly from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the rest of the world through the initial [[Muslim conquests]] and subsequently with traders and explorers after the death of [[Muhammad]].\n\nInitially, the spread of Islam came through the Dawah efforts of Muhammad and his followers. After his death in 632 C.E., much of the expansion of the empire came through conquest such as that of North Africa and later Spain ([[Al-Andalus]]). The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] put an end to the [[Sassanid Empire]] and spread the reach of Islam to as far east as [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which would later become the cradle of Islamic civilization during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (622-1258 C.E.) and a stepping-stone towards the introduction of Islam to the [[Turkic tribes]] living in and bordering the area.\n\nThe missionary movement peaked during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], with the expansion of foreign trade routes, primarily into the [[Indo-Pacific]] and as far south as the isle of [[Zanzibar]] as well as the South-Eastern shores of Africa.\n\nWith the coming of the [[Sufism]] tradition, Islamic missionary activities increased. Later, the [[Seljuk Turks]]' conquest of [[Anatolia]] made it easier for missionaries to go lands that formerly belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the earlier stages of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] form of [[Shamanism]] was still widely practiced in Anatolia, but soon lost ground to [[Sufism]].\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] presence in the [[Balkans]], missionary movements were taken up by people from aristocratic families hailing from the region, who had been educated in [[Constantinople]] or other major city within the Empire such as the famed [[madrassah]]s and [[kulliye]]s. Primarily, individuals were sent back to the place of their origin and were appointed important positions in the local governing body. This approach often resulted in the building of mosques and local [[kulliye]]s for future generations to benefit from, as well as spreading the teachings of Islam.\n[[File:World Islamic Mission 1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[World Islamic Mission]]'s mosque in [[Oslo]], Norway]]\n\nThe spread of Islam towards [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa had until the early 19th century has been consistent but slow. Previously, the only connection was through Trans-Saharan trade routes. The [[Mali Empire]], consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong example of the early Islamic conversion of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the [[Colonization of Africa|European colonization of Africa]], missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies.\n\nThere is evidence of Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia as early as the 8th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |title = Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World Vol. 2 M-Z index |author = Martin.

The spread of Islam into West Africa, beginning with ancient [[Ghana]] in the 9th century, was mainly the result of the commercial activities of North African Muslims. The empires of both [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] that followed ancient Ghana in the Western Sudan adopted the religion. Islam made its entry into the northern territories of modern Ghana around the 15th century. [[Mande languages|Mande]] speakers (who in Ghana are known as [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]]) traders and clerics carried the religion into the area. The northeastern sector of the country was also influenced by an influx of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] Muslim traders from the 16th century onwards\n\nIslamic influence first occurred in India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the [[Indian subcontinent]] from ancient times. Even in the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic era]], Arab traders used to visit the [[Malabar region]], which linked them with the ports of [[South East Asia|Southeast Asia]]. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book ''[[The History of India as told by its own Historians]]'', the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 C.E..

Judaism has never been a faith that seeks converts, because Judaism doesn't believe 'one must be Jewish to inherit everlasting life'. Jewish theology of the afterlife, reincarnation, Kingdom Age, Messiah, hell, heaven and even sin- are all understood very differently than other faiths. \n\nJudaism understands the [[God in Judaism|one true God]] to currently have covenantal relationships with both Jew and non-Jews.\n\nJews, they believe, are under The Covenant of Moses- and is binding on all Jews until the Moshiach (Messiah) appears in Jerusalem, and will bring shalom/peace to all humankind. \n\nNon-Jews (Gentiles, goyim, Children of The Nations) are under The Covenant of Noah- and is binding on all Nations until Moshiach (Messiah) gathers all humankind together. The Laws of Noah are the Seven Laws given to Noah once he and the other humans and animals \"were saved from the wrath of the flood\". \n\nIn The Bible, any \"Missionary Activity\" done by Jews to non-Jews was Jewish endeavors to bring pagan Nations into Covenant with God through Noah. Even non-Jewish prophets (such as Jonah) were sent out as Non-Jews to Non-Jews with the Noahide Covenant. This was  [[intertestamental|in Biblical times]], and contemporary [[Judaism]] remains clearly that missionary activities (to convert The Nations to Judaism) are taboo. Historically, various Judaic sects and movements have been consistent on avoiding [[proselytization]] to convert Gentiles.\n\nToday, Chabad Lubabvitch, a major player within Orthodox Judaism, has regained Jewish support for spreading The Covenant of Noah to All Nations with webpages geared to teaching Gentiles how to follow Noah, workshops led by Rabbis, and even opening actual congregations under The Noahide Covenant banner (Noahidic Congregation of Toronto, for example). Aish HaTorah, another Orthodox 'denomination', also has an entire division set up to preach The Laws of Torah to ALL Non-Jews. Some Jewish people even carry little 'Evangelical-style' tracts with them to give away to Non-Jews who ask them about Judaism.\n\nJewish religious groups encourage \"Outreach\" to [[Jew]]s. The outreach, or ''[[kiruv]]'', movements encourage Jews to become more knowledgeable and observant of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. People who become more observant are known as ''[[Baal teshuva|baalei teshuva]]''. \"Outreach\" is done worldwide, by organizations such as [[Chabad Lubavitch]], [[Aish Hatorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and [[Partners In Torah]]. There are also many such organizations in the United States. There has been a singular, isolated movement to convert Catholics to [[B'nai Moshe|Judaism in Peru]].\n\nMembers of the very liberal [[Reform Judaism|American Reform]] movement began a program to convert to their liberal brand of Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who have an interest in Reform Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during [[the Holocaust]] that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews<ref>[[Missionary#cite note-39]]</ref> as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices.\n\n===Baha'i pioneering===\n{{main|Pioneering (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Ten Year Crusade|`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's journeys to the West}}\n\n===Buddhist missions===\n[[File:Buddhism Growth in Hellenic World.png|alt=|thumb|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of king Ashoka (260\u2013218 BCE), according to his [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]]]]\n[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|[[Central Asia]]n [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] teaching a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] monk.

It was also taken into China brought by [[Kasyapa Matanga]] in the 2nd century CE, [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] and [[An Shigao]] translated Buddhist sutras into Chinese. [[Dharmarak\u1e63a]] was one of the greatest translators of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Dharmaraksa came to the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] in 266 CE, where he made the first known translations of the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Dasabhumika Sutra]], which were to become some of the classic texts of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Altogether, Dharmaraksa translated around 154 [[H\u012bnay\u0101na]] and [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] ''[[sutra]]s'', representing most of the important texts of Buddhism available in the Western Regions. His [[proselytizing]] is said to have converted many to Buddhism in China, and made [[Chang'an]], present-day [[Xi'an]], a major center of Buddhism. Buddhism expanded rapidly, especially among the common people, and by 381 most of the people of northwest China were Buddhist. Winning converts also among the rulers and scholars, by the end of the T'ang Dynasty Buddhism was found everywhere in China.<ref>Welty, Paul Thomas.

[[Seong of Baekje]], known as a great patron of [[Buddhism]] in [[Korea]], built many temples and welcomed priests bringing Buddhist texts directly from India. In 528, Baekje officially adopted Buddhism as its state religion. He sent tribute missions to Liang in 534 and 541, on the second occasion requesting artisans as well as various Buddhist works and a teacher. According to Chinese records, all these requests were granted. A subsequent mission was sent in 549, only to find the Liang capital in the hands of the rebel [[Hou Jing]], who threw them in prison for lamenting the fall of the capital. He is credited with having sent a mission in 538 to [[Japan]] that brought an image of [[Shakyamuni]] and several sutras to the Japanese court. This has traditionally been considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. An account of this is given in ''[[Gang\u014dji Garan Engi]]''.

Blavatsky]] and the [[Buddhist Society, London]] spread interest in Buddhism. Writers such as  [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Jack Kerouac]],   in the West, and the [[hippie]] generation of the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a re-discovery of Buddhism. During the 20th and 21st centuries Buddhism has again been propagated by missionaries{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} into the West such as the [[Dalai Lama]] and monks including [[Lama Surya Das]] (Tibetan Buddhism). [[Tibetan Buddhism]] has been significantly active and successful in the West since the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959.

Samprati, according to Jain historians, is considered more powerful and famous than Ashoka himself. Samprati built thousands of [[Jain Temples]] in India, many of which remain in use, such as the Jain temples at [[Viramgam]] and [[Palitana temples|Palitana]] (Gujarat), [[Agar Malwa]] ([[Ujjain]]). Within three and a half years, he got one hundred and twenty-five thousand new temples built, thirty-six thousand repaired, twelve and a half million murtis, holy statues, consecrated and ninety-five thousand metal [[murtis]] prepared. Samprati is said to have erected Jain temples throughout his empire. He founded Jain monasteries even in non-Aryan territory, and almost all ancient Jain temples or monuments of unknown origin are popularly attributed to him. It may be noted that all the Jain monuments of [[Rajasthan]] and Gujarat, with unknown builders are also attributed to Emperor Samprati.\n\n[[Virachand Gandhi]] (1864\u20131901) from [[Mahuva, Bhavnagar|Mahuva]] represented Jains at the first [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893 and won a silver medal.

Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world.\n\nIn the Bible, [[Jesus]] is recorded as instructing the apostles to make [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of all nations ({{bibleref|Matthew|28:19\u201320}}, {{bibleref|Mark|16:15\u201318}}). This verse is referred to by Christian missionaries as the [[Great Commission]] and inspires missionary work.\n\n====Historic====\n[[File:Rugendas - Aldea des Tapuyos.jpg|thumb|Village of Christianized Tapuyos Indians, [[Brazil]] c. 1820]]\nThe Christian Church expanded throughout the [[Roman Empire]] already in New Testament times and is said by tradition to have reached even further, to Persia ([[Church of the East]]) and to India ([[Saint Thomas Christians]]). During the Middle Ages, the Christian [[monasteries]] and missionaries such as [[Saint Patrick]] (5th century), and [[Adalbert of Prague]] (ca 956-997) propagated learning and religion beyond the European boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In 596, Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (in office 590-604) sent the [[Gregorian Mission]] (including [[Augustine of Canterbury]]) into England. In their turn, Christians from Ireland (the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]) and from Britain ([[Saint Boniface]] (ca 675-754), and the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], for example)  became prominent in converting the inhabitants of central Europe.\n\nDuring the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the Americas and in other Western colonies through the [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]], and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] to spread Christianity in the New World and{{clarify|date=August 2014}} to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and other indigenous people. About the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] (1506\u20131552) as well as other [[Jesuits]], Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans reached Asia and the [[Far East]], and the Portuguese sent missions into Africa. Emblematic in many respects is  [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China from 1582, which was totally peaceful and non-violent. These missionary movements should be distinguished from others, such as the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries, which were arguably compromised in their motivation by designs of military conquest.\n\n[[File:The Reception of the Rev. J. Williams, at Tanna, in the South Seas, the Day Before He Was Massacred, 1841 (B-088-015).jpg|thumb|English missionary [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], active in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]]]\nMuch contemporary Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962-1965, with an increased push for indigenization and [[inculturation]], along with  [[social justice]] issues as a constitutive part of preaching the Gospel.\n\nAs the [[Catholic Church]] normally organizes itself along territorial lines and had the human and material resources, religious orders, some even specializing in it, undertook most missionary work, especially in the era after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. Over time, the [[Holy See]]  gradually established a normalized Church structure in the mission areas, often starting with special jurisdictions known as apostolic prefectures and [[apostolic vicariates]]. At a later stage of  development these foundations are raised to regular diocesan status with a local bishops appointed. On a global front, these processes were often accelerated in the later 1960s, in part accompanying political decolonization. In some regions, however, they are still in course.\n\nJust as the Bishop of Rome had jurisdiction also in territories later considered to be in the Eastern sphere, so the missionary efforts of the two 9th-century [[saints Cyril and Methodius]] were largely conducted in relation to the West rather than the East, though the field of activity was central Europe.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], under the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] undertook vigorous missionary work under the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This had lasting effects and in some sense is at the origin of the present relations of [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Constantinople]] with some sixteen Orthodox national churches including the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (both traditionally said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Andrew), the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] (said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Paul). The Byzantines expanded their missionary work in Ukraine after the [[Baptism of Rus'|mass baptism in Kiev]] in 988. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] had its origins in the conversion by Byzantine missionaries of the Serb tribes when they arrived in the Balkans in the 7th century. Orthodox missionaries also worked successfully among the Estonians from the 10th to the 12th centuries, founding the [[Orthodoxy in Estonia|Estonian Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Martires de elicura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Jesuits who were martyred by the [[Mapuche|Araucanian]] Indians in Elicura in 1612]]\n\nUnder the [[Russian Empire]] of the 19th century, missionaries such as [[Nikolay Ilminsky|Nicholas Ilminsky]] (1822\u20131891) moved into the subject lands and propagated Orthodoxy, including through [[Belarus]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church|Latvia]], [[Moldova]], [[Finnish Orthodox Church|Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chinese Orthodox Church|China]]. The Russian [[Nicholas of Japan|St. Nicholas of Japan]] (1836\u20131912) took Eastern Orthodoxy to [[Japanese Orthodox Church|Japan]] in the 19th century. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also sent missionaries to [[Alaska]] beginning in the 18th century, including Saint [[Herman of Alaska]] (died 1836), to minister to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] continued missionary work outside Russia after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], resulting in the establishment of many new dioceses in the [[diaspora]], from which numerous converts have been made in Eastern Europe, North America, and Oceania.\n\nEarly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries included [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and contemporary ministers including [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and Richard Bourne, who ministered to the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] natives who lived in lands claimed by representatives of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in the early 17th century. Quaker \"publishers of truth\" visited Boston and other mid-17th century colonies, but were not always well received.<ref>Selleck, D., discussed throughout Chapter 1, ''Quakers in Boston: 1656\u20131964'', Fleming & Son, Somerville, 1980.\n</ref>\n\nThe Danish government began the first organized Protestant mission work through its [[College of Missions]], established in 1714. This funded and directed [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]] missionaries such as [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg]] in [[Tranquebar]], India, and [[Hans Egede]] in [[Isle of Hope|Greenland]]. In 1732, while on a visit in 1732 to [[Copenhagen]] for the coronation of his cousin King [[Christian VI]], the [[Moravian Church]]'s patron Nicolas Ludwig, Count von [[Zinzendorf]], was very struck by its effects, and particularly by two visiting [[Kalaallit people|Inuit]] children converted by [[Hans Egede]]. He also got to know a slave from the [[Danish Virgin Islands|Danish colony]] in the [[West Indies]]. When he returned to [[Herrnhut]] in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], he inspired the inhabitants of the village{{spaced ndash}}it had fewer than thirty houses then{{spaced ndash}}to send out \"messengers\" to the slaves in the West Indies and to the [[Moravian missions in Greenland]]. Within thirty years, Moravian missionaries had become active on every continent, and this at a time when there were fewer than three hundred people in Herrnhut. They are famous for their selfless work, living as slaves among the slaves and together with the Native Americans, the Delaware (i.e., [[Lenni Lenape]]) and [[Cherokee]] Indian tribes. Today, the work in the former mission provinces of the worldwide Moravian Church is carried on by native workers. The fastest-growing area of the work is in [[Tanzania]] in Eastern Africa. The Moravian work in [[South Africa]] inspired [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and the founders of the British [[Baptist]] missions. {{As of | 2014}}, seven of every ten Moravians live in a former mission field and belong to a race other than Caucasian.\n\nMuch [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] mission work came about under the auspices of the [[United Society|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG, founded in 1701), the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS, founded 1799) and of the [[Intercontinental Church Society]] (formerly the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, originating in 1823).\n\n====Modern====\n[[File:Canyon of the Little Christians.jpg|thumb|The first recorded baptism in [[Alta California]]]]\n[[File:Mayerhoff.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A Christian missionary of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|Wisconsin Synod]] going to the [[Apache]]]]\n\nWith a dramatic increase in efforts since the 20th century, and a strong push since the ''Lausanne I: The International Congress on World Evangelization'' in Switzerland in 1974,<ref>http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620162513/http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722 |date=June 20, 2009 }}</ref> modern evangelical groups have focused efforts on sending missionaries to every ethnic group in the world. While this effort has not been completed, increased attention has brought larger numbers of people distributing [[Bible]]s, [[Jesus (1979 film)|Jesus videos]], and establishing [[evangelical]] churches in more remote areas.\n\nInternationally, the focus for many years in the later 20th century was on reaching every \"people group\" with Christianity by the year 2000. Bill Bright's leadership with Campus Crusade, the Southern Baptist [[International Mission Board]], The Joshua Project, and others brought about the need to know who these \"[[unreached people group]]s\" are and how those wanting to tell about the Christian God and share a Christian Bible could reach them. The focus for these organizations transitioned from a \"country focus\" to a \"people group focus\". (From \"What is a People Group?\" by Dr. Orville Boyd Jenkins:  A \"people group\" is an ethnolinguistic group with a common self-identity that is shared by the various members. There are two parts to that word: ethno and linguistic. Language is a primary and dominant identifying factor of a people group. But there are other factors that determine or are associated with ethnicity.)\n\n[[File:The missionary ship \"Duff\" arriving (ca. 1797) at Otaheite, lithograph by Kronheim & Co.jpg|thumb|left|The missionary ship ''Duff'' arriving at [[Tahiti]], c. 1797]]\nWhat can be viewed as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of cooperation and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their [[Gospel|gospel message]], but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort.\n\nOver the years, as indigenous churches have matured, the church of the [[Global South]] (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) has become the driving force in missions. Korean and African missionaries can now be found all over the world. These missionaries represent a major shift in church history. Another major shift in the form of modern missionary work takes shape in the conflation of spiritualism with contemporary military metaphors and practices. Missionary work as [[spiritual warfare]] is the latest iteration in a long-standing relationship between Christian missions and militarization. Despite the seeming opposition between the submissive and morally upstanding associations with prayer and dominating violence associated with militarism, these two spheres interact in a dialectical way -- they are entangled to produce one another.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McAlister |first1=Elizabeth |title=The militarization of prayer in America: white and Native American spiritual warfare |journal=Journal of Religious and Political Practice |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013130 |doi=10.1080/20566093.2016.1085239|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBrazil, Nigeria, and other countries have had large numbers of their Christian adherents go to other countries and start churches. These non-western missionaries often have unparalleled success; because, they need few western resources and comforts to sustain their livelihood while doing the work they have chosen among a new culture and people.\n\n{{main|London Missionary Society|Church Mission Society|China Inland Mission|Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|Baptist Missionary Society|Christianity in China}}\n[[File:Preaching from a Waggon (David Livingstone) by The London Missionary Society.jpg|thumb|[[David Livingstone]] preaching from a wagon]]\nOne of the first large-scale missionary endeavors of the British colonial age was the [[Baptist Missionary Society]], founded in 1792 as the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen.\n\nThe [[London Missionary Society]] was an [[evangelical]] organisation, bringing together from its inception both [[Anglican]]s and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s; it was founded in England in 1795 with missions in Africa and the islands of the South Pacific.

It bent its efforts to the [[Coptic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Church]], and India, especially [[Kerala]]; it continues to this day. Many of the [[church planting|network of churches they established]] became the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\nIn 1809, the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews was founded, which pioneered mission amongst the Jewish people; it continues today as the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People]]. In 1865, the [[China Inland Mission]] was founded, going well beyond British controlled areas; it continues as the OMF, working throughout [[East Asia]].\n\n[[File:LDS name tags.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic black name tags of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]]]\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has an active [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary program]].

Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a [[Missionary Training Center]] (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people they live among.

[[James Anthony Walsh|Father James Anthony Walsh]], a priest from the heart of Boston, and [[Thomas Frederick Price|Father Thomas Frederick Price]], the first native North Carolinian ordained into the priesthood, recognized that through their differences, they were touched by the triumph of the human spirit and enriched by encountering the faith experience of others. This was the foundation of their mutual desire to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions.\n\nCountering arguments that the Church needed workers here, Fathers Walsh and Price insisted the Church would not flourish until it sent missioners overseas.<ref>[http://maryknollmissiontrips.org]</ref> Independently, the men had written extensively about the concept, Father Price in his magazine ''Truth'', and Father Walsh in the pages of ''A Field Afar'', an early incarnation of ''Maryknoll Magazine''.<ref>[http://www.maryknollmagazine.org/ ''Maryknoll Magazine'']</ref>  Together, they formulated plans to establish a seminary for foreign missionaries. With the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 to receive final approval from [[Pope Pius X]] for their project. On June 29, 1911, Pope Pius X gave his blessings for the formation of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, now better known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.<ref>[http://maryknollsociety.org Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers]</ref>\n\n===Islamic missions===\n{{main|Islamic missionary activity}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Mission Dawah.gif|Mission Dawah is one of the largest contemporary Islamic missionary organizations. \nFile:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - two worthies - DSCF8405.JPG|The tombs of historic Islamic missionaries in [[China]], Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun at Mount Lingshan, [[Quanzhou]]\n</gallery>\n\n[[Dawah]] means to \"invite\" (in Arabic, literally \"calling\") to [[Islam]], which is the second largest religion with 1.6 billion members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|title=The Global Religious Landscape|date=18 December 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> From the 7th century, it spread rapidly from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the rest of the world through the initial [[Muslim conquests]] and subsequently with traders and explorers after the death of [[Muhammad]].\n\nInitially, the spread of Islam came through the Dawah efforts of Muhammad and his followers. After his death in 632 C.E., much of the expansion of the empire came through conquest such as that of North Africa and later Spain ([[Al-Andalus]]). The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] put an end to the [[Sassanid Empire]] and spread the reach of Islam to as far east as [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which would later become the cradle of Islamic civilization during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (622-1258 C.E.) and a stepping-stone towards the introduction of Islam to the [[Turkic tribes]] living in and bordering the area.\n\nThe missionary movement peaked during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], with the expansion of foreign trade routes, primarily into the [[Indo-Pacific]] and as far south as the isle of [[Zanzibar]] as well as the South-Eastern shores of Africa.\n\nWith the coming of the [[Sufism]] tradition, Islamic missionary activities increased. Later, the [[Seljuk Turks]]' conquest of [[Anatolia]] made it easier for missionaries to go lands that formerly belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the earlier stages of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] form of [[Shamanism]] was still widely practiced in Anatolia, but soon lost ground to [[Sufism]].\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] presence in the [[Balkans]], missionary movements were taken up by people from aristocratic families hailing from the region, who had been educated in [[Constantinople]] or other major city within the Empire such as the famed [[madrassah]]s and [[kulliye]]s. Primarily, individuals were sent back to the place of their origin and were appointed important positions in the local governing body. This approach often resulted in the building of mosques and local [[kulliye]]s for future generations to benefit from, as well as spreading the teachings of Islam.\n[[File:World Islamic Mission 1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[World Islamic Mission]]'s mosque in [[Oslo]], Norway]]\n\nThe spread of Islam towards [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa had until the early 19th century has been consistent but slow. Previously, the only connection was through Trans-Saharan trade routes. The [[Mali Empire]], consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong example of the early Islamic conversion of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the [[Colonization of Africa|European colonization of Africa]], missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies.\n\nThere is evidence of Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia as early as the 8th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |title = Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World Vol. 2 M-Z index |author = Martin.

The spread of Islam into West Africa, beginning with ancient [[Ghana]] in the 9th century, was mainly the result of the commercial activities of North African Muslims. The empires of both [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] that followed ancient Ghana in the Western Sudan adopted the religion. Islam made its entry into the northern territories of modern Ghana around the 15th century. [[Mande languages|Mande]] speakers (who in Ghana are known as [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]]) traders and clerics carried the religion into the area. The northeastern sector of the country was also influenced by an influx of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] Muslim traders from the 16th century onwards\n\nIslamic influence first occurred in India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the [[Indian subcontinent]] from ancient times. Even in the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic era]], Arab traders used to visit the [[Malabar region]], which linked them with the ports of [[South East Asia|Southeast Asia]]. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book ''[[The History of India as told by its own Historians]]'', the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 C.E..

Judaism has never been a faith that seeks converts, because Judaism doesn't believe 'one must be Jewish to inherit everlasting life'. Jewish theology of the afterlife, reincarnation, Kingdom Age, Messiah, hell, heaven and even sin- are all understood very differently than other faiths. \n\nJudaism understands the [[God in Judaism|one true God]] to currently have covenantal relationships with both Jew and non-Jews.\n\nJews, they believe, are under The Covenant of Moses- and is binding on all Jews until the Moshiach (Messiah) appears in Jerusalem, and will bring shalom/peace to all humankind. \n\nNon-Jews (Gentiles, goyim, Children of The Nations) are under The Covenant of Noah- and is binding on all Nations until Moshiach (Messiah) gathers all humankind together. The Laws of Noah are the Seven Laws given to Noah once he and the other humans and animals \"were saved from the wrath of the flood\". \n\nIn The Bible, any \"Missionary Activity\" done by Jews to non-Jews was Jewish endeavors to bring pagan Nations into Covenant with God through Noah. Even non-Jewish prophets (such as Jonah) were sent out as Non-Jews to Non-Jews with the Noahide Covenant. This was  [[intertestamental|in Biblical times]], and contemporary [[Judaism]] remains clearly that missionary activities (to convert The Nations to Judaism) are taboo. Historically, various Judaic sects and movements have been consistent on avoiding [[proselytization]] to convert Gentiles.\n\nToday, Chabad Lubabvitch, a major player within Orthodox Judaism, has regained Jewish support for spreading The Covenant of Noah to All Nations with webpages geared to teaching Gentiles how to follow Noah, workshops led by Rabbis, and even opening actual congregations under The Noahide Covenant banner (Noahidic Congregation of Toronto, for example). Aish HaTorah, another Orthodox 'denomination', also has an entire division set up to preach The Laws of Torah to ALL Non-Jews. Some Jewish people even carry little 'Evangelical-style' tracts with them to give away to Non-Jews who ask them about Judaism.\n\nJewish religious groups encourage \"Outreach\" to [[Jew]]s. The outreach, or ''[[kiruv]]'', movements encourage Jews to become more knowledgeable and observant of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. People who become more observant are known as ''[[Baal teshuva|baalei teshuva]]''. \"Outreach\" is done worldwide, by organizations such as [[Chabad Lubavitch]], [[Aish Hatorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and [[Partners In Torah]]. There are also many such organizations in the United States. There has been a singular, isolated movement to convert Catholics to [[B'nai Moshe|Judaism in Peru]].\n\nMembers of the very liberal [[Reform Judaism|American Reform]] movement began a program to convert to their liberal brand of Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who have an interest in Reform Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during [[the Holocaust]] that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews<ref>[[Missionary#cite note-39]]</ref> as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices.\n\n===Baha'i pioneering===\n{{main|Pioneering (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Ten Year Crusade|`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's journeys to the West}}\n\n===Buddhist missions===\n[[File:Buddhism Growth in Hellenic World.png|alt=|thumb|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of king Ashoka (260\u2013218 BCE), according to his [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]]]]\n[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|[[Central Asia]]n [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] teaching a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] monk.

It was also taken into China brought by [[Kasyapa Matanga]] in the 2nd century CE, [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] and [[An Shigao]] translated Buddhist sutras into Chinese. [[Dharmarak\u1e63a]] was one of the greatest translators of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Dharmaraksa came to the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] in 266 CE, where he made the first known translations of the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Dasabhumika Sutra]], which were to become some of the classic texts of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Altogether, Dharmaraksa translated around 154 [[H\u012bnay\u0101na]] and [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] ''[[sutra]]s'', representing most of the important texts of Buddhism available in the Western Regions. His [[proselytizing]] is said to have converted many to Buddhism in China, and made [[Chang'an]], present-day [[Xi'an]], a major center of Buddhism. Buddhism expanded rapidly, especially among the common people, and by 381 most of the people of northwest China were Buddhist. Winning converts also among the rulers and scholars, by the end of the T'ang Dynasty Buddhism was found everywhere in China.<ref>Welty, Paul Thomas.

[[Seong of Baekje]], known as a great patron of [[Buddhism]] in [[Korea]], built many temples and welcomed priests bringing Buddhist texts directly from India. In 528, Baekje officially adopted Buddhism as its state religion. He sent tribute missions to Liang in 534 and 541, on the second occasion requesting artisans as well as various Buddhist works and a teacher. According to Chinese records, all these requests were granted. A subsequent mission was sent in 549, only to find the Liang capital in the hands of the rebel [[Hou Jing]], who threw them in prison for lamenting the fall of the capital. He is credited with having sent a mission in 538 to [[Japan]] that brought an image of [[Shakyamuni]] and several sutras to the Japanese court. This has traditionally been considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. An account of this is given in ''[[Gang\u014dji Garan Engi]]''.

Blavatsky]] and the [[Buddhist Society, London]] spread interest in Buddhism. Writers such as  [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Jack Kerouac]],   in the West, and the [[hippie]] generation of the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a re-discovery of Buddhism. During the 20th and 21st centuries Buddhism has again been propagated by missionaries{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} into the West such as the [[Dalai Lama]] and monks including [[Lama Surya Das]] (Tibetan Buddhism). [[Tibetan Buddhism]] has been significantly active and successful in the West since the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959.

Samprati, according to Jain historians, is considered more powerful and famous than Ashoka himself. Samprati built thousands of [[Jain Temples]] in India, many of which remain in use, such as the Jain temples at [[Viramgam]] and [[Palitana temples|Palitana]] (Gujarat), [[Agar Malwa]] ([[Ujjain]]). Within three and a half years, he got one hundred and twenty-five thousand new temples built, thirty-six thousand repaired, twelve and a half million murtis, holy statues, consecrated and ninety-five thousand metal [[murtis]] prepared. Samprati is said to have erected Jain temples throughout his empire. He founded Jain monasteries even in non-Aryan territory, and almost all ancient Jain temples or monuments of unknown origin are popularly attributed to him. It may be noted that all the Jain monuments of [[Rajasthan]] and Gujarat, with unknown builders are also attributed to Emperor Samprati.\n\n[[Virachand Gandhi]] (1864\u20131901) from [[Mahuva, Bhavnagar|Mahuva]] represented Jains at the first [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893 and won a silver medal.

Because a Cloake board either contains or is used with a queen excluder, the laying queen will be restricted to the lower hive body from this point forward. Frames containing larvae should be moved to the upper box to encourage nurse bees to come up, these will be needed to attend to the future queen cells. At this time the lower entrance to the hive is reversed so that it faces the opposite direction and then closed. Without the slide in floor in place, the Cloake Board functions as an upper entrance for workers, who re-orient to enter the hive using the upper entrance.\n\n===Stage two===\nSlide in the metal divider (insert): By sliding the divider into the Cloake board, the single functioning colony is now divided into two parts \u2013 a queenright lower colony and a queenless upper colony. The lower entrance is re-opened, allowing bees in the queenright section to exit the hive. When those bees return, they will do so to the upper entrance, but not be able to enter the lower colony. This results in a higher population of bees in the upper colony. The upper colony is typically left alone for 24 hours for a settling period, in which the bees determine that they are queenless, and prepare to replace their missing queen.\n\n===Stage three===\nGrafted cells Installed: The queenless upper colony is now prepared to raise queens, and by inserting queen rearing bars with grafted larvae, the beekeeper provides candidates for new queens. At this time any emergency queen cells will be removed by the beekeeper. Stage three continues for one to two days, long enough for the cells to be fully accepted and built up.\n\n===Stage four===\nRejoin colonies as a \"Finisher\": The slide-in-divider is removed from the Cloake board. The queen excluder continues to retain the laying queen in the lower colony while the combined colony incubates the grafted queens. The queen cells will be removed before they hatch and transferred to mating [[nuc]]s.\n\nFollowing the removal of the ripe queen cells the cloake board can be removed to re-establish the single united colony.\n\n===Alternate method \u2013 no grafting===\nA cloake board can also be employed to create queen cells on existing frames without grafting. The steps are basically the same as above with the following modifications:\n* Stage 2: Before sliding the solid divider in place, inspect the top brood box and determine there is at least one frame with new unhatched eggs. Multiple frames with new eggs will often result in multiple frames with queen cells.\n* Stage 3: N/A.\n* Stage 4: After finishing, you can either cut out the queen cells and place them in mating nucs, or place an entire frame with finished queen cells in a mating nuc.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cloake Board}}\n[[Category:Beekeeping tools]]\n[[Category:Beekeeping]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2017}}\n{{manual|date=May 2016}}\n{{Underlinked|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox tool\n| name           = Cloake Board\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = \n| other_name     = \n| classification = Beekeeping\n| types          = \n| used_with      = \n| inventor       = Harry Cloake\n| manufacturer   = \n| model          = \n| related        = \n}}\n\nA '''Cloake board''' is a special piece of equipment used in [[beekeeping]] to facilitate raising [[queen bee]]s.

Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways'''<!--that is the full, formal name; see the talk page or first citation-->, commonly known as the '''Interstate Highway System''', is a network of [[controlled-access highway]]s that forms part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] in the United States. Construction of the system was authorized by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]]. The system extends throughout the [[contiguous United States]] and has routes in [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]], and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe U.S. federal government first funded roadways through the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], and began an effort to construct a national road grid with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]]. After [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] became president in 1953, his administration developed a proposal for an interstate highway system, eventually resulting in the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Construction of the Interstate Highway System was proclaimed complete in 1992, though some planned routes were canceled and several routes have [[List of gaps in Interstate Highways|stretches that do not fully conform with federal standards]]. The cost of construction of the Interstate Highway System was approximately $114 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|425000000000|2006}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}). The original system has been expanded numerous times through the creation of new designations and the extension of existing designations.\n\nThough much of their construction was funded by the federal government, Interstate Highways are owned by the state in which they were built. All Interstates must meet [[Interstate Highway standards|federal standards]] such as having [[Controlled-access highway|controlled access]], using a minimal number of [[traffic light]]s, and complying with federal [[Road signs in the United States|traffic sign]] specifications. Interstate Highways use a numbering scheme in which primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers and shorter routes are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route. The Interstate Highway System is partially financed through the [[Highway Trust Fund]], which itself is funded by a federal [[fuel tax]].

Though local opposition led to the cancellation of this project in 1981, bridges and ramps for the connection into the \"north split\" remain visible.\n* [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Baltimore]] was supposed to run from the Baltimore Beltway ([[Interstate 695 in Maryland|Interstate 695]]), which surrounds the city to terminate at [[I-95]], the East Coast thoroughfare that runs through Maryland and Baltimore on a diagonal course, northeast to southwest; the connection was cancelled on the mid-1970s due to its routing through [[Gwynns Falls Leakin Park|Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park]], a wilderness urban park reserve following the [[Gwynns Falls]] stream through West Baltimore. This included the cancellation of [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|I-170]], partially built and in use as U.S. Route 40, and nicknamed the Highway to Nowhere.\n* [[Interstate 78 in New York|I-78]] in New York City was canceled along with portions with [[Interstate 278|I-278]], [[Interstate 478|I-478]], and [[Interstate 878|I-878]]. I-878 was supposed to be part of I-78, and I-478 and I-278 were to be spur routes.\n* [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] in San Francisco was originally planned to travel past the city's Civic Center along the Panhandle Freeway into [[Golden Gate Park]] and terminate at the original alignment of [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]]/[[California State Route 1|SR 1]]. The city canceled this and several other freeways in 1958. Similarly, more than 20 years later, Sacramento canceled plans to upgrade I-80 to Interstate Standards and rerouted the freeway on what was then I-880 that traveled north of Downtown Sacramento.\n* [[Interstate 83|I-83]], southern extension of the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] (southern [[I-83]]) in [[Baltimore]] was supposed run along the waterfront of the [[Patapsco River]] / [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]] to connect to [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], bisecting historic neighborhoods of [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] and [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]], but the connection was never built.\n* [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] through the [[District of Columbia]] into [[Maryland]] was abandoned in 1977.

This revolt also included the cancellation of the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]], connecting I-93 to [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]] and a cancelled section of the [[U.S. Route 3|Northwest Expressway]] which would have carried [[U.S. Route 3|Route 3]] inside the Route 128 beltway, meeting with [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].\n\n==Standards==\n{{Main|Interstate Highway standards}}\nThe [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the [[controlled-access highway|controlled access]] nature of the roads.

Other Interstates in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.\n\nIn some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]] is {{convert|50|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in downtown [[Cleveland]] because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of {{convert|35|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in a heavily congested area; [[Interstate 70 in West Virginia|I-70]] through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through the [[Wheeling Tunnel]] and most of downtown Wheeling; and [[Interstate 68|I-68]] has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|40|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through [[Cumberland, Maryland]], because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], for nearly 30&nbsp;years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than {{convert|9,000|lbs|kg}} [[gross vehicle weight]]. [[Interstate 93|I-93]] in [[Franconia Notch State Park]] in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80 and 84 in Utah have speed limits as high as {{convert|70|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} within the [[Salt Lake City]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] areas, and [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]] in New Mexico within the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]] areas along with [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in Texas along Odessa and [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Interstate 29 in North Dakota|I-29]] in North Dakota along the [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] area have higher speed limits of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Other uses===\nAs one of the components of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the [[Strategic Highway Network]], a system of roads identified as critical to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref name=\"slater_1996\">{{cite magazine |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |title = The National Highway System: A Commitment to America's Future |magazine = Public Roads |last = Slater |first = Rodney E. |date = Spring 1996 |volume = 59 |issue = 4 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |issn = 0033-3735 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141216112008/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |archive-date = December 16, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as [[contraflow lane reversal]], has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to [[Hurricane Georges]]' landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1999, lanes of [[Interstate 16 in Georgia|I-16]] and [[Interstate 26 in South Carolina|I-26]] were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of [[Hurricane Floyd]] with mixed results.<ref name=\"onewayout\">{{cite magazine |url = http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |title = \"One-Way-Out\": Contraflow Freeway Operation for Hurricane Evacuation |last = Wolshon |first = Brian |magazine = National Hazards Review |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 105\u2013112 |date = August 2001 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006200038/http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |archive-date = October 6, 2008 |doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2001)2:3(105) }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 contraflow was employed ahead of [[Hurricane Charley]] in the [[Tampa, Florida]] area and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] before the landfall of [[Hurricane Ivan]];<ref name=\"contraflow_ivan\">{{cite web |url = http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |title = Contraflow Implementation Experiences in the Southern Coastal States |publisher = [[Florida Department of Transportation]] |access-date = September 27, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025045623/http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |archive-date = October 25, 2007 |first = Tahira |last = Faquir |date = March 30, 2006 }}</ref> however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations.

Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western [[Interstate 84 (west)|I\u201184]] was I\u201180N, as it went north from [[Interstate 80|I\u201180]]. The new policy stated, \"No new divided numbers (such as [[Interstate 35W (disambiguation)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (disambiguation)|I-35E]], etc.) shall be adopted.\" The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] still exist in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] in Texas, and an [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] that run through [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota, still exist.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into [[Interstate 69W|I-69W]], [[Interstate 69E|I-69E]], and [[Interstate 69C|I-69C]] (for Central).<ref>{{cite news |last = Essex |first = Allen |title = State Adds I-69 to Interstate System |url = http://brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |access-date = July 17, 2013 |newspaper = The Brownsville Herald |date = May 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227191039/http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |archive-date = February 27, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> This is referred to as a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] or overlap. For example, [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I\u201175]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I\u201185]] share the same roadway in [[Atlanta]]; this {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}} section, called the [[Downtown Connector]], is labeled both I\u201175 and I\u201185. Concurrencies between Interstate and U.S. Route numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such [[wrong-way concurrency]] is found between [[Wytheville, Virginia|Wytheville]] and [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia|Fort Chiswell]], Virginia, where [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|I\u201181]] north and [[Interstate 77 in Virginia|I\u201177]] south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I\u201181 south and I\u201177 north.\n\n===Auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates===\n{{See also|List of auxiliary Interstate Highways}}\n[[File:FHWA Auxiliary Route Numbering Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Examples of the auxiliary Interstate Highway numbering system. An odd hundreds digit means the route connects at only one end to the rest of the interstate system, known as a \"spur route\". An even hundreds digit means the route connects at both ends, which could be a loop route (which has two termini) or a radial route (known also as a beltway, beltline, or circumferential route).]]\n\nAuxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve [[urban area]]s. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either east\u2013west or north\u2013south, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number. For instance, [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] in Massachusetts is labeled north\u2013south, while [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|I-195]] in New Jersey is labeled east\u2013west. Some looped Interstate routes use [[inner\u2013outer directions]] instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline.<ref name=\"fhwa_route_log\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |author = Federal Highway Administration |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = March 22, 2007 |access-date = January 23, 2008 |title = FHWA Route Log and Finder List |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010643/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |archive-date = June 5, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.\n\n===Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico===\n[[File:Puerto Rico Interstates.svg|thumb|Map of routes in [[Puerto Rico]] that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]\n[[File:Interstate Alaska map.png|thumb|Map of routes in Alaska that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]\n\nThe Interstate Highway System also extends to [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Puerto Rico]], even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.\n\nThe Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of [[Oahu]], carry the prefix '''H'''. There are three one-digit routes in the state ([[Interstate H-1|H-1]], [[Interstate H-2|H-2]], and [[Interstate H-3|H-3]]) and one auxiliary route ([[Interstate H-201|H-201]]). These Interstates connect several [[U.S. Air Force|military]] and [[U.S. Navy|naval]] bases together, as well as the important cities and towns spread across Oahu, and especially the metropolis of [[Honolulu]].\n\nBoth Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90&nbsp;percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The [[Interstate Highways in Alaska|Interstates of Alaska]] and [[Interstate Highways in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes '''A''' and '''PR''', respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official [[Interstate Highway standards]].<ref name=\"FHWA2\" />\n\n===Mile markers and exit numbers===\nOn one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west.  As with all guidelines for Interstate routes, however, numerous exceptions exist.\n\nThree-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location. In other words, mile marker&nbsp;1 on [[I-465]], a {{convert|53|mi|km|adj=on}} route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with I-65 on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker&nbsp;53 is just east of this same junction. An exception is [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of I-95.\n\nThe exit numbers of interchanges are either sequential or distance-based so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. Under the latter system, a single mile with multiple exits may be assigned letter suffixes, for example on [[Interstate 890|I\u2011890]] in New York.<ref name=\"INDOT-Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers & Exit Numbering\" >{{cite web |url = http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |access-date = November 26, 2011 |title = Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers & Exit Numbering |author = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = n.d. |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515104711/http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |archive-date = May 15, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Business routes===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 110\n|image1= Business Loop 80.svg\n|alt1= Business Loop Interstate 80 shield marker\n|image2= Business Spur 80.svg\n|alt2= Business Spur Interstate 80 shield marker\n|header= Standard Interstate shields\n|footer= Markers for Business Loop Interstate 80 (left) and Business Spur Interstate 80 (right)\n}}\nAASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations.

However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.\n\nAbout 70&nbsp;percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the [[fuel tax]]es collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on [[toll highway]]s and bridges. The federal gasoline tax was first imposed in 1932 at one cent per gallon; during the Eisenhower administration, the [[Highway Trust Fund]], established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5&nbsp;cents per gallon.

The system grew more rapidly than the rate of the taxes on fuel and other aspects of driving (e. g., excise tax on tires).\n\nThe rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5&nbsp;percent in 2007), as does about 60&nbsp;percent of the state contribution.

Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] (I-95) following the [[Mianus River Bridge]] collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway's construction bonds were paid off. In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from [[Interstate Highway standards]]. A notable example is the western approach to the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] in [[Philadelphia]], where [[Interstate 676|I-676]] has a surface street section through a historic area.\n\nPolicies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed.

Like other highways, Interstates feature [[Road signs in the United States#Guide|guide signs]] that list [[control cities]] to help direct drivers through interchanges and exits toward their desired destination. All [[Road signs in the United States|traffic sign]]s and [[lane]] markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.\n\nFor many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002\u2014Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.<ref>{{cite web |first = Daniel P. |last = Faigin |date = December 29, 2015 |url = http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |work = California Highways |title = Numbering Conventions: Post Miles |access-date = March 15, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190248/http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |archive-date = January 31, 2017 |url-status = live }}{{self-published source|date=March 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=March 2017}} In 2010\u20132011, the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] posted all new mile markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I\u201190 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I\u201194 section of the Tri\u2011State Tollway, which previously had matched the I\u2011294 section starting in the south at I\u201180/I\u201194/IL Route 394. The tollway also added exit number tabs to the exits.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nExit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On [[Interstate 19|I\u201119]] in [[Arizona]], however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a [[metric system]] of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric;<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Zhang |first1 = Sarah |date = October 7, 2014 |title = An Arizona Highway Has Used the Metric System Since the 80s |url = https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |website = Gizmodo |access-date = February 25, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103128/https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |archive-date = February 25, 2019 |url-status = live }}</ref>  proximity to metric-using [[Mexico]] may also have been a factor, as I\u201119 indirectly connects I\u201110 to the [[Mexican Federal Highway]] system via surface streets in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north.\n\nSome highways, including the [[New York State Thruway]], use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway count up from [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] traveling north, and then west from Albany. I\u201187 in New York State is numbered in three sections. The first section makes up the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in the [[Bronx]], with interchanges numbered sequentially from 1 to 14. The second section of I\u201187 is a part of the [[New York State Thruway]] that starts in Yonkers (exit&nbsp;1) and continues north to Albany (exit&nbsp;24); at Albany, the Thruway turns west and becomes I\u201190 for exits&nbsp;25 to 61. From Albany north to the Canadian border, the exits on I\u201187 are numbered sequentially from 1 to 44 along the [[Adirondack Northway]]. This often leads to confusion as there is more than one exit on I\u201187 with the same number. For example, exit&nbsp;4 on Thruway section of I\u201187 connects with the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, but exit&nbsp;4 on the Northway is the exit for the Albany airport. These two exits share a number but are located {{convert|150|mi}} apart.\n\nMany northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, regardless of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, five of the main Interstate Highways that remain completely within these states ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|87]], [[Interstate 88 (New York)|88]], [[Interstate 89|89]], [[Interstate 91|91]], and [[Interstate 93|93]]) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system for a number of years, but have since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], including the portions that are signed as I\u201195 and I\u201178, also has sequential numbering, but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.\n\n===Sign locations===\nThere are four common signage methods on Interstates:\n* Locating a sign on the ground to the side of the highway, mostly the right, and is used to denote exits, as well as [[rest area]]s, motorist services such as gas and lodging, recreational sites, and freeway names\n* Attaching the sign to an overpass\n* Mounting on full [[gantry (road sign)|gantries]] that bridge the entire width of the highway and often show two or more signs\n* Mounting on half-gantries that are located on one side of the highway, like a ground-mounted sign\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Volume===\n*

Tourism dramatically expanded as well, creating a demand for more service stations, motels, restaurants and visitor attractions.

Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways'''<!--that is the full, formal name; see the talk page or first citation-->, commonly known as the '''Interstate Highway System''', is a network of [[controlled-access highway]]s that forms part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] in the United States. Construction of the system was authorized by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]]. The system extends throughout the [[contiguous United States]] and has routes in [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]], and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe U.S. federal government first funded roadways through the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], and began an effort to construct a national road grid with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]]. After [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] became president in 1953, his administration developed a proposal for an interstate highway system, eventually resulting in the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Construction of the Interstate Highway System was proclaimed complete in 1992, though some planned routes were canceled and several routes have [[List of gaps in Interstate Highways|stretches that do not fully conform with federal standards]]. The cost of construction of the Interstate Highway System was approximately $114 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|425000000000|2006}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}). The original system has been expanded numerous times through the creation of new designations and the extension of existing designations.\n\nThough much of their construction was funded by the federal government, Interstate Highways are owned by the state in which they were built. All Interstates must meet [[Interstate Highway standards|federal standards]] such as having [[Controlled-access highway|controlled access]], using a minimal number of [[traffic light]]s, and complying with federal [[Road signs in the United States|traffic sign]] specifications. Interstate Highways use a numbering scheme in which primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers and shorter routes are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route. The Interstate Highway System is partially financed through the [[Highway Trust Fund]], which itself is funded by a federal [[fuel tax]]. Though federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls, some Interstate routes are [[toll road]]s.\n\n{{As of|2016}}, about one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country used the Interstate Highway System,<ref>{{cite report |author = Office of Highway Policy Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/vm1.cfm |title = Table VM-1: Annual Vehicle Distance Traveled in Miles and Related Data, 2016, by Highway Category and Vehicle Type |date = December 2017 |access-date = May 11, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180512044349/https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/vm1.cfm |archive-date = May 12, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref> which had a total length of {{convert|48,191|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"hm20\">{{cite report |author = Office of Highway Policy Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/hm20.cfm |title = Table HM-20: Public Road Length, 2016, Miles By Functional System |date = September 18, 2017 |access-date = May 11, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180512044020/https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/hm20.cfm |archive-date = May 12, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref> Several [[List of future Interstate Highways|future routes]] are in development.\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\n{{listen |filename=Cadillacsquareexcerpt.ogg |title=Remarks in Cadillac Square, Detroit |description=President Eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at [[Cadillac Square]] in Detroit on October 29, 1954<br />[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/audiotext.cfm#cadillac Text of speech excerpt]}}\n\nThe United States government's efforts to construct a national network of highways began on an ''ad hoc'' basis with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], which provided for $75 million over a five-year period for [[matching funds]] to the states for the construction and improvement of highways.<ref>{{cite book |first = Carlos Arnaldo |last = Schwantes |title = Going Places: Transportation Redefines the Twentieth-Century West |location = Bloomington |publisher = Indiana University Press |year = 2003 |isbn = 9780253342027 |ref = harv |page = 142 }}</ref> The nation's revenue needs associated with [[World War I]] prevented any significant implementation of this policy, which expired in 1921.\n\nIn December 1918, E.

Eisenhower initially preferred a system consisting of [[toll road]]s, but Clay convinced Eisenhower that toll roads were not feasible outside of the highly populated coastal regions. In February 1955, Eisenhower forwarded Clay's proposal to Congress. The bill quickly won approval in the Senate, but House Democrats objected to the use of public [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as the means to finance construction. Eisenhower and the House Democrats agreed to instead finance the system through the [[Highway Trust Fund]], which itself would be funded by a [[gasoline]] tax.<ref>{{harvp|Smith|2012|pp=651\u2013654|ps=.}}</ref> In June 1956, Eisenhower signed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] into law.

The planned [[Interstate 11|I-11]] will then bridge the Interstate gap between [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and thus form part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] (along with [[Interstate 19|I-19]], and portions of [[Interstate 10|I-10]] and [[Interstate 15|I-15]]) between [[Sonora]], Mexico and [[Alberta]], Canada.\n\n===Urban Interstates abandoned because of local opposition===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n{{main|Highway revolts in the United States}}\nPolitical opposition from residents canceled many freeway projects around the United States, including:\n* [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|I-40]] in Memphis, Tennessee was rerouted and part of the original I-40 is still in use as the eastern half of [[Sam Cooper Boulevard]].<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006a|pp=159\u2013160}}</ref>\n* [[Interstate 66|I-66]] in the [[District of Columbia]] was abandoned in 1977.\n* [[Interstate 69|I-69]] was to continue past its terminus at Interstate 465 to intersect with [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 65]] at the north split, northeast of downtown [[Indianapolis]]. Though local opposition led to the cancellation of this project in 1981, bridges and ramps for the connection into the \"north split\" remain visible.\n* [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Baltimore]] was supposed to run from the Baltimore Beltway ([[Interstate 695 in Maryland|Interstate 695]]), which surrounds the city to terminate at [[I-95]], the East Coast thoroughfare that runs through Maryland and Baltimore on a diagonal course, northeast to southwest; the connection was cancelled on the mid-1970s due to its routing through [[Gwynns Falls Leakin Park|Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park]], a wilderness urban park reserve following the [[Gwynns Falls]] stream through West Baltimore. This included the cancellation of [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|I-170]], partially built and in use as U.S. Route 40, and nicknamed the Highway to Nowhere.\n* [[Interstate 78 in New York|I-78]] in New York City was canceled along with portions with [[Interstate 278|I-278]], [[Interstate 478|I-478]], and [[Interstate 878|I-878]]. I-878 was supposed to be part of I-78, and I-478 and I-278 were to be spur routes.\n* [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] in San Francisco was originally planned to travel past the city's Civic Center along the Panhandle Freeway into [[Golden Gate Park]] and terminate at the original alignment of [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]]/[[California State Route 1|SR 1]]. The city canceled this and several other freeways in 1958. Similarly, more than 20 years later, Sacramento canceled plans to upgrade I-80 to Interstate Standards and rerouted the freeway on what was then I-880 that traveled north of Downtown Sacramento.\n* [[Interstate 83|I-83]], southern extension of the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] (southern [[I-83]]) in [[Baltimore]] was supposed run along the waterfront of the [[Patapsco River]] / [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]] to connect to [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], bisecting historic neighborhoods of [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] and [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]], but the connection was never built.\n* [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] through the [[District of Columbia]] into [[Maryland]] was abandoned in 1977. Instead it was rerouted to [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495 (Capital Beltway)]]. The completed section is now [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia\u2013Virginia)|I-395]].\n* [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] was originally planned to run up the [[Southwest Corridor (Massachusetts)|Southwest Expressway]] and meet [[Interstate 93|I-93]], where the two highways would travel along the [[Central Artery]] through downtown [[Boston]], but was rerouted onto the [[Massachusetts State Highway 128|Route 128]] beltway due to widespread opposition. This revolt also included the cancellation of the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]], connecting I-93 to [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]] and a cancelled section of the [[U.S. Route 3|Northwest Expressway]] which would have carried [[U.S. Route 3|Route 3]] inside the Route 128 beltway, meeting with [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].\n\n==Standards==\n{{Main|Interstate Highway standards}}\nThe [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the [[controlled-access highway|controlled access]] nature of the roads. With few [[List of gaps in Interstate Highways|exceptions]], [[traffic light]]s (and cross traffic in general) are limited to [[Toll house|toll booths]] and [[ramp meter]]s (metered flow control for lane merging during [[rush hour]]).\n\n===Speed limits===\n{{Further|Speed limits in the United States|National Maximum Speed Law}}\n[[File:2019-07-15 11 10 50 View south along Interstate 95 from the overpass for Maryland State Route 175 (Waterloo Road-Rouse Parkway) in Columbia, Howard County, Maryland.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Interstate 95|I-95]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]], built to modern standards]]\nBeing [[Controlled-access highway|freeways]], Interstate Highways usually have the highest [[speed limit]]s in a given area.

Several portions of various highways such as [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] and [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in rural western Texas, [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] in Nevada between Fernley and Winnemucca (except around Lovelock) and portions of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]], [[Interstate 70 in Utah|I-70]], [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]], and [[Interstate 84 in Utah|I-84]] in Utah have a speed limit of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}. Other Interstates in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.\n\nIn some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]] is {{convert|50|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in downtown [[Cleveland]] because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of {{convert|35|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in a heavily congested area; [[Interstate 70 in West Virginia|I-70]] through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through the [[Wheeling Tunnel]] and most of downtown Wheeling; and [[Interstate 68|I-68]] has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|40|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through [[Cumberland, Maryland]], because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], for nearly 30&nbsp;years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than {{convert|9,000|lbs|kg}} [[gross vehicle weight]]. [[Interstate 93|I-93]] in [[Franconia Notch State Park]] in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80 and 84 in Utah have speed limits as high as {{convert|70|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} within the [[Salt Lake City]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] areas, and [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]] in New Mexico within the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]] areas along with [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in Texas along Odessa and [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Interstate 29 in North Dakota|I-29]] in North Dakota along the [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] area have higher speed limits of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Other uses===\nAs one of the components of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the [[Strategic Highway Network]], a system of roads identified as critical to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref name=\"slater_1996\">{{cite magazine |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |title = The National Highway System: A Commitment to America's Future |magazine = Public Roads |last = Slater |first = Rodney E. |date = Spring 1996 |volume = 59 |issue = 4 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |issn = 0033-3735 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141216112008/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |archive-date = December 16, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as [[contraflow lane reversal]], has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to [[Hurricane Georges]]' landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1999, lanes of [[Interstate 16 in Georgia|I-16]] and [[Interstate 26 in South Carolina|I-26]] were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of [[Hurricane Floyd]] with mixed results.<ref name=\"onewayout\">{{cite magazine |url = http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |title = \"One-Way-Out\": Contraflow Freeway Operation for Hurricane Evacuation |last = Wolshon |first = Brian |magazine = National Hazards Review |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 105\u2013112 |date = August 2001 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006200038/http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |archive-date = October 6, 2008 |doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2001)2:3(105) }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 contraflow was employed ahead of [[Hurricane Charley]] in the [[Tampa, Florida]] area and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] before the landfall of [[Hurricane Ivan]];<ref name=\"contraflow_ivan\">{{cite web |url = http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |title = Contraflow Implementation Experiences in the Southern Coastal States |publisher = [[Florida Department of Transportation]] |access-date = September 27, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025045623/http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |archive-date = October 25, 2007 |first = Tahira |last = Faquir |date = March 30, 2006 }}</ref> however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations.

Some such highways are incomplete Interstates (such as [[Interstate 69|I-69]] and [[Interstate 74|I-74]]) and some just happen to share route designations (such as [[Interstate 76 (disambiguation)|I-76]], [[Interstate 84 (disambiguation)|I-84]], [[Interstate 86 (disambiguation)|I\u201186]], [[Interstate 87 (disambiguation)|I-87]], and [[Interstate 88 (disambiguation)|I-88]]). Some of these were due to a change in the numbering system as a result of a new policy adopted in 1973. Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western [[Interstate 84 (west)|I\u201184]] was I\u201180N, as it went north from [[Interstate 80|I\u201180]]. The new policy stated, \"No new divided numbers (such as [[Interstate 35W (disambiguation)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (disambiguation)|I-35E]], etc.) shall be adopted.\" The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] still exist in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] in Texas, and an [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] that run through [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota, still exist.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into [[Interstate 69W|I-69W]], [[Interstate 69E|I-69E]], and [[Interstate 69C|I-69C]] (for Central).<ref>{{cite news |last = Essex |first = Allen |title = State Adds I-69 to Interstate System |url = http://brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |access-date = July 17, 2013 |newspaper = The Brownsville Herald |date = May 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227191039/http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |archive-date = February 27, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> This is referred to as a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] or overlap. For example, [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I\u201175]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I\u201185]] share the same roadway in [[Atlanta]]; this {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}} section, called the [[Downtown Connector]], is labeled both I\u201175 and I\u201185. Concurrencies between Interstate and U.S. Route numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable.<ref name=\"aashto_ho2\" /> In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such [[wrong-way concurrency]] is found between [[Wytheville, Virginia|Wytheville]] and [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia|Fort Chiswell]], Virginia, where [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|I\u201181]] north and [[Interstate 77 in Virginia|I\u201177]] south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I\u201181 south and I\u201177 north.\n\n===Auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates===\n{{See also|List of auxiliary Interstate Highways}}\n[[File:FHWA Auxiliary Route Numbering Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Examples of the auxiliary Interstate Highway numbering system. An odd hundreds digit means the route connects at only one end to the rest of the interstate system, known as a \"spur route\". An even hundreds digit means the route connects at both ends, which could be a loop route (which has two termini) or a radial route (known also as a beltway, beltline, or circumferential route).]]\n\nAuxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve [[urban area]]s. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either east\u2013west or north\u2013south, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number. For instance, [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] in Massachusetts is labeled north\u2013south, while [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|I-195]] in New Jersey is labeled east\u2013west. Some looped Interstate routes use [[inner\u2013outer directions]] instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline.<ref name=\"fhwa_route_log\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |author = Federal Highway Administration |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = March 22, 2007 |access-date = January 23, 2008 |title = FHWA Route Log and Finder List |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010643/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |archive-date = June 5, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.\n\n===Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico===\n[[File:Puerto Rico Interstates.svg|thumb|Map of routes in [[Puerto Rico]] that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]\n[[File:Interstate Alaska map.png|thumb|Map of routes in Alaska that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]\n\nThe Interstate Highway System also extends to [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Puerto Rico]], even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.\n\nThe Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of [[Oahu]], carry the prefix '''H'''. There are three one-digit routes in the state ([[Interstate H-1|H-1]], [[Interstate H-2|H-2]], and [[Interstate H-3|H-3]]) and one auxiliary route ([[Interstate H-201|H-201]]). These Interstates connect several [[U.S. Air Force|military]] and [[U.S. Navy|naval]] bases together, as well as the important cities and towns spread across Oahu, and especially the metropolis of [[Honolulu]].\n\nBoth Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90&nbsp;percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The [[Interstate Highways in Alaska|Interstates of Alaska]] and [[Interstate Highways in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes '''A''' and '''PR''', respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official [[Interstate Highway standards]].<ref name=\"FHWA2\" />\n\n===Mile markers and exit numbers===\nOn one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west.  As with all guidelines for Interstate routes, however, numerous exceptions exist.\n\nThree-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location. In other words, mile marker&nbsp;1 on [[I-465]], a {{convert|53|mi|km|adj=on}} route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with I-65 on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker&nbsp;53 is just east of this same junction. An exception is [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of I-95.\n\nThe exit numbers of interchanges are either sequential or distance-based so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. Under the latter system, a single mile with multiple exits may be assigned letter suffixes, for example on [[Interstate 890|I\u2011890]] in New York.<ref name=\"INDOT-Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers & Exit Numbering\" >{{cite web |url = http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |access-date = November 26, 2011 |title = Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers & Exit Numbering |author = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = n.d. |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515104711/http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |archive-date = May 15, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Business routes===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 110\n|image1= Business Loop 80.svg\n|alt1= Business Loop Interstate 80 shield marker\n|image2= Business Spur 80.svg\n|alt2= Business Spur Interstate 80 shield marker\n|header= Standard Interstate shields\n|footer= Markers for Business Loop Interstate 80 (left) and Business Spur Interstate 80 (right)\n}}\nAASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations.

However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.\n\nAbout 70&nbsp;percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the [[fuel tax]]es collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on [[toll highway]]s and bridges. The federal gasoline tax was first imposed in 1932 at one cent per gallon; during the Eisenhower administration, the [[Highway Trust Fund]], established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5&nbsp;cents per gallon.

The system grew more rapidly than the rate of the taxes on fuel and other aspects of driving (e. g., excise tax on tires).\n\nThe rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5&nbsp;percent in 2007), as does about 60&nbsp;percent of the state contribution.

Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] (I-95) following the [[Mianus River Bridge]] collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway's construction bonds were paid off. In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from [[Interstate Highway standards]]. A notable example is the western approach to the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] in [[Philadelphia]], where [[Interstate 676|I-676]] has a surface street section through a historic area.\n\nPolicies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed. The [[Federal Highway Administration]] has allowed some states to collect tolls on existing Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of [[Interstate 376|I-376]] included a section of [[Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;60]] that was tolled by the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer toll facilities (like the tolled section of I-376, which was built in the early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the ''[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]'' in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow \"Toll\" sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url = http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/shsm_interim/index.htm |chapter = Interim Releases for New and Revised Signs |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = November 16, 2011 |title = Standard Highway Signs and Markings |access-date = March 10, 2012 |author = Federal Highway Administration }}</ref>\n\nLegislation passed in 2005 known as [[SAFETEA-LU]], encouraged states to construct new Interstate Highways through \"innovative financing\" methods. SAFETEA-LU facilitated states to pursue innovative financing by easing the restrictions on building interstates as toll roads, either through state agencies or through [[public\u2013private partnership]]s. However, SAFETEA-LU left in place a prohibition of installing tolls on existing toll-free Interstates, and states wishing to toll such routes to finance upgrades and repairs must first seek approval from Congress.\n\n===Chargeable and non-chargeable Interstate routes===\nInterstate Highways financed with federal funds are known as \"chargeable\" Interstate routes, and are considered part of the {{convert|42000|mi|km|adj=on}} network of highways.

Like other highways, Interstates feature [[Road signs in the United States#Guide|guide signs]] that list [[control cities]] to help direct drivers through interchanges and exits toward their desired destination. All [[Road signs in the United States|traffic sign]]s and [[lane]] markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.\n\nFor many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002\u2014Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.<ref>{{cite web |first = Daniel P. |last = Faigin |date = December 29, 2015 |url = http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |work = California Highways |title = Numbering Conventions: Post Miles |access-date = March 15, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190248/http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |archive-date = January 31, 2017 |url-status = live }}{{self-published source|date=March 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=March 2017}} In 2010\u20132011, the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] posted all new mile markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I\u201190 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I\u201194 section of the Tri\u2011State Tollway, which previously had matched the I\u2011294 section starting in the south at I\u201180/I\u201194/IL Route 394. The tollway also added exit number tabs to the exits.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nExit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On [[Interstate 19|I\u201119]] in [[Arizona]], however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a [[metric system]] of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric;<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Zhang |first1 = Sarah |date = October 7, 2014 |title = An Arizona Highway Has Used the Metric System Since the 80s |url = https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |website = Gizmodo |access-date = February 25, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103128/https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |archive-date = February 25, 2019 |url-status = live }}</ref>  proximity to metric-using [[Mexico]] may also have been a factor, as I\u201119 indirectly connects I\u201110 to the [[Mexican Federal Highway]] system via surface streets in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north.\n\nSome highways, including the [[New York State Thruway]], use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway count up from [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] traveling north, and then west from Albany. I\u201187 in New York State is numbered in three sections. The first section makes up the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in the [[Bronx]], with interchanges numbered sequentially from 1 to 14. The second section of I\u201187 is a part of the [[New York State Thruway]] that starts in Yonkers (exit&nbsp;1) and continues north to Albany (exit&nbsp;24); at Albany, the Thruway turns west and becomes I\u201190 for exits&nbsp;25 to 61. From Albany north to the Canadian border, the exits on I\u201187 are numbered sequentially from 1 to 44 along the [[Adirondack Northway]]. This often leads to confusion as there is more than one exit on I\u201187 with the same number. For example, exit&nbsp;4 on Thruway section of I\u201187 connects with the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, but exit&nbsp;4 on the Northway is the exit for the Albany airport. These two exits share a number but are located {{convert|150|mi}} apart.\n\nMany northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, regardless of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, five of the main Interstate Highways that remain completely within these states ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|87]], [[Interstate 88 (New York)|88]], [[Interstate 89|89]], [[Interstate 91|91]], and [[Interstate 93|93]]) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system for a number of years, but have since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], including the portions that are signed as I\u201195 and I\u201178, also has sequential numbering, but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.\n\n===Sign locations===\nThere are four common signage methods on Interstates:\n* Locating a sign on the ground to the side of the highway, mostly the right, and is used to denote exits, as well as [[rest area]]s, motorist services such as gas and lodging, recreational sites, and freeway names\n* Attaching the sign to an overpass\n* Mounting on full [[gantry (road sign)|gantries]] that bridge the entire width of the highway and often show two or more signs\n* Mounting on half-gantries that are located on one side of the highway, like a ground-mounted sign\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Volume===\n*

Tourism dramatically expanded as well, creating a demand for more service stations, motels, restaurants and visitor attractions. There was much more long-distance movement to the [[Sun Belt]] for winter vacations, or for permanent relocation, with convenient access to visits to relatives back home.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - a [[naval orange]] and the main protagonist of the show. He is thought to be incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises (even his \"Nya Nya\" and his \"motorboat\"), and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths. Orange likes to make puns and jokes, usually punctuates with his signature laugh.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - a Bartlet pear and the deuteragonist of the show. He is the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series. As a result, Pear has confirmed to try to perform extreme things to deny the idea of him being boring.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel. His catchphrase is \"Neato burrito!\"\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is a cute marshmallow Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances. Marshmallow says, \"Yay!\" a lot and has a cheeky giggle.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods, although he usually fails at his tasks.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment. Grapefruit is also in love with Passion, although she doesn't like him.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies,\" a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, usually punctuated with \"Ew!,\" as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]''\n}}\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

(Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - a [[naval orange]] and the main protagonist of the show. He is thought to be incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises (even his \"Nya Nya\" and his \"motorboat\"), and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths. Orange's laugh is recognizable and likes to make puns and jokes.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - a Bartlet pear and the deuteragonist of the show. He is the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series. As a result, Pear has confirmed to try to perform extreme things to deny the idea of him being boring.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel. His catchphrase is \"Neato burrito!\"\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is a cute marshmallow Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances. Marshmallow says, \"Yay!\" a lot and has a cheeky giggle.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods, although he usually fails at his tasks.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment. Grapefruit is also in love with Passion, although she doesn't like him.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies,\" a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, usually punctuated with \"Ew!,\" as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]''\n}}\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added.
